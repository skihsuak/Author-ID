<s> emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home
and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
existence </s>
<s>  and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world with very
little to distress or vex her </s>
<s> 

she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate
indulgent father </s>
<s>  and had in consequence of her sisters marriage been
mistress of his house from a very early period </s>
<s>  her mother had died
too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of
her caresses </s>
<s>  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection </s>
<s> 

sixteen years had miss taylor been in <abvr> woodhouses family less as a
governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly
of emma </s>
<s>  between them it was more the intimacy of sisters </s>
<s>  even before
miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the
mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint </s>
<s> 
and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been
living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma
doing just what she liked </s>
<s>  highly esteeming miss taylors judgment but
directed chiefly by her own </s>
<s> 

the real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too
well of herself </s>
<s>  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to
her many enjoyments </s>
<s>  the danger however was at present so unperceived
that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her </s>
<s> 

sorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness </s>
<s> miss taylor married </s>
<s>  it was miss taylors
loss which first brought grief </s>
<s>  it was on the weddingday of this
beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any
continuance </s>
<s>  the wedding over and the bridepeople gone her father and
herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer
a long evening </s>
<s>  her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as
usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost </s>
<s> 

the event had every promise of happiness for her friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and
pleasant manners </s>
<s>  and there was some satisfaction in considering
with what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished and
promoted the match </s>
<s>  but it was a black mornings work for her </s>

of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day </s>

taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had
devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how
nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood </s>
<s>  a large debt of
gratitude was owing here </s>
<s>  but the intercourse of the last seven
years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed
isabellas marriage on their being left to each other was yet a
dearer tenderer recollection </s>
<s>  she had been a friend and companion such
as few possessed </s>
<s>  intelligent wellinformed useful gentle knowing
all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and
peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of
hersone to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had
such an affection for her as could never find fault </s>
<s> 

how was she to bear the change </s>
<s> it was true that her friend was going
only half a mile from them </s>
<s>  but emma was aware that great must be the
difference between a <abvr> weston only half a mile from them and a miss
taylor in the house </s>
<s>  and with all her advantages natural and domestic
she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude </s>
<s>  she
dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her </s>
<s>  he could not
meet her in conversation rational or playful </s>
<s> 

the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and <abvr> woodhouse had
not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits </s>
<s> 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of
mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years </s>
<s>  and though
everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable
temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time </s>
<s> 

her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being
settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily
reach </s>
<s>  and many a long october and november evening must be struggled
through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from
isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house
and give her pleasant society again </s>
<s> 

highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town
to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and
name did really belong afforded her no equals </s>
<s>  the woodhouses
were first in consequence there </s>
<s>  all looked up to them </s>
<s>  she had many
acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but
not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even
half a day </s>
<s>  it was a melancholy change </s>
<s>  and emma could not but sigh over
it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it
necessary to be cheerful </s>
<s>  his spirits required support </s>
<s>  he was a nervous
man easily depressed </s>
<s>  fond of every body that he was used to and
hating to part with them </s>
<s>  hating change of every kind </s>
<s>  matrimony as the
origin of change was always disagreeable </s>
<s>  and he was by no means yet
reconciled to his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her
but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too </s>
<s>  and from his
habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that
other people could feel differently from himself he was very much
disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for
them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the
rest of her life at hartfield </s>
<s>  emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully
as she could to keep him from such thoughts </s>
<s>  but when tea came it was
impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner

curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner </s>

not at all sir </s>

ah </s>

<s> 

poor <abvr> and miss woodhouse if you please </s>
<s>  but i cannot possibly say
˜poor miss taylor </s>
<s>  i have a great regard for you and emma </s>
<s>  but when it
comes to the question of dependence or independence </s>
<s> at any rate it
must be better to have only one to please than two </s>
<s> 

especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome
creature </s>
<s>  said emma playfully </s>
<s>  that is what you have in your head i
knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by </s>
<s> 

i believe it is very true my dear indeed said <abvr> woodhouse with a
sigh </s>
<s>  i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome </s>
<s> 

my dearest papa </s>
<s>  you do not think i could mean you or suppose <abvr>
knightley to mean you </s>

<s>  oh no </s>
<s>  i meant only
myself </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley loves to find fault with me you knowin a

<s>  we always say what we like to one another </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults
in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them </s>
<s>  and
though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew
it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him
really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by
every body </s>
<s> 

emma knows i never flatter her said <abvr> knightley but i meant no
reflection on any body </s>
<s>  miss taylor has been used to have two persons
to please </s>
<s>  she will now have but one </s>

gainer </s>
<s> 

well said emma willing to let it passyou want to hear about
the wedding </s>

charmingly </s>
<s>  every body was punctual every body in their best looks </s>

a tear and hardly a long face to be seen </s>
<s>  oh no </s>
<s>  we all felt that we
were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every
day </s>
<s> 

dear emma bears every thing so well said her father </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am
sure she will miss her more than she thinks for </s>
<s> 

emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles </s>
<s>  it
is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s>  we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could
suppose it </s>
<s>  but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylors
advantage </s>
<s>  she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylors
time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to
her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow
herself to feel so much pain as pleasure </s>
<s>  every friend of miss taylor
must be glad to have her so happily married </s>
<s> 

and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very
considerable onethat i made the match myself </s>
<s>  i made the match you
know four years ago </s>
<s>  and to have it take place and be proved in the
right when so many people said <abvr> weston would never marry again may
comfort me for any thing </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley shook his head at her </s>
<s>  her father fondly replied ah </s>
<s> 
my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for
whatever you say always comes to pass </s>
<s>  pray do not make any more
matches </s>
<s> 

i promise you to make none for myself papa </s>
<s>  but i must indeed for
other people </s>
<s>  it is the greatest amusement in the world </s>
<s>  and after such
success you know </s>
<s> every body said that <abvr> weston would never marry
again </s>
<s>  oh dear no </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston who had been a widower so long and who
seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied
either in his business in town or among his friends here always
acceptable wherever he went always cheerfulmr </s>
<s>  weston need not spend
a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it </s>
<s>  oh no </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston certainly would never marry again </s>
<s>  some people even talked of a
promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the
uncle not letting him </s>
<s>  all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the
subject but i believed none of it </s>
<s> 

ever since the dayabout four years agothat miss taylor and i met
with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted
away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject </s>
<s>  i planned the match
from that hour </s>
<s>  and when such success has blessed me in this instance
dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off matchmaking </s>
<s> 

i do not understand what you mean by ˜success said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 
success supposes endeavour </s>
<s>  your time has been properly and delicately
spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
about this marriage </s>
<s>  a worthy employment for a young ladys mind </s>
<s>  but
if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means
only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day ˜i think it
would be a very good thing for miss taylor if <abvr> weston were to marry
her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why
do you talk of success </s>
<s>  where is your merit </s>

<s>  you
made a lucky guess </s>
<s>  and that is all that can be said </s>
<s> 

and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess </s>
<s> i
pity you </s>
<s> i thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucky guess is
never merely luck </s>
<s>  there is always some talent in it </s>
<s>  and as to my
poor word ˜success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so
entirely without any claim to it </s>
<s>  you have drawn two pretty pictures </s>
<s> 
but i think there may be a thirda something between the donothing and
the doall </s>
<s>  if i had not promoted <abvr> westons visits here and given
many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might
not have come to any thing after all </s>
<s>  i think you must know hartfield
enough to comprehend that </s>
<s> 

a straightforward openhearted man like weston and a rational
unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their
own concerns </s>
<s>  you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than
good to them by interference </s>
<s> 

emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined

chapter ii


mr </s>
<s>  weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property </s>
<s>  he had received a good education but on
succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed
for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged
and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering
into the militia of his county then embodied </s>
<s> 

captain weston was a general favourite </s>
<s>  and when the chances of his
military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire
family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized
except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were
full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend </s>
<s> 

miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her
fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestatewas
not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the
infinite mortification of <abvr> and <abvr> churchill who threw her off with
due decorum </s>
<s>  it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much
happiness </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston ought to have found more in it for she had a
husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due
to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him </s>
<s> 
but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best </s>
<s>  she had
resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother
but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brothers
unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home </s>
<s> 
they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison
of enscombe </s>
<s>  she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at
once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe </s>
<s> 

captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills
as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of
the bargain </s>
<s>  for when his wife died after a three years marriage he
was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain </s>
<s> 
from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved </s>
<s>  the boy
had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his
mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation </s>
<s>  and <abvr> and <abvr>
churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature
of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the
little frank soon after her decease </s>
<s>  some scruples and some reluctance
the widowerfather may be supposed to have felt </s>
<s>  but as they were
overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and
the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek
and his own situation to improve as he could </s>
<s> 

a complete change of life became desirable </s>
<s>  he quitted the militia and
engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in
london which afforded him a favourable opening </s>
<s>  it was a concern which
brought just employment enough </s>
<s>  he had still a small house in highbury
where most of his leisure days were spent </s>
<s>  and between useful occupation
and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his
life passed cheerfully away </s>
<s>  he had by that time realised an easy
competenceenough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining
highbury which he had always longed forenough to marry a woman as
portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of
his own friendly and social disposition </s>
<s> 

it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his
schemes </s>
<s>  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth
it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could
purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to </s>
<s> 
but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were
accomplished </s>
<s>  he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained
his wife </s>
<s>  and was beginning a new period of existence with every
probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through </s>
<s>  he had
never been an unhappy man </s>
<s>  his own temper had secured him from that
even in his first marriage </s>
<s>  but his second must shew him how delightful
a welljudging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the
pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be
chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it </s>
<s> 

he had only himself to please in his choice </s>
<s>  his fortune was his own </s>
<s> 
for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his
uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume
the name of churchill on coming of age </s>
<s>  it was most unlikely therefore
that he should ever want his fathers assistance </s>
<s>  his father had no
apprehension of it </s>
<s>  the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her
husband entirely </s>
<s>  but it was not in <abvr> westons nature to imagine that
any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he
believed so deservedly dear </s>
<s>  he saw his son every year in london and
was proud of him </s>
<s>  and his fond report of him as a very fine young man
had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too </s>
<s>  he was looked on as
sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a
kind of common concern </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life </s>
<s>  his coming to visit
his father had been often talked of but never achieved </s>
<s> 

now upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed as a
most proper attention that the visit should take place </s>
<s>  there was not a
dissentient voice on the subject either when <abvr> perry drank tea with
mrs </s>
<s>  and miss bates or when <abvr> and miss bates returned the visit </s>
<s>  now
was the time for <abvr> frank churchill to come among them </s>
<s>  and the hope
strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new
mother on the occasion </s>
<s>  for a few days every morning visit in highbury
included some mention of the handsome letter <abvr> weston had received </s>
<s> 
i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter <abvr> frank churchill
has written to <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i understand it was a very handsome letter
indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse told me of it </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse saw the letter and
he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life </s>
<s> 

it was indeed a highly prized letter </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had of course
formed a very favourable idea of the young man </s>
<s>  and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most
welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation
which her marriage had already secured </s>
<s>  she felt herself a most
fortunate woman </s>
<s>  and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate
she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial
separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and
who could ill bear to part with her </s>
<s> 

she knew that at times she must be missed </s>
<s>  and could not think without
pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering an hours ennui
from the want of her companionableness </s>
<s>  but dear emma was of no feeble
character </s>
<s>  she was more equal to her situation than most girls would
have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped
would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and
privations </s>
<s>  and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of
randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking
and in <abvr> westons disposition and circumstances which would make the
approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in
the week together </s>
<s> 

her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to <abvr>
weston and of moments only of regret </s>
<s>  and her satisfactionher more
than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent
that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize
at his being still able to pity ˜poor miss taylor when they left her
at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away
in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her
own </s>
<s>  but never did she go without <abvr> woodhouses giving a gentle sigh
and saying ah poor miss taylor </s>
<s>  she would be very glad to stay </s>
<s> 

there was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of ceasing to
pity her </s>
<s>  but a few weeks brought some alleviation to <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s> 
the compliments of his neighbours were over </s>
<s>  he was no longer teased by
being wished joy of so sorrowful an event </s>
<s>  and the weddingcake which
had been a great distress to him was all eat up </s>
<s>  his own stomach
could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be
different from himself </s>
<s>  what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit
for any body </s>
<s>  and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them
from having any weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as
earnestly tried to prevent any bodys eating it </s>
<s>  he had been at the
pains of consulting <abvr> perry the apothecary on the subject </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry
was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of <abvr> woodhouses life </s>
<s>  and upon being applied to he
could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias
of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree with
manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately </s>
<s>  with such an
opinion in confirmation of his own <abvr> woodhouse hoped to influence
every visitor of the newly married pair </s>
<s>  but still the cake was eaten </s>
<s> 
and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone </s>
<s> 

there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being
seen with a slice of <abvr> westons weddingcake in their hands </s>

woodhouse would never believe it </s>

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was fond of society in his own way </s>
<s>  he liked very much to
have his friends come and see him </s>
<s>  and from various united causes from
his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune
his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his
own little circle in a great measure as he liked </s>
<s>  he had not much
intercourse with any families beyond that circle </s>
<s>  his horror of late
hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit for any acquaintance but
such as would visit him on his own terms </s>
<s>  fortunately for him highbury
including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish
adjoining the seat of <abvr> knightley comprehended many such </s>
<s>  not
unfrequently through emmas persuasion he had some of the chosen and
the best to dine with him </s>
<s>  but evening parties were what he preferred </s>
<s> 
and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there
was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a
cardtable for him </s>
<s> 

real longstanding regard brought the westons and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and by
mr </s>
<s>  elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege
of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the
elegancies and society of <abvr> woodhouses drawingroom and the smiles
of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away </s>
<s> 

after these came a second set </s>
<s>  among the most comeatable of whom were
mrs </s>
<s>  and miss bates and <abvr> goddard three ladies almost always at
the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and
carried home so often that <abvr> woodhouse thought it no hardship for
either james or the horses </s>
<s>  had it taken place only once a year it
would have been a grievance </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old
lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille </s>
<s>  she lived with her
single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the
regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward
circumstances can excite </s>
<s>  her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree
of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married </s>
<s> 
miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having
much of the public favour </s>
<s>  and she had no intellectual superiority to
make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into
outward respect </s>
<s>  she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness </s>
<s>  her
youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible </s>
<s>  and yet she was a happy woman and a woman
whom no one named without goodwill </s>
<s>  it was her own universal goodwill
and contented temper which worked such wonders </s>
<s>  she loved every body
was interested in every bodys happiness quicksighted to every bodys
merits </s>
<s>  thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with
blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours
and friends and a home that wanted for nothing </s>
<s>  the simplicity and
cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a
recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself </s>
<s>  she was
a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited <abvr> woodhouse
full of trivial communications and harmless gossip </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary or an
establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of
refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality
upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous
pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real
honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable quantity of
accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might
be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little
education without any danger of coming back prodigies </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddards
school was in high reputeand very deservedly </s>
<s>  for highbury was
reckoned a particularly healthy spot </s>
<s>  she had an ample house and garden
gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great
deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own
hands </s>
<s>  it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her to church </s>
<s>  she was a plain motherly kind of woman who
had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the
occasional holiday of a teavisit </s>
<s>  and having formerly owed much to <abvr>
woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat
parlour hung round with fancywork whenever she could and win or lose
a few sixpences by his fireside </s>
<s> 

these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to
collect </s>
<s>  and happy was she for her fathers sake in the power </s>
<s>  though
as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and
very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well </s>
<s>  but the
quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so
spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated </s>
<s> 

as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the
present day a note was brought from <abvr> goddard requesting in most
respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her </s>
<s>  a most
welcome request </s>
<s>  for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew
very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of
her beauty </s>
<s>  a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no
longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion </s>
<s> 

harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody </s>
<s>  somebody had placed
her several years back at <abvr> goddards school and somebody
had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of
parlourboarder </s>
<s>  this was all that was generally known of her history </s>
<s> 
she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and
was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young
ladies who had been at school there with her </s>
<s> 

she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort
which emma particularly admired </s>
<s>  she was short plump and fair with a
fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great
sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased
with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths
conversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot
inconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing
shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed
by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had
been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement </s>
<s> 
encouragement should be given </s>
<s>  those soft blue eyes and all those
natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury
and its connexions </s>
<s>  the acquaintance she had already formed were
unworthy of her </s>
<s>  the friends from whom she had just parted though very
good sort of people must be doing her harm </s>
<s>  they were a family of the
name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large
farm of <abvr> knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery
creditably she believedshe knew <abvr> knightley thought highly of
thembut they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the
intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect </s>
<s>  she would notice her </s>
<s>  she would improve her </s>
<s>  she
would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good
society </s>
<s>  she would form her opinions and her manners </s>
<s>  it would be an
interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking </s>
<s>  highly becoming her
own situation in life her leisure and powers </s>
<s> 

she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and
listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that the
evening flew away at a very unusual rate </s>
<s>  and the suppertable which
always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and
watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the
fire before she was aware </s>
<s>  with an alacrity beyond the common impulse
of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every
thing well and attentively with the real goodwill of a mind delighted
with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and
help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an
urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil
scruples of their guests </s>
<s> 

upon such occasions poor <abvr> woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare </s>
<s> 
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his
youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him
rather sorry to see any thing put on it </s>
<s>  and while his hospitality would
have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health
made him grieve that they would eat </s>
<s> 

such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could
with thorough selfapprobation recommend </s>
<s>  though he might constrain
himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to
say </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs </s>
<s>  an egg
boiled very soft is not unwholesome </s>
<s>  serle understands boiling an egg
better than any body </s>
<s>  i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body
else </s>
<s>  but you need not be afraid they are very small you seeone of
our small eggs will not hurt you </s>
<s>  miss bates let emma help you to a
little bit of tarta very little bit </s>
<s>  ours are all appletarts </s>
<s>  you
need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here </s>
<s>  i do not advise the
custard </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddard what say you to half a glass of wine </s>
<s>  a
small halfglass put into a tumbler of water </s>
<s>  i do not think it could
disagree with you </s>
<s> 

emma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in a much
more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular
pleasure in sending them away happy </s>
<s>  the happiness of miss smith was
quite equal to her intentions </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse was so great a personage
in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much
panic as pleasure </s>
<s>  but the humble grateful little girl went off with
highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss
woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands
with her at last </s>

chapter iv


harriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing </s>
<s>  quick
and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and
telling her to come very often </s>
<s>  and as their acquaintance increased so
did their satisfaction in each other </s>
<s>  as a walking companion emma had
very early foreseen how useful she might find her </s>
<s>  in that respect
mrs </s>
<s>  westons loss had been important </s>
<s>  her father never went beyond the
shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long
walk or his short as the year varied </s>
<s>  and since <abvr> westons marriage
her exercise had been too much confined </s>
<s>  she had ventured once alone to
randalls but it was not pleasant </s>
<s>  and a harriet smith therefore
one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable
addition to her privileges </s>
<s>  but in every respect as she saw more of
her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs </s>
<s> 

harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful
disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be
guided by any one she looked up to </s>
<s>  her early attachment to herself
was very amiable </s>
<s>  and her inclination for good company and power of
appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no
want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected </s>
<s> 
altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smiths being exactly the
young friend she wantedexactly the something which her home required </s>
<s> 
such a friend as <abvr> weston was out of the question </s>
<s>  two such could
never be granted </s>
<s>  two such she did not want </s>
<s>  it was quite a different
sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was the
object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem </s>
<s>  harriet
would be loved as one to whom she could be useful </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston there
was nothing to be done </s>
<s>  for harriet every thing </s>
<s> 

her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents but harriet could not tell </s>
<s>  she was ready to tell
every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain </s>
<s>  emma
was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never believe that in
the same situation she should not have discovered the truth </s>
<s>  harriet
had no penetration </s>
<s>  she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard chose to tell her </s>
<s>  and looked no farther </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of
the school in general formed naturally a great part of the
conversationand but for her acquaintance with the martins of
abbeymill farm it must have been the whole </s>
<s>  but the martins occupied
her thoughts a good deal </s>
<s>  she had spent two very happy months with them
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place </s>
<s>  emma encouraged her
talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of <abvr> martins having two parlours two very good
parlours indeed </s>
<s>  one of them quite as large as <abvr> goddards
drawingroom </s>
<s>  and of her having an upper maid who had lived
fiveandtwenty years with her </s>
<s>  and of their having eight cows two of
them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch
cow indeed </s>
<s>  and of <abvr> martins saying as she was so fond of it
it should be called her cow </s>
<s>  and of their having a very handsome
summerhouse in their garden where some day next year they were all to
drink tea </s>
<s> a very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen
people </s>
<s> 

for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate
cause </s>
<s>  but as she came to understand the family better other feelings
arose </s>
<s>  she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and
daughter a son and sons wife who all lived together </s>
<s>  but when it
appeared that the <abvr> martin who bore a part in the narrative and was
always mentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing
something or other was a single man </s>
<s>  that there was no young <abvr>
martin no wife in the case </s>
<s>  she did suspect danger to her poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not
taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever </s>
<s> 

with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and
meaning </s>
<s>  and she particularly led harriet to talk more of <abvr> martin
and there was evidently no dislike to it </s>
<s>  harriet was very ready to
speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening
games </s>
<s>  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured and
obliging </s>
<s>  he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her
some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in
every thing else he was so very obliging </s>
<s>  he had his shepherds son into
the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her </s>
<s>  she was very fond
of singing </s>
<s>  he could sing a little himself </s>
<s>  she believed he was very
clever and understood every thing </s>
<s>  he had a very fine flock and while
she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in
the country </s>
<s>  she believed every body spoke well of him </s>
<s>  his mother and
sisters were very fond of him </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin had told her one day and
there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he
would make a good husband </s>
<s>  not that she wanted him to marry </s>
<s>  she was
in no hurry at all </s>
<s> 

well done <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  thought emma </s>
<s>  you know what you are about </s>
<s> 

and when she had come away <abvr> martin was so very kind as to send
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose <abvr> goddard had ever
seen </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three
teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with
her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of
his own business </s>
<s>  he does not read </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> that is noi do not knowbut i believe he has read a
good dealbut not what you would think any thing of </s>
<s>  he reads the
agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window
seatsbut he reads all them to himself </s>
<s>  but sometimes of an evening
before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the
elegant extracts very entertaining </s>
<s>  and i know he has read the vicar of
wakefield </s>
<s>  he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of
the abbey </s>
<s>  he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but
he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can </s>
<s> 

the next question was

what sort of looking man is <abvr> martin </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  not handsomenot at all handsome </s>
<s>  i thought him very plain at
first but i do not think him so plain now </s>
<s>  one does not you know
after a time </s>
<s>  but did you never see him </s>
<s>  he is in highbury every now and
then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston </s>
<s> 
he has passed you very often </s>
<s> 

that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having
any idea of his name </s>
<s>  a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot
is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity </s>
<s>  the yeomanry are
precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do </s>
<s> 
a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me </s>
<s> 
i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other </s>
<s>  but
a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as
much above my notice as in every other he is below it </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  oh yes </s>
<s>  it is not likely you should ever have observed him </s>
<s> 
but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man </s>
<s>  i know
indeed that he is so and as such wish him well </s>
<s>  what do you imagine
his age to be </s>
<s> 

he was fourandtwenty the th of last june and my birthday is the
rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd </s>
<s> 

only fourandtwenty </s>
<s>  that is too young to settle </s>
<s>  his mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry </s>
<s>  they seem very comfortable as they
are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably
repent it </s>
<s>  six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young
woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very
desirable </s>
<s> 

six years hence </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old </s>
<s> 

well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not
born to an independence </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin i imagine has his fortune entirely
to makecannot be at all beforehand with the world </s>
<s>  whatever money he
might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family
property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and
so forth </s>
<s>  and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in
time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing
yet </s>
<s> 

to be sure so it is </s>
<s>  but they live very comfortably </s>
<s>  they have no
indoors man else they do not want for any thing </s>
<s>  and <abvr> martin talks
of taking a boy another year </s>
<s> 

i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does
marry </s>
<s> i mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though his
sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected
to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you
to notice </s>
<s>  the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates </s>
<s>  there can be no doubt of your being a
gentlemans daughter and you must support your claim to that station by
every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who
would take pleasure in degrading you </s>
<s> 

yes to be sure i suppose there are </s>
<s>  but while i visit at hartfield
and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any
body can do </s>
<s> 

you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet </s>
<s>  but i would
have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent
even of hartfield and miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i want to see you permanently
well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd
acquaintance as may be </s>
<s>  and therefore i say that if you should still
be in this country when <abvr> martin marries i wish you may not be drawn
in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife
who will probably be some mere farmers daughter without education </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  not that i think <abvr> martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some educationand been very well brought up </s>
<s>  however
i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i am sure i shall
not wish for the acquaintance of his wife </s>
<s>  i shall always have a great
regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very
sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me </s>
<s>  but
if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not
visit her if i can help it </s>
<s> 

emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no
alarming symptoms of love </s>
<s>  the young man had been the first admirer but
she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious
difficulty on harriets side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her
own </s>
<s> 

they met <abvr> martin the very next day as they were walking on the
donwell road </s>
<s>  he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at
her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion </s>
<s>  emma was
not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey </s>
<s>  and walking a few
yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye
sufficiently acquainted with <abvr> robert martin </s>
<s>  his appearance was very
neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no
other advantage </s>
<s>  and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen
she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriets
inclination </s>
<s>  harriet was not insensible of manner </s>
<s>  she had voluntarily
noticed her fathers gentleness with admiration as well as wonder </s>
<s>  <abvr>
martin looked as if he did not know what manner was </s>
<s> 

they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be
kept waiting </s>
<s>  and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face
and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to
compose </s>
<s> 

only think of our happening to meet him </s>
<s> how very odd </s>
<s>  it was quite
a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls </s>
<s>  he did not
think we ever walked this road </s>
<s>  he thought we walked towards randalls
most days </s>
<s>  he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet </s>
<s> 
he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it
but he goes again tomorrow </s>
<s>  so very odd we should happen to meet </s>
<s>  well
miss woodhouse is he like what you expected </s>
<s>  what do you think of him </s>
<s> 
do you think him so very plain </s>
<s> 

he is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plain </s>
<s> but that is nothing
compared with his entire want of gentility </s>
<s>  i had no right to expect
much and i did not expect much </s>
<s>  but i had no idea that he could be so
very clownish so totally without air </s>
<s>  i had imagined him i confess a
degree or two nearer gentility </s>
<s> 

to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel
as real gentlemen </s>
<s> 

i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you
must yourself be struck with the difference in <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  at hartfield
you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men </s>
<s>  i
should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company
with <abvr> martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior
creatureand rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him
at all agreeable before </s>
<s>  do not you begin to feel that now </s>
<s>  were not
you struck </s>
<s>  i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and
abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly
unmodulated as i stood here </s>
<s> 

certainly he is not like <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he has not such a fine air and
way of walking as <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i see the difference plain enough </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  knightley is so very fine a man </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to
compare <abvr> martin with him </s>
<s>  you might not see one in a hundred with
gentleman so plainly written as in <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  but he is not the
only gentleman you have been lately used to </s>
<s>  what say you to <abvr> weston
and <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  compare <abvr> martin with either of them </s>
<s>  compare their
manner of carrying themselves </s>
<s>  of walking </s>
<s>  of speaking </s>
<s>  of being silent </s>
<s> 
you must see the difference </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> there is a great difference </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston is almost an old
man </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston must be between forty and fifty </s>
<s> 

which makes his good manners the more valuable </s>
<s>  the older a person
grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not
be bad </s>
<s>  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or
awkwardness becomes </s>
<s>  what is passable in youth is detestable in later
age </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin is now awkward and abrupt </s>
<s>  what will he be at <abvr>
westons time of life </s>
<s> 

there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly </s>
<s> 

but there may be pretty good guessing </s>
<s>  he will be a completely gross
vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of
nothing but profit and loss </s>
<s> 

will he indeed </s>
<s>  that will be very bad </s>
<s> 

how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended </s>
<s> 
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
elsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man </s>
<s>  what has he to
do with books </s>
<s>  and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very
rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb
us </s>
<s> 

i wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer and
spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be
safely left to itself </s>
<s>  she therefore said no more for some time </s>
<s>  her
next beginning was

in one respect perhaps <abvr> eltons manners are superior to <abvr>
knightleys or <abvr> westons </s>
<s>  they have more gentleness </s>
<s>  they might be
more safely held up as a pattern </s>
<s>  there is an openness a quickness
almost a bluntness in <abvr> weston which every body likes in him
because there is so much goodhumour with itbut that would not do to
be copied </s>
<s>  neither would <abvr> knightleys downright decided commanding
sort of manner though it suits him very well </s>
<s>  his figure and look
and situation in life seem to allow it </s>
<s>  but if any young man were to set
about copying him he would not be sufferable </s>
<s>  on the contrary i think
a young man might be very safely recommended to take <abvr> elton as a
model </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle </s>
<s> 
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late </s>
<s>  i do not know
whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us
harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are
softer than they used to be </s>
<s>  if he means any thing it must be to please
you </s>
<s>  did not i tell you what he said of you the other day </s>
<s> 

she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from <abvr>
elton and now did full justice to </s>

said she had always thought <abvr> elton very agreeable </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young
farmer out of harriets head </s>
<s>  she thought it would be an excellent
match </s>
<s>  and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her
to have much merit in planning it </s>
<s>  she feared it was what every body
else must think of and predict </s>
<s>  it was not likely however that any
body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had
entered her brain during the very first evening of harriets coming to
hartfield </s>
<s>  the longer she considered it the greater was her sense
of its expediency </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons situation was most suitable quite the
gentleman himself and without low connexions </s>
<s>  at the same time not of
any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet </s>
<s> 
he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient
income </s>
<s>  for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known
to have some independent property </s>
<s>  and she thought very highly of him
as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man without any
deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world </s>
<s> 

she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful
girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was
foundation enough on his side </s>
<s>  and on harriets there could be little
doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual
weight and efficacy </s>

young man whom any woman not fastidious might like </s>

handsome </s>
<s>  his person much admired in general though not by her
there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense

chapter v


i do not know what your opinion may be <abvr> weston said <abvr>
knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i
think it a bad thing </s>
<s> 

a bad thing </s>
<s>  do you really think it a bad thing </s>
<s> why so </s>
<s> 

i think they will neither of them do the other any good </s>
<s> 

you surprize me </s>
<s>  emma must do harriet good </s>
<s>  and by supplying her with a
new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good </s>
<s>  i have been
seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure </s>
<s>  how very differently
we feel </s>
<s> not think they will do each other any good </s>
<s>  this will
certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> 

perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing
weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks
exactly as i do on the subject </s>
<s>  we were speaking of it only yesterday
and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a
girl in highbury for her to associate with </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley i shall not
allow you to be a fair judge in this case </s>
<s>  you are so much used to live
alone that you do not know the value of a companion </s>
<s>  and perhaps no
man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of
one of her own sex after being used to it all her life </s>
<s>  i can imagine
your objection to harriet smith </s>
<s>  she is not the superior young woman
which emmas friend ought to be </s>
<s>  but on the other hand as emma wants
to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more
herself </s>
<s>  they will read together </s>
<s>  she means it i know </s>
<s> 

emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old </s>
<s> 
i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at various times of
books that she meant to read regularly throughand very good lists
they werevery well chosen and very neatly arrangedsometimes
alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule </s>
<s>  the list she drew
up when only fourteeni remember thinking it did her judgment so much
credit that i preserved it some time </s>
<s>  and i dare say she may have made
out a very good list now </s>
<s>  but i have done with expecting any course of
steady reading from emma </s>
<s>  she will never submit to any thing
requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the
understanding </s>
<s>  where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely
affirm that harriet smith will do nothing </s>
<s> you never could persuade her
to read half so much as you wished </s>
<s> you know you could not </s>
<s> 

i dare say replied <abvr> weston smiling that i thought so
then </s>
<s> but since we have parted i can never remember emmas omitting
to do any thing i wished </s>
<s> 

there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid
mr </s>
<s>  knightley feelingly </s>
<s>  and for a moment or two he had done </s>
<s>  but i
 he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must
still see hear and remember </s>
<s>  emma is spoiled by being the cleverest
of her family </s>
<s>  at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to
answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen </s>
<s>  she was always
quick and assured </s>
<s>  isabella slow and diffident </s>
<s>  and ever since she
was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all </s>
<s>  in her
mother she lost the only person able to cope with her </s>
<s>  she inherits her
mothers talents and must have been under subjection to her </s>
<s> 

i should have been sorry <abvr> knightley to be dependent on your
recommendation had i quitted <abvr> woodhouses family and wanted another
situation </s>
<s>  i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to
any body </s>
<s>  i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held </s>
<s> 

yes said he smiling </s>
<s>  you are better placed here </s>
<s>  very fit for a
wife but not at all for a governess </s>
<s>  but you were preparing yourself to
be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield </s>
<s>  you might
not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to
promise </s>
<s>  but you were receiving a very good education from her on the
very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing
as you were bid </s>
<s>  and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i
should certainly have named miss taylor </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  there will be very little merit in making a good wife to
such a man as <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that
with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne </s>
<s>  we
will not despair however </s>
<s>  weston may grow cross from the wantonness of
comfort or his son may plague him </s>
<s> 

i hope not that </s>
<s> it is not likely </s>
<s>  no <abvr> knightley do not
foretell vexation from that quarter </s>
<s> 

not i indeed </s>
<s>  i only name possibilities </s>
<s>  i do not pretend to emmas
genius for foretelling and guessing </s>
<s>  i hope with all my heart the
young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune </s>
<s> but
harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith </s>
<s>  i think her the
very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have </s>
<s>  she knows
nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing </s>
<s>  she is a
flatterer in all her ways </s>
<s>  and so much the worse because undesigned </s>
<s> 
her ignorance is hourly flattery </s>
<s>  how can emma imagine she has any
thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful
inferiority </s>
<s>  and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot
gain by the acquaintance </s>
<s>  hartfield will only put her out of conceit
with all the other places she belongs to </s>
<s>  she will grow just refined
enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances
have placed her home </s>
<s>  i am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any
strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally
to the varieties of her situation in life </s>
<s> they only give a little
polish </s>
<s> 

i either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more
anxious for her present comfort </s>
<s>  for i cannot lament the acquaintance </s>
<s> 
how well she looked last night </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you </s>
<s>  very
well </s>
<s>  i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty </s>
<s> 

pretty </s>
<s>  say beautiful rather </s>
<s>  can you imagine any thing nearer perfect
beauty than emma altogetherface and figure </s>
<s> 

i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom
seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers </s>
<s>  but i am a partial
old friend </s>
<s> 

such an eye </s>
<s> the true hazle eyeand so brilliant </s>
<s>  regular features
open countenance with a complexion </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  what a bloom of full health
and such a pretty height and size </s>
<s>  such a firm and upright figure </s>
<s> 
there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her
glance </s>
<s>  one hears sometimes of a child being ˜the picture of health </s>
<s> 
now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of
grownup health </s>
<s>  she is loveliness itself </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley is not she </s>
<s> 

i have not a fault to find with her person he replied </s>
<s>  i think her
all you describe </s>
<s>  i love to look at her </s>
<s>  and i will add this praise
that i do not think her personally vain </s>
<s>  considering how very handsome
she is she appears to be little occupied with it </s>
<s>  her vanity lies
another way </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of
harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm </s>
<s> 

and i <abvr> knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not
doing them any harm </s>
<s>  with all dear emmas little faults she is an
excellent creature </s>
<s>  where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder
sister or a truer friend </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s>  she has qualities which may be
trusted </s>
<s>  she will never lead any one really wrong </s>
<s>  she will make no
lasting blunder </s>
<s>  where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred
times </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  i will not plague you any more </s>
<s>  emma shall be an angel and
i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella </s>
<s> 
john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection
and isabella always thinks as he does </s>
<s>  except when he is not quite
frightened enough about the children </s>
<s>  i am sure of having their opinions
with me </s>
<s> 

i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind </s>
<s> 
but excuse me <abvr> knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself
you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas
mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any
possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made a
matter of much discussion among you </s>
<s>  pray excuse me </s>
<s>  but supposing any
little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be
expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly
approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a
source of pleasure to herself </s>
<s>  it has been so many years my province to
give advice that you cannot be surprized <abvr> knightley at this little
remains of office </s>
<s> 

not at all cried he </s>
<s>  i am much obliged to you for it </s>
<s>  it is very
good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often
found </s>
<s>  for it shall be attended to </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about
her sister </s>
<s> 

be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry </s>
<s>  i will keep my
illhumour to myself </s>
<s>  i have a very sincere interest in emma </s>
<s>  isabella
does not seem more my sister </s>
<s>  has never excited a greater interest </s>
<s> 
perhaps hardly so great </s>
<s>  there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one
feels for emma </s>
<s>  i wonder what will become of her </s>
<s> 

so do i said <abvr> weston gently very much </s>
<s> 

she always declares she will never marry which of course means just
nothing at all </s>
<s>  but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she
cared for </s>
<s>  it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love
with a proper object </s>
<s>  i should like to see emma in love and in some
doubt of a return </s>
<s>  it would do her good </s>
<s>  but there is nobody hereabouts
to attach her </s>
<s>  and she goes so seldom from home </s>
<s> 

there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution
at present said <abvr> weston as can well be </s>
<s>  and while she is so
happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which
would be creating such difficulties on poor <abvr> woodhouses account </s>
<s>  i
do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight
to the state i assure you </s>
<s> 

part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own
and <abvr> westons on the subject as much as possible </s>
<s>  there were wishes
at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it was not desirable to
have them suspected </s>
<s>  and the quiet transition which <abvr> knightley soon
afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather </s>

rain </s>
<s>  convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about
hartfield </s>

chapter vi


emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy a proper
direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good
purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of <abvr>
eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners </s>
<s> 
and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his
admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating
as much liking on harriets side as there could be any occasion for </s>
<s> 
she was quite convinced of <abvr> eltons being in the fairest way of
falling in love if not in love already </s>
<s>  she had no scruple with regard
to him </s>
<s>  he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add </s>
<s>  his
perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner since her
introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of
his growing attachment </s>
<s> 

you have given miss smith all that she required said he </s>
<s>  you have
made her graceful and easy </s>
<s>  she was a beautiful creature when she
came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are
infinitely superior to what she received from nature </s>
<s> 

i am glad you think i have been useful to her </s>
<s>  but harriet only wanted
drawing out and receiving a few very few hints </s>
<s>  she had all the
natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself </s>
<s>  i have
done very little </s>
<s> 

if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant <abvr>
elton

i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have
taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before </s>
<s> 

exactly so </s>
<s>  that is what principally strikes me </s>
<s>  so much superadded
decision of character </s>
<s>  skilful has been the hand </s>
<s> 

great has been the pleasure i am sure </s>
<s>  i never met with a disposition
more truly amiable </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of it </s>
<s>  and it was spoken with a sort of sighing
animation which had a vast deal of the lover </s>
<s>  she was not less pleased
another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers
to have harriets picture </s>
<s> 

did you ever have your likeness taken harriet </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  did you
ever sit for your picture </s>
<s> 

harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say
with a very interesting naivete

oh </s>
<s>  dear no never </s>
<s> 

no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed

what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be </s>
<s>  i would
give any money for it </s>
<s>  i almost long to attempt her likeness myself </s>
<s> 
you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great
passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and
was thought to have a tolerable eye in general </s>
<s>  but from one cause or
another i gave it up in disgust </s>
<s>  but really i could almost venture
if harriet would sit to me </s>
<s>  it would be such a delight to have her
picture </s>
<s> 

let me entreat you cried <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  it would indeed be a delight </s>
<s> 
let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent
in favour of your friend </s>
<s>  i know what your drawings are </s>
<s>  how could
you suppose me ignorant </s>
<s>  is not this room rich in specimens of your
landscapes and flowers </s>
<s>  and has not <abvr> weston some inimitable
figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls </s>
<s> 

yes good man </s>
<s> thought emmabut what has all that to do with taking
likenesses </s>
<s>  you know nothing of drawing </s>
<s>  dont pretend to be in raptures
about mine </s>
<s>  keep your raptures for harriets face </s>
<s>  well if you give me
such kind encouragement <abvr> elton i believe i shall try what i can do </s>
<s> 
harriets features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult </s>
<s> 
and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines
about the mouth which one ought to catch </s>
<s> 

exactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi have
not a doubt of your success </s>
<s>  pray pray attempt it </s>
<s>  as you will do it
it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession </s>
<s> 

but i am afraid <abvr> elton harriet will not like to sit </s>
<s>  she thinks
so little of her own beauty </s>
<s>  did not you observe her manner of answering
me </s>
<s>  how completely it meant ˜why should my picture be drawn </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i observed it i assure you </s>
<s>  it was not lost on me </s>
<s>  but still
i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded </s>
<s> 

harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made </s>
<s> 
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the
earnest pressing of both the others </s>
<s>  emma wished to go to work directly
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at
portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might
decide together on the best size for harriet </s>
<s>  her many beginnings were
displayed </s>
<s>  miniatures halflengths wholelengths pencil crayon and
watercolours had been all tried in turn </s>
<s>  she had always wanted to do
every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than
many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to </s>
<s> 
she played and sang </s>
<s> and drew in almost every style </s>
<s>  but steadiness
had always been wanting </s>
<s>  and in nothing had she approached the degree of
excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to
have failed of </s>
<s>  she was not much deceived as to her own skill either
as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others
deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often
higher than it deserved </s>
<s> 

there was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the
most </s>
<s>  her style was spirited </s>
<s>  but had there been much less or had there
been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions
would have been the same </s>
<s>  they were both in ecstasies </s>
<s>  a likeness
pleases every body </s>
<s>  and miss woodhouses performances must be capital </s>
<s> 

no great variety of faces for you said emma </s>
<s>  i had only my own
family to study from </s>
<s>  there is my fatheranother of my fatherbut the
idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only
take him by stealth </s>
<s>  neither of them very like therefore </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
again and again and again you see </s>
<s>  dear <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  always my
kindest friend on every occasion </s>
<s>  she would sit whenever i asked her </s>
<s> 
there is my sister </s>
<s>  and really quite her own little elegant figure </s>
<s> and
the face not unlike </s>
<s>  i should have made a good likeness of her if she
would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw
her four children that she would not be quiet </s>
<s>  then here come all my
attempts at three of those four children </s>
<s> there they are henry and
john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of
them might do for any one of the rest </s>
<s>  she was so eager to have them
drawn that i could not refuse </s>
<s>  but there is no making children of three
or four years old stand still you know </s>
<s>  nor can it be very easy to take
any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are
coarser featured than any of mamas children ever were </s>
<s>  here is my
sketch of the fourth who was a baby </s>
<s>  i took him as he was sleeping on
the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would
wish to see </s>
<s>  he had nestled down his head most conveniently </s>
<s>  thats very
like </s>
<s>  i am rather proud of little george </s>
<s>  the corner of the sofa is very
good </s>
<s>  then here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother <abvr> john
knightley </s>
<s> this did not want much of being finished when i put it away
in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness </s>
<s>  i could not
help being provoked </s>
<s>  for after all my pains and when i had really made
a very good likeness of itmrs </s>
<s>  weston and i were quite agreed in
thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo flatteringbut
that was a fault on the right sideafter all this came poor dear
isabellas cold approbation ofyes it was a little likebut to be
sure it did not do him justice </s>
<s>  we had had a great deal of trouble
in persuading him to sit at all </s>
<s>  it was made a great favour of </s>
<s>  and
altogether it was more than i could bear </s>
<s>  and so i never would finish
it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every
morning visitor in brunswick square </s>
<s> and as i said i did then
forswear ever drawing any body again </s>
<s>  but for harriets sake or rather
for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at
present i will break my resolution now </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was
repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as
you observe </s>
<s>  exactly so </s>
<s>  no husbands and wives with so interesting a
consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better
leave them together at once </s>
<s>  but as she wanted to be drawing the
declaration must wait a little longer </s>
<s> 

she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait </s>
<s>  it was to be
a wholelength in watercolours like <abvr> john knightleys and was
destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station
over the mantelpiece </s>
<s> 

the sitting began </s>
<s>  and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not
keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of
youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist </s>
<s>  but there was no
doing any thing with <abvr> elton fidgeting behind her and watching every
touch </s>
<s>  she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze
and gaze again without offence </s>
<s>  but was really obliged to put an end to
it and request him to place himself elsewhere </s>
<s>  it then occurred to her
to employ him in reading </s>
<s> 

if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness
indeed </s>
<s>  it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the
irksomeness of miss smiths </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was only too happy </s>
<s>  harriet listened and emma drew in peace </s>
<s> 
she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look </s>
<s>  any thing less
would certainly have been too little in a lover </s>
<s>  and he was ready at the
smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress
and be charmed </s>
<s> there was no being displeased with such an encourager
for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it
was possible </s>
<s>  she could not respect his eye but his love and his
complaisance were unexceptionable </s>
<s> 

the sitting was altogether very satisfactory </s>
<s>  she was quite enough
pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on </s>
<s>  there was no want
of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant
to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more
height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of
its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling
its destined place with credit to them botha standing memorial of the
beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both </s>
<s> 
with as many other agreeable associations as <abvr> eltons very promising
attachment was likely to add </s>
<s> 

harriet was to sit again the next day </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton just as he ought
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again </s>
<s> 

by all means </s>
<s>  we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the
party </s>
<s> 

the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction
took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the
picture which was rapid and happy </s>
<s>  every body who saw it was pleased
but <abvr> elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every
criticism </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she
wantedobserved <abvr> weston to himnot in the least suspecting that
she was addressing a lover </s>
<s> the expression of the eye is most correct
but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes </s>
<s>  it is the fault of
her face that she has them not </s>
<s> 

do you think so </s>
<s>  replied he </s>
<s>  i cannot agree with you </s>
<s>  it appears
to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature </s>
<s>  i never saw such a
likeness in my life </s>
<s>  we must allow for the effect of shade you know </s>
<s> 

you have made her too tall emma said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 

emma knew that she had but would not own it </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton warmly
added

oh no </s>
<s>  certainly not too tall </s>
<s>  not in the least too tall </s>
<s>  consider she
is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich in short
gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must be preserved you know </s>
<s> 
proportions foreshortening </s>
<s> oh no </s>
<s>  it gives one exactly the idea of
such a height as miss smiths </s>
<s>  exactly so indeed </s>
<s> 

it is very pretty said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  so prettily done </s>
<s>  just as your
drawings always are my dear </s>
<s>  i do not know any body who draws so well
as you do </s>
<s>  the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems
to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her
shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold </s>
<s> 

but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer </s>
<s>  a warm day in summer </s>
<s> 
look at the tree </s>
<s> 

but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear </s>
<s> 

you sir may say any thing cried <abvr> elton but i must confess that
i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of
doors </s>
<s>  and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit </s>
<s>  any other
situation would have been much less in character </s>
<s>  the naivete of miss
smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is most admirable </s>
<s>  i cannot keep
my eyes from it </s>
<s>  i never saw such a likeness </s>
<s> 

the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed </s>
<s>  and here were a few
difficulties </s>
<s>  it must be done directly </s>
<s>  it must be done in london </s>
<s>  the
order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on </s>
<s>  and isabella the usual doer of all commissions
must not be applied to because it was december and <abvr> woodhouse

mr </s>

it </s>

chapter vii


the very day of <abvr> eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion
for emmas services towards her friend </s>
<s>  harriet had been at hartfield
as usual soon after breakfast </s>
<s>  and after a time had gone home to
return again to dinner </s>
<s>  she returned and sooner than had been
talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell </s>
<s>  half a
minute brought it all out </s>
<s>  she had heard as soon as she got back to
mrs </s>
<s>  goddards that <abvr> martin had been there an hour before and
finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a
little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away </s>
<s>  and on
opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which
she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself </s>
<s>  and this letter was
from him from <abvr> martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage </s>
<s> 
who could have thought it </s>
<s>  she was so surprized she did not know what
to do </s>
<s>  yes quite a proposal of marriage </s>
<s>  and a very good letter
at least she thought so </s>
<s>  and he wrote as if he really loved her very
muchbut she did not knowand so she was come as fast as she could to
ask miss woodhouse what she should do </s>
<s>  emma was halfashamed of her
friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful </s>
<s> 

upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any
thing for want of asking </s>
<s>  he will connect himself well if he can </s>
<s> 

will you read the letter </s>
<s>  cried harriet </s>
<s>  pray do </s>
<s>  id rather you
would </s>
<s> 

emma was not sorry to be pressed </s>
<s>  she read and was surprized </s>
<s>  the style
of the letter was much above her expectation </s>
<s>  there were not merely no
grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a
gentleman </s>
<s>  the language though plain was strong and unaffected and
the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer </s>
<s>  it was
short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety
even delicacy of feeling </s>
<s>  she paused over it while harriet stood
anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last
forced to add is it a good letter </s>
<s>  or is it too short </s>
<s> 

yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso
good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his
sisters must have helped him </s>
<s>  i can hardly imagine the young man whom
i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if
left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman </s>
<s> 
no certainly it is too strong and concise </s>
<s>  not diffuse enough for a
woman </s>
<s>  no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural
talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in
hand his thoughts naturally find proper words </s>
<s>  it is so with some men </s>
<s> 
yes i understand the sort of mind </s>
<s>  vigorous decided with sentiments
to a certain point not coarse </s>
<s>  a better written letter harriet
returning it than i had expected </s>
<s> 

well said the still waiting harriet </s>
<s> wellandand what shall i
do </s>
<s> 

what shall you do </s>
<s>  in what respect </s>
<s>  do you mean with regard to this
letter </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

but what are you in doubt of </s>
<s>  you must answer it of courseand
speedily </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but what shall i say </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse do advise me </s>
<s> 

oh no no </s>
<s>  the letter had much better be all your own </s>
<s>  you will express
yourself very properly i am sure </s>
<s>  there is no danger of your not
being intelligible which is the first thing </s>
<s>  your meaning must be
unequivocal </s>
<s>  no doubts or demurs </s>
<s>  and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will
present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded </s>
<s>  you need
not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his
disappointment </s>
<s> 

you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down </s>
<s> 

ought to refuse him </s>
<s>  my dear harriet what do you mean </s>
<s>  are you in any
doubt as to that </s>
<s>  i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i have been
under a mistake </s>
<s>  i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel
in doubt as to the purport of your answer </s>
<s>  i had imagined you were
consulting me only as to the wording of it </s>
<s> 

harriet was silent </s>
<s>  with a little reserve of manner emma continued </s>
<s> 

you mean to return a favourable answer i collect </s>
<s> 

no i do not </s>
<s>  that is i do not meanwhat shall i do </s>
<s>  what would you
advise me to do </s>
<s>  pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do </s>
<s> 

i shall not give you any advice harriet </s>
<s>  i will have nothing to do
with it </s>
<s>  this is a point which you must settle with your feelings </s>
<s> 

i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet
contemplating the letter </s>
<s>  for a little while emma persevered in her
silence </s>
<s>  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say

i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as
to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse
him </s>
<s>  if she can hesitate as to ˜yes she ought to say ˜no directly </s>
<s> 
it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with
half a heart </s>
<s>  i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself
to say thus much to you </s>
<s>  but do not imagine that i want to influence
you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would
just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean thatas
you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should not be
hesitatingit is a very serious thing </s>
<s> it will be safer to say ˜no
perhaps </s>
<s> do you think i had better say ˜no </s>
<s> 

not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you
either way </s>
<s>  you must be the best judge of your own happiness </s>
<s>  if you
prefer <abvr> martin to every other person </s>
<s>  if you think him the most
agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you
hesitate </s>
<s>  you blush harriet </s>
<s> does any body else occur to you at
this moment under such a definition </s>
<s>  harriet harriet do not deceive
yourself </s>
<s>  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion </s>
<s>  at this
moment whom are you thinking of </s>
<s> 

the symptoms were favourable </s>
<s> instead of answering harriet turned away
confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire </s>
<s>  and though the letter was
still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard </s>
<s> 
emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes </s>
<s>  at
last with some hesitation harriet said

miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well
as i can by myself </s>
<s>  and i have now quite determined and really almost
made up my mindto refuse <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  do you think i am right </s>
<s> 

perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet </s>
<s>  you are doing just
what you ought </s>
<s>  while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to
myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation
in approving </s>
<s>  dear harriet i give myself joy of this </s>
<s>  it would
have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the
consequence of your marrying <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  while you were in the smallest
degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence </s>
<s> 
but it would have been the loss of a friend to me </s>
<s>  i could not have
visited <abvr> robert martin of abbeymill farm </s>
<s>  now i am secure of you
for ever </s>
<s> 

harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her
forcibly </s>
<s> 

you could not have visited me </s>
<s>  she cried looking aghast </s>
<s>  no to be
sure you could not </s>
<s>  but i never thought of that before </s>
<s>  that would have
been too dreadful </s>
<s> what an escape </s>
<s> dear miss woodhouse i would not
give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing
in the world </s>
<s> 

indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you </s>
<s>  but it
must have been </s>
<s>  you would have thrown yourself out of all good society </s>
<s> 
i must have given you up </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s> how should i ever have borne it </s>
<s>  it would have killed me
never to come to hartfield any more </s>
<s> 

dear affectionate creature </s>
<s> you banished to abbeymill farm </s>
<s> you
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life </s>
<s>  i
wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it </s>
<s>  he must
have a pretty good opinion of himself </s>
<s> 

i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her
conscience opposing such censure </s>
<s>  at least he is very good natured
and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard
forbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know though
he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand certainly i must
confess that since my visiting here i have seen peopleand if one comes
to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all
one is so very handsome and agreeable </s>
<s>  however i do really think <abvr>
martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him </s>
<s>  and
his being so much attached to meand his writing such a letterbut as
to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you my own sweet little friend </s>
<s>  we will not be
parted </s>
<s>  a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or
because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s> and it is but a short letter too </s>
<s> 

emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very
true </s>
<s>  and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish
manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that
her husband could write a good letter </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes very </s>
<s>  nobody cares for a letter </s>
<s>  the thing is to be always
happy with pleasant companions </s>
<s>  i am quite determined to refuse him </s>
<s>  but
how shall i do </s>
<s>  what shall i say </s>
<s> 

emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised
its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her
assistance </s>
<s>  and though emma continued to protest against any assistance
being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence </s>
<s> 
the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a
softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up
with a few decisive expressions </s>
<s>  and she was so very much concerned at
the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother
and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not
fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in
her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all </s>
<s> 

this letter however was written and sealed and sent </s>
<s>  the business
was finished and harriet safe </s>
<s>  she was rather low all the evening but
emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by
speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of
mr </s>
<s>  elton </s>
<s> 

i shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather a
sorrowful tone </s>
<s> 

nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet </s>
<s>  you
are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbeymill </s>
<s> 

and i am sure i should never want to go there </s>
<s>  for i am never happy but
at hartfield </s>
<s> 

some time afterwards it was i think <abvr> goddard would be very much
surprized if she knew what had happened </s>
<s>  i am sure miss nash wouldfor
miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a
linendraper </s>
<s> 

one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher
of a school harriet </s>
<s>  i dare say miss nash would envy you such an
opportunity as this of being married </s>
<s>  even this conquest would appear
valuable in her eyes </s>
<s>  as to any thing superior for you i suppose she
is quite in the dark </s>
<s>  the attentions of a certain person can hardly be
among the tittletattle of highbury yet </s>
<s>  hitherto i fancy you and i
are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained
themselves </s>
<s> 

harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that
people should like her so much </s>
<s>  the idea of <abvr> elton was certainly
cheering </s>
<s>  but still after a time she was tenderhearted again towards
the rejected <abvr> martin </s>
<s> 

now he has got my letter said she softly </s>
<s>  i wonder what they are all
doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy they will be unhappy
too </s>
<s>  i hope he will not mind it so very much </s>
<s> 

let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
employed cried emma </s>
<s>  at this moment perhaps <abvr> elton is shewing
your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful
is the original and after being asked for it five or six times
allowing them to hear your name your own dear name </s>
<s> 

my picture </s>
<s> but he has left my picture in bondstreet </s>
<s> 

has he so </s>
<s> then i know nothing of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  no my dear little modest
harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bondstreet till
just before he mounts his horse tomorrow </s>
<s>  it is his companion all this
evening his solace his delight </s>
<s>  it opens his designs to his family
it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those
pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm
prepossession </s>
<s>  how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy
their imaginations all are </s>
<s> 

harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger </s>
<s> 



chapter viii


harriet slept at hartfield that night </s>
<s>  for some weeks past she had been
spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have
a bedroom appropriated to herself </s>
<s>  and emma judged it best in every
respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible
just at present </s>
<s>  she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or
two to <abvr> goddards but it was then to be settled that she should
return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days </s>
<s> 

while she was gone <abvr> knightley called and sat some time with <abvr>
woodhouse and emma till <abvr> woodhouse who had previously made up his
mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was
induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his
own civility to leave <abvr> knightley for that purpose </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley
who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short
decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and
civil hesitations of the other </s>
<s> 

well i believe if you will excuse me <abvr> knightley if you will not
consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emmas advice and
go out for a quarter of an hour </s>
<s>  as the sun is out i believe i had
better take my three turns while i can </s>
<s>  i treat you without ceremony
mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  we invalids think we are privileged people </s>
<s> 

my dear sir do not make a stranger of me </s>
<s> 

i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter </s>
<s>  emma will be happy to
entertain you </s>
<s>  and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my
three turnsmy winter walk </s>
<s> 

you cannot do better sir </s>
<s> 

i would ask for the pleasure of your company <abvr> knightley but i am a
very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you </s>
<s>  and besides you
have another long walk before you to donwell abbey </s>
<s> 

thank you sir thank you </s>
<s>  i am going this moment myself </s>
<s>  and i think
the sooner you go the better </s>
<s>  i will fetch your greatcoat and open the
garden door for you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse at last was off </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley instead of being
immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more
chat </s>
<s>  he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more
voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before </s>
<s> 

i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he </s>
<s>  but she is a
pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her
disposition </s>
<s>  her character depends upon those she is with </s>
<s>  but in good
hands she will turn out a valuable woman </s>
<s> 

i am glad you think so </s>
<s>  and the good hands i hope may not be
wanting </s>
<s> 

come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you
that you have improved her </s>
<s>  you have cured her of her schoolgirls
giggle </s>
<s>  she really does you credit </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been
of some use </s>
<s>  but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they
may </s>
<s>  you do not often overpower me with it </s>
<s> 

you are expecting her again you say this morning </s>
<s> 

almost every moment </s>
<s>  she has been gone longer already than she
intended </s>
<s> 

something has happened to delay her </s>
<s>  some visitors perhaps </s>
<s> 

highbury gossips </s>
<s> tiresome wretches </s>
<s> 

harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would </s>
<s> 

emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said
nothing </s>
<s>  he presently added with a smile

i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that
i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of
something to her advantage </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  how so </s>
<s>  of what sort </s>
<s> 

a very serious sort i assure you </s>
<s>  still smiling </s>
<s> 

very serious </s>
<s>  i can think of but one thingwho is in love with her </s>
<s> 
who makes you their confidant </s>
<s> 

emma was more than half in hopes of <abvr> eltons having dropt a hint </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew <abvr>
elton looked up to him </s>
<s> 

i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have
an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter </s>
<s> robert
martin is the man </s>
<s>  her visit to abbeymill this summer seems to have
done his business </s>
<s>  he is desperately in love and means to marry her </s>
<s> 

he is very obliging said emma </s>
<s>  but is he sure that harriet means to
marry him </s>
<s> 

well well means to make her an offer then </s>
<s>  will that do </s>
<s>  he came to
the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it </s>
<s>  he knows
i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe
considers me as one of his best friends </s>
<s>  he came to ask me whether
i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early </s>
<s>  whether
i thought her too young </s>
<s>  in short whether i approved his choice
altogether </s>
<s>  having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered
especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society
above him </s>
<s>  i was very much pleased with all that he said </s>
<s>  i never hear
better sense from any one than robert martin </s>
<s>  he always speaks to the
purpose </s>
<s>  open straightforward and very well judging </s>
<s>  he told me every
thing </s>
<s>  his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in
the event of his marriage </s>
<s>  he is an excellent young man both as son and
brother </s>
<s>  i had no hesitation in advising him to marry </s>
<s>  he proved to me
that he could afford it </s>
<s>  and that being the case i was convinced he
could not do better </s>
<s>  i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent
him away very happy </s>
<s>  if he had never esteemed my opinion before he
would have thought highly of me then </s>
<s>  and i dare say left the house
thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had </s>
<s>  this happened
the night before last </s>
<s>  now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear
to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at <abvr>
goddards today </s>
<s>  and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking
him at all a tiresome wretch </s>
<s> 

pray <abvr> knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech how do you know that <abvr> martin
did not speak yesterday </s>
<s> 

certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it </s>
<s>  but it
may be inferred </s>
<s>  was not she the whole day with you </s>
<s> 

come said she i will tell you something in return for what
you have told me </s>
<s>  he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote and was
refused </s>
<s> 

this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood
up in tall indignation and said

then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her </s>
<s>  what is the
foolish girl about </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man
that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage </s>
<s>  a man always
imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her </s>
<s> 

nonsense </s>
<s>  a man does not imagine any such thing </s>
<s>  but what is the
meaning of this </s>
<s>  harriet smith refuse robert martin </s>
<s>  madness if it is
so </s>
<s>  but i hope you are mistaken </s>
<s> 

i saw her answer </s>
<s> nothing could be clearer </s>
<s> 

you saw her answer </s>
<s> you wrote her answer too </s>
<s>  emma this is your
doing </s>
<s>  you persuaded her to refuse him </s>
<s> 

and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not
feel that i had done wrong </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin is a very respectable young man
but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal </s>
<s>  and am rather surprized
indeed that he should have ventured to address her </s>
<s>  by your account he
does seem to have had some scruples </s>
<s>  it is a pity that they were ever
got over </s>
<s> 

not harriets equal </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> knightley loudly and warmly </s>
<s>  and
with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is
not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in
situation </s>
<s>  emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you </s>
<s>  what are
harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education to any
connexion higher than robert martin </s>
<s>  she is the natural daughter of
nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and
certainly no respectable relations </s>
<s>  she is known only as parlourboarder
at a common school </s>
<s>  she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any
information </s>
<s>  she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and
too simple to have acquired any thing herself </s>
<s>  at her age she can have
no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have
any that can avail her </s>
<s>  she is pretty and she is good tempered and
that is all </s>
<s>  my only scruple in advising the match was on his account
as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him </s>
<s>  i felt that
as to fortune in all probability he might do much better </s>
<s>  and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse </s>
<s>  but i
could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there
being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in
good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well </s>
<s> 
the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side </s>
<s>  and had not the
smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cryout
upon her extreme good luck </s>
<s>  even your satisfaction i made sure of </s>
<s> 
it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friends
leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well </s>
<s>  i remember
saying to myself ˜even emma with all her partiality for harriet will
think this a good match </s>
<s> 

i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any
such thing </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s>  think a farmer and with all his sense and all his
merit <abvr> martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend </s>
<s> 
not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom
i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own </s>
<s>  i wonder you should
think it possible for me to have such feelings </s>
<s>  i assure you mine are
very different </s>
<s>  i must think your statement by no means fair </s>
<s>  you are
not just to harriets claims </s>
<s>  they would be estimated very differently
by others as well as myself </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin may be the richest of the two
but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society </s>
<s> the sphere in
which she moves is much above his </s>
<s> it would be a degradation </s>
<s> 

a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a
respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer </s>
<s> 

as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may
be called nobody it will not hold in common sense </s>
<s>  she is not to pay
for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with
whom she is brought up </s>
<s> there can scarcely be a doubt that her father
is a gentlemanand a gentleman of fortune </s>
<s> her allowance is
very liberal </s>
<s>  nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or
comfort </s>
<s> that she is a gentlemans daughter is indubitable to me </s>
<s>  that
she associates with gentlemens daughters no one i apprehend will
deny </s>
<s> she is superior to <abvr> robert martin </s>
<s> 

whoever might be her parents said <abvr> knightley whoever may have
had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of
their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society </s>
<s>  after
receiving a very indifferent education she is left in <abvr> goddards
hands to shift as she can </s>
<s> to move in short in <abvr> goddards line
to have <abvr> goddards acquaintance </s>
<s>  her friends evidently thought
this good enough for her </s>
<s>  and it was good enough </s>
<s>  she desired nothing
better herself </s>
<s>  till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had
no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it </s>
<s>  she was as
happy as possible with the martins in the summer </s>
<s>  she had no sense of
superiority then </s>
<s>  if she has it now you have given it </s>
<s>  you have been no
friend to harriet smith emma </s>
<s>  robert martin would never have proceeded
so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to
him </s>
<s>  i know him well </s>
<s>  he has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion </s>
<s>  and as to conceit he is
the farthest from it of any man i know </s>
<s>  depend upon it he had
encouragement </s>
<s> 

it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion </s>
<s>  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject
again </s>
<s> 

you are a very warm friend to <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  but as i said before
are unjust to harriet </s>
<s>  harriets claims to marry well are not so
contemptible as you represent them </s>
<s>  she is not a clever girl but she
has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her
understanding spoken of so slightingly </s>
<s>  waiving that point however and
supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and goodnatured
let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not
trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a
beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an
hundred </s>
<s>  and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the
subject of beauty than they are generally supposed </s>
<s>  till they do fall
in love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with
such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought
after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a
claim to be nice </s>
<s>  her goodnature too is not so very slight a claim
comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and
manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to
be pleased with other people </s>
<s>  i am very much mistaken if your sex in
general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims
a woman could possess </s>
<s> 

upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost
enough to make me think so too </s>
<s>  better be without sense than misapply
it as you do </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  cried she playfully </s>
<s>  i know that is the feeling of
you all </s>
<s>  i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every
man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his
judgment </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  harriet may pick and chuse </s>
<s>  were you yourself ever to
marry she is the very woman for you </s>
<s>  and is she at seventeen just
entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at
because she does not accept the first offer she receives </s>
<s>  nopray let
her have time to look about her </s>
<s> 

i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said <abvr> knightley
presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself </s>
<s>  but i now perceive
that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet </s>
<s>  you will puff her up
with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that
in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her </s>
<s> 
vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief </s>
<s>  nothing
so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high </s>
<s>  miss
harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though
she is a very pretty girl </s>
<s>  men of sense whatever you may chuse to
say do not want silly wives </s>
<s>  men of family would not be very fond of
connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent
men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be
involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed </s>
<s>  let
her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for
ever </s>
<s>  but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her
to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large
fortune she may be a parlourboarder at <abvr> goddards all the rest
of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry
somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the
old writingmasters son </s>
<s> 

we think so very differently on this point <abvr> knightley that there
can be no use in canvassing it </s>
<s>  we shall only be making each other more
angry </s>
<s>  but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible </s>
<s> 
she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any
second application </s>
<s>  she must abide by the evil of having refused him
whatever it may be </s>
<s>  and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to
say that i might not influence her a little </s>
<s>  but i assure you there
was very little for me or for any body to do </s>
<s>  his appearance is so much
against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to
favour him she is not now </s>
<s>  i can imagine that before she had seen
any body superior she might tolerate him </s>
<s>  he was the brother of her
friends and he took pains to please her </s>
<s>  and altogether having seen
nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not
while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable </s>
<s>  but the case
is altered now </s>
<s>  she knows now what gentlemen are </s>
<s>  and nothing but a
gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet </s>
<s> 

nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked </s>
<s>  cried <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> robert martins manners have sense sincerity and
goodhumour to recommend them </s>
<s>  and his mind has more true gentility than
harriet smith could understand </s>
<s> 

emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone </s>
<s>  she
did not repent what she had done </s>
<s>  she still thought herself a better
judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be </s>
<s> 
but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general
which made her dislike having it so loudly against her </s>
<s>  and to have him
sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable </s>
<s> 
some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt
on emmas side to talk of the weather but he made no answer </s>
<s>  he was
thinking </s>
<s>  the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words </s>
<s> 

robert martin has no great lossif he can but think so </s>
<s>  and i hope it
will not be long before he does </s>
<s>  your views for harriet are best known
to yourself </s>
<s>  but as you make no secret of your love of matchmaking it
is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have </s>
<s> and as
a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it
will be all labour in vain </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and disclaimed </s>
<s>  he continued

depend upon it elton will not do </s>
<s>  elton is a very good sort of man
and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make
an imprudent match </s>
<s>  he knows the value of a good income as well as any
body </s>
<s>  elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally </s>
<s>  he is
as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriets </s>
<s> 
he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite
wherever he goes </s>
<s>  and from his general way of talking in unreserved
moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does
not mean to throw himself away </s>
<s>  i have heard him speak with great
animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are
intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece </s>
<s> 

i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again </s>
<s>  if i had
set my heart on <abvr> eltons marrying harriet it would have been very
kind to open my eyes </s>
<s>  but at present i only want to keep harriet to
myself </s>
<s>  i have done with matchmaking indeed </s>
<s>  i could never hope to
equal my own doings at randalls </s>
<s>  i shall leave off while i am well </s>
<s> 

good morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly </s>
<s>  he was
very much vexed </s>
<s>  he felt the disappointment of the young man and was
mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had
given </s>
<s>  and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair
was provoking him exceedingly </s>
<s> 

emma remained in a state of vexation too </s>
<s>  but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of hers than in his </s>
<s>  she did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that
her opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he
walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her </s>
<s>  she
was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and
the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives </s>
<s>  harriets staying
away so long was beginning to make her uneasy </s>
<s>  the possibility of the
young mans coming to <abvr> goddards that morning and meeting with
harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas </s>
<s>  the dread
of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness </s>
<s>  and when
harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any
such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which
settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let <abvr>
knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which womans
friendship and womans feelings would not justify </s>
<s> 

he had frightened her a little about <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  but when she considered
that <abvr> knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither
with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such
a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she
was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully
to be true than what he knew any thing about </s>
<s>  he certainly might have
heard <abvr> elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and
mr </s>
<s>  elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to
money matters </s>
<s>  he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise
to them </s>
<s>  but then <abvr> knightley did not make due allowance for the
influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its
effects </s>
<s>  but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming
any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest </s>
<s>  and
more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure
did not belong to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

harriets cheerful look and manner established hers </s>
<s>  she came back not
to think of <abvr> martin but to talk of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  miss nash had been
telling her something which she repeated immediately with great
delight </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry had been to <abvr> goddards to attend a sick child
and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was
coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met <abvr> elton and
found to his great surprize that <abvr> elton was actually on his road
to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the
whistclub night which he had been never known to miss before </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it
was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to
persuade him to put off his journey only one day </s>
<s>  but it would not
do </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very
particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would
not put off for any inducement in the world </s>
<s>  and something about a
very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly
precious </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure
there must be a lady in the case and he told him so </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton
only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits </s>
<s> 
miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about
mr </s>
<s>  elton </s>
<s>  and said looking so very significantly at her that she did
not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only
knew that any woman whom <abvr> elton could prefer she should think the
luckiest woman in the world </s>
<s>  for beyond a doubt <abvr> elton had not his
equal for beauty or agreeableness </s>

chapter ix


mr </s>
<s>  knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with
herself </s>
<s>  he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before
he came to hartfield again </s>
<s>  and when they did meet his grave looks
shewed that she was not forgiven </s>
<s>  she was sorry but could not repent </s>
<s> 
on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified
and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days </s>
<s> 

the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after <abvr>
eltons return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
sittingroom he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences
of admiration just as he ought </s>
<s>  and as for harriets feelings they were
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as
her youth and sort of mind admitted </s>
<s>  emma was soon perfectly satisfied
of <abvr> martins being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a
contrast with <abvr> elton of the utmost advantage to the latter </s>
<s> 

her views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal of
useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few
first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow </s>
<s>  it was much
easier to chat than to study </s>
<s>  much pleasanter to let her imagination
range and work at harriets fortune than to be labouring to enlarge
her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts </s>
<s>  and the only literary
pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she
was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing
all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin
quarto of hotpressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with
ciphers and trophies </s>
<s> 

in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are
not uncommon </s>
<s>  miss nash headteacher at <abvr> goddards had written out
at least three hundred </s>
<s>  and harriet who had taken the first hint of it
from her hoped with miss woodhouses help to get a great many more </s>
<s> 
emma assisted with her invention memory and taste </s>
<s>  and as harriet wrote
a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first
order in form as well as quantity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the
girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting
in </s>
<s>  so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe
wondered he could not remember them </s>
<s>  but he hoped he should in time </s>
<s> 
 and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid </s>
<s> 

his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind </s>
<s>  but he
had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much
something he thought might come from that quarter </s>
<s> 

it was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of highbury
in general should be put under requisition </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was the only one
whose assistance she asked </s>
<s>  he was invited to contribute any really good
enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect </s>
<s>  and she had
the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections </s>
<s> 
and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that
nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the
sex should pass his lips </s>
<s>  they owed to him their two or three politest
puzzles </s>
<s>  and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and
rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade

    my first doth affliction denote
      which my second is destind to feel
    and my whole is the best antidote
      that affliction to soften and heal </s>
<s> 

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some
pages ago already </s>
<s> 

why will not you write one yourself for us <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  that
is the only security for its freshness </s>
<s>  and nothing could be easier to
you </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his
life </s>
<s>  the stupidest fellow </s>
<s>  he was afraid not even miss woodhousehe
stopt a momentor miss smith could inspire him </s>
<s> 

the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration </s>
<s>  he
called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table
containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed
to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his
manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own </s>
<s> 

i do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he </s>
<s>  being my
friends i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye
but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it </s>
<s> 

the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could
understand </s>
<s>  there was deep consciousness about him and he found
it easier to meet her eye than her friends </s>
<s>  he was gone the next
moment </s>
<s> after another moments pause

take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards
harrietit is for you </s>
<s>  take your own </s>
<s> 

but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it </s>
<s>  and emma never
loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself </s>

she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through
again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then
passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while
harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and
dulness very well <abvr> elton very well indeed </s>

now </s>
<s> 

she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the
eagerness of harriets wondering questions </s>

<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss
woodhouse what can we do about that </s>
<s> 

leave it to me </s>
<s>  you do nothing </s>
<s>  he will be here this evening i dare
say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will
pass between us and you shall not be committed </s>
<s> your soft eyes shall
chuse their own time for beaming </s>
<s>  trust to me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful
charade into my book </s>
<s>  i am sure i have not got one half so good </s>
<s> 

leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not
write it into your book </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but those two lines are

the best of all </s>
<s>  granted </s>
<s> for private enjoyment </s>
<s>  and for private
enjoyment keep them </s>
<s>  they are not at all the less written you know
because you divide them </s>
<s>  the couplet does not cease to be nor does its
meaning change </s>
<s>  but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a
very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection </s>
<s>  depend upon
it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his
passion </s>
<s>  a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or
neither </s>
<s>  give me the book i will write it down and then there can be
no possible reflection on you </s>
<s> 

harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a
declaration of love </s>
<s>  it seemed too precious an offering for any degree
of publicity </s>
<s> 

i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she </s>
<s> 

very well replied emma </s>
<s>  a most natural feeling </s>
<s>  and the longer it
lasts the better i shall be pleased </s>
<s>  but here is my father coming </s>
<s>  you
will not object to my reading the charade to him </s>
<s>  it will be giving him
so much pleasure </s>
<s>  he loves any thing of the sort and especially any
thing that pays woman a compliment </s>
<s>  he has the tenderest spirit of
gallantry towards us all </s>
<s> you must let me read it to him </s>
<s> 

harriet looked grave </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade </s>
<s> you
will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too
quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning
which may be affixed to it </s>
<s>  do not be overpowered by such a little
tribute of admiration </s>
<s>  if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not
have left the paper while i was by </s>
<s>  but he rather pushed it towards me
than towards you </s>
<s>  do not let us be too solemn on the business </s>
<s>  he has
encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over
this charade </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  noi hope i shall not be ridiculous about it </s>
<s>  do as you please </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the
recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does
your book go on </s>
<s> have you got any thing fresh </s>
<s> 

yes papa </s>
<s>  we have something to read you something quite fresh </s>
<s>  a
piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt we suppose
by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we have just copied
it in </s>
<s> 

she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and
distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every
part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and as she had
foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion </s>
<s> 

aye thats very just indeed thats very properly said </s>
<s>  very true </s>
<s> 
˜woman lovely woman </s>
<s>  it is such a pretty charade my dear that i
can easily guess what fairy brought it </s>
<s> nobody could have written so
prettily but you emma </s>
<s> 

emma only nodded and smiled </s>
<s> after a little thinking and a very
tender sigh he added

ah </s>
<s>  it is no difficulty to see who you take after </s>
<s>  your dear mother
was so clever at all those things </s>
<s>  if i had but her memory </s>
<s>  but i can
remember nothing </s>
<s> not even that particular riddle which you have
heard me mention </s>
<s>  i can only recollect the first stanza </s>
<s>  and there are
several </s>
<s> 

    kitty a fair but frozen maid
      kindled a flame i yet deplore
    the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid
    though of his near approach afraid
      so fatal to my suit before </s>
<s> 

and that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever all
the way through </s>
<s>  but i think my dear you said you had got it </s>
<s> 

yes papa it is written out in our second page </s>
<s>  we copied it from the
elegant extracts </s>
<s>  it was garricks you know </s>
<s> 

aye very true </s>
<s> i wish i could recollect more of it </s>
<s> 

    kitty a fair but frozen maid </s>
<s> 

the name makes me think of poor isabella </s>
<s>  for she was very near being
christened catherine after her grandmama </s>
<s>  i hope we shall have her here
next week </s>
<s>  have you thought my dear where you shall put herand what
room there will be for the children </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesshe will have her own room of course </s>
<s>  the room she always
has </s>
<s> and there is the nursery for the childrenjust as usual you
know </s>
<s>  why should there be any change </s>
<s> 

i do not know my dearbut it is so long since she was here </s>
<s> not
since last easter and then only for a few days </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  john knightleys
being a lawyer is very inconvenient </s>
<s> poor isabella </s>
<s> she is sadly taken
away from us all </s>
<s> and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see
miss taylor here </s>
<s> 

she will not be surprized papa at least </s>
<s> 

i do not know my dear </s>
<s>  i am sure i was very much surprized when i
first heard she was going to be married </s>
<s> 

we must ask <abvr> and <abvr> weston to dine with us while isabella is
here </s>
<s> 

yes my dear if there is time </s>
<s> butin a very depressed toneshe
is coming for only one week </s>
<s>  there will not be time for any thing </s>
<s> 

it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case of
necessity </s>
<s>  <abvr> john knightley must be in town again on the th and we
ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time
they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken
out for the abbey </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley promises to give up his claim this
christmasthough you know it is longer since they were with him than
with us </s>
<s> 

it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be
anywhere but at hartfield </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse could never allow for <abvr> knightleys claims on his
brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own </s>
<s>  he sat musing
a little while and then said

but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so
soon though he does </s>
<s>  i think emma i shall try and persuade her to
stay longer with us </s>
<s>  she and the children might stay very well </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish and i
do not think you ever will </s>
<s>  isabella cannot bear to stay behind her
husband </s>
<s> 

this was too true for contradiction </s>
<s>  unwelcome as it was <abvr> woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh </s>
<s>  and as emma saw his spirits affected
by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband she immediately
led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them </s>
<s> 

harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother
and sister are here </s>
<s>  i am sure she will be pleased with the children </s>
<s> 
we are very proud of the children are not we papa </s>
<s>  i wonder which she
will think the handsomest henry or john </s>
<s> 

aye i wonder which she will </s>
<s>  poor little dears how glad they will be
to come </s>
<s>  they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet </s>
<s> 

i dare say they are sir </s>
<s>  i am sure i do not know who is not </s>
<s> 

henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama </s>
<s>  henry is the
eldest he was named after me not after his father </s>
<s>  john the second
is named after his father </s>
<s>  some people are surprized i believe that
the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i
thought very pretty of her </s>
<s>  and he is a very clever boy indeed </s>
<s>  they
are all remarkably clever </s>
<s>  and they have so many pretty ways </s>
<s>  they will
come and stand by my chair and say ˜grandpapa can you give me a bit
of string </s>
<s>  and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives
were only made for grandpapas </s>
<s>  i think their father is too rough with
them very often </s>
<s> 

he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle
yourself </s>
<s>  but if you could compare him with other papas you would not
think him rough </s>
<s>  he wishes his boys to be active and hardy </s>
<s>  and if
they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then </s>
<s>  but he is an
affectionate fathercertainly <abvr> john knightley is an affectionate
father </s>
<s>  the children are all fond of him </s>
<s> 

and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a
very frightful way </s>
<s> 

but they like it papa </s>
<s>  there is nothing they like so much </s>
<s>  it is such
enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of
their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other </s>
<s> 

well i cannot understand it </s>
<s> 

that is the case with us all papa </s>
<s>  one half of the world cannot
understand the pleasures of the other </s>
<s> 

later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero of this
inimitable charade walked in again </s>
<s>  harriet turned away </s>
<s>  but emma could
receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in
his the consciousness of having made a pushof having thrown a die </s>
<s> 
and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up </s>
<s>  his ostensible
reason however was to ask whether <abvr> woodhouses party could be made
up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest
degree necessary at hartfield </s>
<s>  if he were every thing else must give
way </s>
<s>  but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his
dining with himhad made such a point of it that he had promised him
conditionally to come </s>
<s> 

emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend
on their account </s>
<s>  her father was sure of his rubber </s>
<s>  he reurgedshe
redeclined </s>
<s>  and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the
paper from the table she returned it

oh </s>
<s>  here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us </s>
<s>  thank
you for the sight of it </s>
<s>  we admired it so much that i have ventured
to write it into miss smiths collection </s>
<s>  your friend will not take it
amiss i hope </s>
<s>  of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight
lines </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton certainly did not very well know what to say </s>
<s>  he looked rather
doubtinglyrather confused </s>
<s>  said something about honourglanced at
emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took
it up and examined it very attentively </s>
<s>  with the view of passing off an
awkward moment emma smilingly said

you must make my apologies to your friend </s>
<s>  but so good a charade
must not be confined to one or two </s>
<s>  he may be sure of every womans
approbation while he writes with such gallantry </s>
<s> 

i have no hesitation in saying replied <abvr> elton though hesitating
a good deal while he spoke </s>
<s>  i have no hesitation in sayingat least
if my friend feels at all as i doi have not the smallest doubt that
could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it looking at the
book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the
proudest moment of his life </s>
<s> 

after this speech he was gone as soon as possible </s>
<s>  emma could not think
it too soon </s>
<s>  for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was
a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to
laugh </s>
<s>  she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and
the sublime of pleasure to harriets share </s>
<s> 



chapter x


though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to
prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise </s>
<s>  and on the
morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who
lived a little way out of highbury </s>
<s> 

their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane
leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of
the place </s>
<s>  and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about
a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not
very good house almost as close to the road as it could be </s>
<s>  it had
no advantage of situation </s>
<s>  but had been very much smartened up by the
present proprietor </s>
<s>  and such as it was there could be no possibility
of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing
eyes </s>
<s> emmas remark was

there it is </s>
<s>  there go you and your riddlebook one of these
days </s>
<s> harriets was

oh what a sweet house </s>
<s> how very beautiful </s>
<s> there are the yellow
curtains that miss nash admires so much </s>
<s> 

i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but
then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately
acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part
of highbury </s>
<s> 

harriet she found had never in her life been inside the vicarage
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors
and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with
mr </s>
<s>  eltons seeing ready wit in her </s>
<s> 

i wish we could contrive it said she </s>
<s>  but i cannot think of any
tolerable pretence for going in </s>
<s> no servant that i want to inquire
about of his housekeeperno message from my father </s>
<s> 

she pondered but could think of nothing </s>
<s>  after a mutual silence of some
minutes harriet thus began again

i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or
going to be married </s>
<s>  so charming as you are </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and replied

my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry </s>
<s> 
i must find other people charmingone other person at least </s>
<s>  and i
am not only not going to be married at present but have very little
intention of ever marrying at all </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> so you say </s>
<s>  but i cannot believe it </s>
<s> 

i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be
tempted </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton you know recollecting herself is out of the
question </s>
<s>  and i do not wish to see any such person </s>
<s>  i would rather not
be tempted </s>
<s>  i cannot really change for the better </s>
<s>  if i were to marry i
must expect to repent it </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s> it is so odd to hear a woman talk so </s>
<s> 

i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry </s>
<s>  were i to fall
in love indeed it would be a different thing </s>
<s>  but i never have been in
love </s>
<s>  it is not my way or my nature </s>
<s>  and i do not think i ever shall </s>
<s> 
and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a
situation as mine </s>
<s>  fortune i do not want </s>
<s>  employment i do not want </s>
<s> 
consequence i do not want </s>
<s>  i believe few married women are half as much
mistress of their husbands house as i am of hartfield </s>
<s>  and never never
could i expect to be so truly beloved and important </s>
<s>  so always first and
always right in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers </s>
<s> 

but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates </s>
<s> 

that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet </s>
<s>  and if
i thought i should ever be like miss bates </s>
<s>  so sillyso satisfiedso
smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidiousand so apt
to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry
tomorrow </s>
<s>  but between us i am convinced there never can be any
likeness except in being unmarried </s>
<s> 

but still you will be an old maid </s>
<s>  and thats so dreadful </s>
<s> 

never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid </s>
<s>  and it is poverty
only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public </s>
<s>  a single
woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old
maid </s>
<s>  the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good
fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant
as any body else </s>
<s>  and the distinction is not quite so much against the
candour and common sense of the world as appears at first </s>
<s>  for a very
narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper </s>
<s> 
those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and
generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross </s>
<s>  this
does not apply however to miss bates </s>
<s>  she is only too good natured and
too silly to suit me </s>
<s>  but in general she is very much to the taste
of every body though single and though poor </s>
<s>  poverty certainly has not
contracted her mind </s>
<s>  i really believe if she had only a shilling in the
world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it </s>
<s>  and nobody
is afraid of her </s>
<s>  that is a great charm </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  but what shall you do </s>
<s>  how shall you employ yourself when you
grow old </s>
<s> 

if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great
many independent resources </s>
<s>  and i do not perceive why i should be more
in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty </s>
<s>  womans
usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they
are now </s>
<s>  or with no important variation </s>
<s>  if i draw less i shall read
more </s>
<s>  if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork </s>
<s>  and as for
objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the
great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil
to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the
children of a sister i love so much to care about </s>
<s>  there will be enough
of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that
declining life can need </s>
<s>  there will be enough for every hope and every
fear </s>
<s>  and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it
suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder </s>
<s>  my
nephews and nieces </s>
<s> i shall often have a niece with me </s>
<s> 

do you know miss batess niece </s>
<s>  that is i know you must have seen her
a hundred timesbut are you acquainted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to
highbury </s>
<s>  by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit
with a niece </s>
<s>  heaven forbid </s>
<s>  at least that i should ever bore people
half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane
fairfax </s>
<s>  one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  every letter from
her is read forty times over </s>
<s>  her compliments to all friends go round
and round again </s>
<s>  and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a
stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of
nothing else for a month </s>
<s>  i wish jane fairfax very well </s>
<s>  but she tires
me to death </s>
<s> 

they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were
superseded </s>
<s>  emma was very compassionate </s>
<s>  and the distresses of the poor
were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her
counsel and her patience as from her purse </s>
<s>  she understood their ways
could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic
expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had
done so little </s>
<s>  entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and
always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as goodwill </s>
<s>  in
the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she
came to visit </s>
<s>  and after remaining there as long as she could give
comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of
the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away

these are the sights harriet to do one good </s>
<s>  how trifling they make
every thing else appear </s>
<s> i feel now as if i could think of nothing but
these poor creatures all the rest of the day </s>
<s>  and yet who can say how
soon it may all vanish from my mind </s>
<s> 

very true said harriet </s>
<s>  poor creatures </s>
<s>  one can think of nothing
else </s>
<s> 

and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said
emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended
the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them
into the lane again </s>
<s>  i do not think it will stopping to look once
more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still
greater within </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear no said her companion </s>
<s> 

they walked on </s>
<s>  the lane made a slight bend </s>
<s>  and when that bend was
passed <abvr> elton was immediately in sight </s>
<s>  and so near as to give emma
time only to say farther

ah </s>
<s>  harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good
thoughts </s>
<s>  well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion
has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that
is truly important </s>
<s>  if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can
for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves </s>
<s> 

harriet could just answer oh </s>
<s>  dear yes before the gentleman joined
them </s>
<s>  the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the
first subject on meeting </s>
<s>  he had been going to call on them </s>
<s>  his visit
he would now defer </s>
<s>  but they had a very interesting parley about
what could be done and should be done </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton then turned back to
accompany them </s>
<s> 

to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma </s>
<s> 
to meet in a charitable scheme </s>
<s>  this will bring a great increase
of love on each side </s>
<s>  i should not wonder if it were to bring on the
declaration </s>
<s>  it must if i were not here </s>
<s>  i wish i were anywhere else </s>
<s> 

anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one
side of the lane leaving them together in the main road </s>
<s>  but she had
not been there two minutes when she found that harriets habits of
dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short
they would both be soon after her </s>
<s>  this would not do </s>
<s>  she immediately
stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing
of her halfboot and stooping down in complete occupation of the
footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would
follow in half a minute </s>
<s>  they did as they were desired </s>
<s>  and by the time
she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort
of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the
cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch
broth from hartfield </s>
<s>  to walk by the side of this child and talk to
and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have
been the most natural had she been acting just then without design </s>
<s> 
and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without
any obligation of waiting for her </s>
<s>  she gained on them however
involuntarily </s>
<s>  the childs pace was quick and theirs rather slow </s>
<s> 
and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in
a conversation which interested them </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was speaking with
animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention </s>
<s>  and emma
having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back
a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail </s>
<s> 
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only
giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays party at his
friend coles and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese
the north wiltshire the butter the celery the beetroot and all the
dessert </s>
<s> 

this would soon have led to something better of course was her
consoling reflection </s>
<s>  any thing interests between those who love </s>
<s>  and
any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart </s>
<s>  if i
could but have kept longer away </s>
<s> 

they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage
pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the
house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and
fall behind to arrange it once more </s>
<s>  she then broke the lace off short
and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to
entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to
rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort </s>
<s> 

part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to
contrive </s>
<s>  i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i
hope i am not often so illequipped </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton i must beg leave to stop
at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string
or any thing just to keep my boot on </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton looked all happiness at this proposition </s>
<s>  and nothing could
exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and
endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage </s>
<s>  the room they were
taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards </s>
<s>  behind
it was another with which it immediately communicated </s>
<s>  the door between
them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive
her assistance in the most comfortable manner </s>
<s>  she was obliged to leave
the door ajar as she found it </s>
<s>  but she fully intended that <abvr> elton
should close it </s>
<s>  it was not closed however it still remained ajar </s>
<s>  but
by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make
it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining
room </s>
<s>  for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself </s>
<s>  it could be
protracted no longer </s>
<s>  she was then obliged to be finished and make her
appearance </s>
<s> 

the lovers were standing together at one of the windows </s>
<s>  it had a most
favourable aspect </s>
<s>  and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having
schemed successfully </s>
<s>  but it would not do </s>
<s>  he had not come to the point </s>
<s> 
he had been most agreeable most delightful </s>
<s>  he had told harriet that
he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them </s>
<s>  other little
gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious </s>
<s> 

cautious very cautious thought emma </s>
<s>  he advances inch by inch and
will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure </s>
<s> 

still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her
ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been
the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them
forward to the great event </s>

<s>  there are people who the more you do for them the less they
will do for themselves </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> john knightley from having been longer than usual absent
from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest </s>
<s> 
till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been
divided between hartfield and donwell abbey </s>
<s>  but all the holidays of
this autumn had been given to seabathing for the children and it was
therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their
surry connexions or seen at all by <abvr> woodhouse who could not be
induced to get so far as london even for poor isabellas sake </s>
<s>  and
who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in
forestalling this too short visit </s>
<s> 

he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little
of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some
of the party the last half of the way </s>
<s>  but his alarms were needless </s>
<s> 
the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and <abvr> and <abvr> john
knightley their five children and a competent number of nurserymaids
all reaching hartfield in safety </s>
<s>  the bustle and joy of such an arrival
the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed
and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could
not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even
for this </s>
<s>  but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father
were so respected by <abvr> john knightley that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their
having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and
drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for
without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long
a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance
on them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet
manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate </s>
<s>  wrapt
up in her family </s>
<s>  a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly
attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a
warmer love might have seemed impossible </s>
<s>  she could never see a fault
in any of them </s>
<s>  she was not a woman of strong understanding or any
quickness </s>
<s>  and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also
much of his constitution </s>
<s>  was delicate in her own health overcareful
of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond
of her own <abvr> wingfield in town as her father could be of <abvr> perry </s>
<s> 
they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong
habit of regard for every old acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man </s>
<s> 
rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private
character </s>
<s>  but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally
pleasing </s>
<s>  and capable of being sometimes out of humour </s>
<s>  he was not an
illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a
reproach </s>
<s>  but his temper was not his great perfection </s>
<s>  and indeed with
such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects
in it should not be increased </s>
<s>  the extreme sweetness of her temper
must hurt his </s>
<s>  he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she
wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing </s>
<s> 

he was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw </s>
<s>  nothing wrong
in him escaped her </s>
<s>  she was quick in feeling the little injuries to
isabella which isabella never felt herself </s>
<s>  perhaps she might have
passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellas sister
but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without
praise and without blindness </s>
<s>  but hardly any degree of personal
compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of
all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful
forbearance towards her father </s>
<s>  there he had not always the patience
that could have been wished </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouses peculiarities and
fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or
sharp retort equally illbestowed </s>
<s>  it did not often happen </s>
<s>  for <abvr> john
knightley had really a great regard for his fatherinlaw and generally
a strong sense of what was due to him </s>
<s>  but it was too often for emmas
charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently
to be endured though the offence came not </s>
<s>  the beginning however of
every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of
necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality </s>
<s> 
they had not been long seated and composed when <abvr> woodhouse with a
melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters attention
to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last </s>
<s> 

ah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business </s>
<s> 

oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her </s>
<s> 
and dear emma too </s>
<s> what a dreadful loss to you both </s>
<s> i have been so
grieved for you </s>
<s> i could not imagine how you could possibly do without
her </s>
<s> it is a sad change indeed </s>
<s> but i hope she is pretty well sir </s>
<s> 

pretty well my deari hopepretty well </s>
<s> i do not know but that the
place agrees with her tolerably </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts
of the air of randalls </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nonone in the least </s>
<s>  i never saw <abvr> weston better in my
lifenever looking so well </s>
<s>  papa is only speaking his own regret </s>
<s> 

very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply </s>
<s> 

and do you see her sir tolerably often </s>
<s>  asked isabella in the
plaintive tone which just suited her father </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse hesitated </s>
<s> not near so often my dear as i could wish </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they
married </s>
<s>  either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one
have we seen either <abvr> weston or <abvr> weston and generally both
either at randalls or hereand as you may suppose isabella most
frequently here </s>
<s>  they are very very kind in their visits </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
is really as kind as herself </s>
<s>  papa if you speak in that melancholy way
you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all </s>
<s>  every body must be
aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be
assured that <abvr> and <abvr> weston do really prevent our missing her by
any means to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact
truth </s>
<s> 

just as it should be said <abvr> john knightley and just as i hoped
it was from your letters </s>
<s>  her wish of shewing you attention could not be
doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy </s>
<s>  i
have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change
being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended </s>
<s>  and now you have
emmas account i hope you will be satisfied </s>
<s> 

why to be sure said <abvr> woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot
deny that <abvr> weston poor <abvr> weston does come and see us pretty
oftenbut thenshe is always obliged to go away again </s>
<s> 

it would be very hard upon <abvr> weston if she did not papa </s>
<s> you quite
forget poor <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that <abvr> weston has
some little claim </s>
<s>  you and i emma will venture to take the part of the
poor husband </s>
<s>  i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims
of the man may very likely strike us with equal force </s>
<s>  as for isabella
she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all
the <abvr> westons aside as much as she can </s>
<s> 

me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part </s>
<s> 
are you talking about me </s>
<s> i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a
greater advocate for matrimony than i am </s>
<s>  and if it had not been for
the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss
taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world </s>
<s>  and as to slighting
mr </s>
<s>  weston that excellent <abvr> weston i think there is nothing he does
not deserve </s>
<s>  i believe he is one of the very besttempered men that ever
existed </s>
<s>  excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal
for temper </s>
<s>  i shall never forget his flying henrys kite for him that
very windy day last easterand ever since his particular kindness last
september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i
have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better
man in existence </s>
<s> if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor </s>
<s> 

where is the young man </s>
<s>  said john knightley </s>
<s>  has he been here on this
occasionor has he not </s>
<s> 

he has not been here yet replied emma </s>
<s>  there was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in
nothing </s>
<s>  and i have not heard him mentioned lately </s>
<s> 

but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father </s>
<s> 
he wrote a letter to poor <abvr> weston to congratulate her and a very
proper handsome letter it was </s>
<s>  she shewed it to me </s>
<s>  i thought it very
well done of him indeed </s>
<s>  whether it was his own idea you know one
cannot tell </s>
<s>  he is but young and his uncle perhaps

my dear papa he is threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  you forget how time passes </s>
<s> 

threeandtwenty </s>
<s> is he indeed </s>
<s> well i could not have thought
itand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother </s>
<s>  well
time does fly indeed </s>
<s> and my memory is very bad </s>
<s>  however it was an
exceeding good pretty letter and gave <abvr> and <abvr> weston a great deal
of pleasure </s>
<s>  i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept </s>
<s> 
thand began ˜my dear madam but i forget how it went on </s>
<s>  and it
was signed ˜f </s>
<s>  c </s>
<s>  weston churchill </s>
<s> i remember that perfectly </s>
<s> 

how very pleasing and proper of him </s>
<s>  cried the goodhearted <abvr> john
knightley </s>
<s>  i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man </s>
<s>  but
how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father </s>
<s>  there is
something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his parents and
natural home </s>
<s>  i never could comprehend how <abvr> weston could part with
him </s>
<s>  to give up ones child </s>
<s>  i really never could think well of any body
who proposed such a thing to any body else </s>
<s> 

nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed <abvr>
john knightley coolly </s>
<s>  but you need not imagine <abvr> weston to have felt
what you would feel in giving up henry or john </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston is rather
an easy cheerfultempered man than a man of strong feelings </s>
<s>  he takes
things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other
depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his
comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing
whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection
or any thing that home affords </s>
<s> 

emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on <abvr> weston and had
half a mind to take it up </s>
<s>  but she struggled and let it pass </s>
<s>  she
would keep the peace if possible </s>
<s>  and there was something honourable and
valuable in the strong domestic habits the allsufficiency of home to
himself whence resulted her brothers disposition to look down on
the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was
important </s>
<s> it had a high claim to forbearance </s>

chapter xii


mr </s>
<s>  knightley was to dine with themrather against the inclination of
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in
isabellas first day </s>
<s>  emmas sense of right however had decided it </s>
<s> 
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had
particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement
between <abvr> knightley and herself in procuring him the proper
invitation </s>
<s> 

she hoped they might now become friends again </s>
<s>  she thought it was time
to make up </s>
<s>  makingup indeed would not do </s>
<s>  she certainly had not been
in the wrong and he would never own that he had </s>
<s>  concession must be
out of the question </s>
<s>  but it was time to appear to forget that they had
ever quarrelled </s>
<s>  and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of
friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children
with herthe youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who
was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced
about in her aunts arms </s>
<s>  it did assist </s>
<s>  for though he began with grave
looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in
the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the
unceremoniousness of perfect amity </s>
<s>  emma felt they were friends again </s>
<s> 
and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then
a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the
baby

what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces </s>
<s> 
as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different </s>
<s>  but with
regard to these children i observe we never disagree </s>
<s> 

if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women
and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with
them as you are where these children are concerned we might always
think alike </s>
<s> 

to be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being in the
wrong </s>
<s> 

yes said he smilingand reason good </s>
<s>  i was sixteen years old when
you were born </s>
<s> 

a material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were much
my superior in judgment at that period of our lives </s>
<s>  but does not the
lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings a good deal
nearer </s>
<s> 

yesa good deal nearer </s>
<s> 

but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we
think differently </s>
<s> 

i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child </s>
<s>  come my dear emma
let us be friends and say no more about it </s>
<s>  tell your aunt little
emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old
grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now </s>
<s> 

thats true she criedvery true </s>
<s>  little emma grow up a better
woman than your aunt </s>
<s>  be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited </s>
<s> 
now <abvr> knightley a word or two more and i have done </s>
<s>  as far as good
intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on
my side of the argument have yet proved wrong </s>
<s>  i only want to know that
mr </s>
<s>  martin is not very very bitterly disappointed </s>
<s> 

a man cannot be more so was his short full answer </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> indeed i am very sorry </s>
<s> come shake hands with me </s>
<s> 

this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley
made his appearance and how dye do george </s>
<s>  and john how are
you </s>
<s>  succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that
seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led
either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the
other </s>
<s> 

the evening was quiet and conversable as <abvr> woodhouse declined cards
entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and
the little party made two natural divisions </s>
<s>  on one side he and his
daughter </s>
<s>  on the other the two <abvr> knightleys </s>
<s>  their subjects totally
distinct or very rarely mixingand emma only occasionally joining in
one or the other </s>
<s> 

the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally
of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative
and who was always the greater talker </s>
<s>  as a magistrate he had generally
some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious
anecdote to give </s>
<s>  and as a farmer as keeping in hand the homefarm at
donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to
give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting
to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his
life and whose attachments were strong </s>
<s>  the plan of a drain the change
of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for
wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality
of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible </s>
<s>  and if his
willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries
even approached a tone of eagerness </s>
<s> 

while they were thus comfortably occupied <abvr> woodhouse was enjoying a
full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter </s>
<s> 

my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and
interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her
five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you were here </s>
<s> 
and how tired you must be after your journey </s>
<s>  you must go to bed early
my dearand i recommend a little gruel to you before you go </s>
<s> you and
i will have a nice basin of gruel together </s>
<s>  my dear emma suppose we all
have a little gruel </s>
<s> 

emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself </s>
<s> and
two basins only were ordered </s>
<s>  after a little more discourse in praise of
gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every
body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection

it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south
end instead of coming here </s>

<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wingfield most strenuously recommended it siror we should not
have gone </s>

the weakness in little bellas throatboth sea air and bathing </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any
good </s>
<s>  and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though

oh </s>
<s>  my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any
uneasiness about it </s>

her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of <abvr>

it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use
to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have
spoken to

<s>  my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always
a sickly season </s>
<s>  nobody is healthy in london nobody can be </s>
<s>  it is a
dreadful thing to have you forced to live there </s>

<s> and the
air so bad </s>
<s> 

no indeedwe are not at all in a bad air </s>
<s>  our part of london is
very superior to most others </s>
<s> you must not confound us with london
in general my dear sir </s>
<s>  the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very

<s>  i should be
unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town </s>
<s> there is
hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in </s>
<s> 
but we are so remarkably airy </s>
<s> <abvr> wingfield thinks the vicinity of
brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air </s>
<s> 

ah </s>

<s>  you make the best of itbut
after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different

free from anywhere i am quite well myself </s>

rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a
little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of
coming </s>
<s>  i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow </s>
<s>  for i
assure you <abvr> wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever
sent us off altogether in such good case </s>
<s>  i trust at least that
you do not think <abvr> knightley looking ill turning her eyes with
affectionate anxiety towards her husband </s>

middling my dear </s>
<s>  i cannot compliment you </s>
<s>  i think <abvr> john knightley
very far from looking well </s>

what is the matter sir </s>
<s> did you speak to me </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> john
knightley hearing his own name </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking
wellbut i hope it is only from being a little fatigued </s>
<s>  i could have
wished however as you know that you had seen <abvr> wingfield before you

from scotland to look after his new estate </s>
<s>  what will it answer </s>
<s>  will
not the old prejudice be too strong </s>
<s> 

and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to
give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing
worse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and jane
fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that
moment very happy to assist in praising </s>

that sweet amiable jane fairfax </s>
<s>  said <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> it
is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment
accidentally in town </s>
<s>  what happiness it must be to her good old
grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them </s>
<s>  i always
regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot be more at
highbury </s>
<s>  but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and <abvr>
campbell will not be able to part with her at all </s>
<s>  she would be such a
delightful companion for emma </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse agreed to it all but added

our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty
kind of young person </s>
<s>  you will like harriet </s>

better companion than harriet </s>
<s> 

i am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be so
very accomplished and superior </s>
<s> and exactly emmas age </s>
<s> 

this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar
moment and passed away with similar harmony </s>
<s>  but the evening did not
close without a little return of agitation </s>
<s>  the gruel came and supplied
a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many commentsundoubting
decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty
severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with
tolerably </s>
<s> but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter
had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in
her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never
had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth
gruel thin but not too thin </s>
<s>  often as she had wished for and ordered
it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable </s>
<s>  here was a
dangerous opening </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her
with tender concern </s>
<s> the ejaculation in emmas ear expressed ah </s>
<s> 
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end </s>
<s>  it
does not bear talking of </s>
<s>  and for a little while she hoped he would not
talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to
the relish of his own smooth gruel </s>
<s>  after an interval of some minutes
however he began with

i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn
instead of coming here </s>
<s> 

but why should you be sorry sir </s>
<s> i assure you it did the children a
great deal of good </s>
<s> 

and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been
to south end </s>
<s>  south end is an unhealthy place </s>
<s>  perry was surprized to
hear you had fixed upon south end </s>
<s> 

i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite
a mistake sir </s>
<s> we all had our health perfectly well there never
found the least inconvenience from the mud </s>
<s>  and <abvr> wingfield says it is
entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy </s>
<s>  and i am sure he may
be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and
his own brother and family have been there repeatedly </s>
<s> 

you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere </s>
<s> perry
was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the
seabathing places </s>
<s>  a fine open sea he says and very pure air </s>
<s>  and by
what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from
the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable </s>
<s>  you should have
consulted perry </s>
<s> 

but my dear sir the difference of the journey </s>
<s> only consider how
great it would have been </s>
<s> an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else
should be considered </s>
<s>  and if one is to travel there is not much to
chuse between forty miles and an hundred </s>
<s> better not move at all
better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into
a worse air </s>
<s>  this is just what perry said </s>
<s>  it seemed to him a very

chapter xiii


there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than <abvr> john
knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning
among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what
she had done every evening with her father and sister </s>
<s>  she had nothing
to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly </s>
<s>  it was a
delightful visit </s>
<s> perfect in being much too short </s>
<s> 

in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their
mornings </s>
<s>  but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too
there was no avoiding though at christmas </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would take no
denial </s>
<s>  they must all dine at randalls one day </s>
<s> even <abvr> woodhouse was
persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of
the party </s>
<s> 

how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he
could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses were actually
at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on
that head </s>
<s>  it hardly amounted to a doubt </s>
<s>  nor did it occupy emma long
to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for
harriet also </s>
<s> 

harriet <abvr> elton and <abvr> knightley their own especial set were the
only persons invited to meet them </s>
<s> the hours were to be early as
well as the numbers few </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouses habits and inclination being
consulted in every thing </s>
<s> 

the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse should dine out on the th of december had been spent
by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with
a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by <abvr>
goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house </s>
<s>  emma called
on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to
randalls </s>
<s>  she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddard
was full of care and affection <abvr> perry was talked of and harriet
herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her
from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss
without many tears </s>
<s> 

emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in <abvr> goddards
unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much <abvr>
eltons would be depressed when he knew her state </s>
<s>  and left her at last
tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most
comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much </s>
<s>  she had not
advanced many yards from <abvr> goddards door when she was met by <abvr>
elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly
together in conversation about the invalidof whom he on the rumour
of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might
carry some report of her to hartfieldthey were overtaken by <abvr> john
knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest
boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country
run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice
pudding they were hastening home for </s>
<s>  they joined company and
proceeded together </s>
<s>  emma was just describing the nature of her friends
complaint </s>
<s> a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat
about her a quick low pulse &c </s>
<s>  and she was sorry to find from <abvr>
goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often
alarmed her with them </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton looked all alarm on the occasion as
he exclaimed

a sorethroat </s>
<s> i hope not infectious </s>
<s>  i hope not of a putrid
infectious sort </s>
<s>  has perry seen her </s>
<s>  indeed you should take care of
yourself as well as of your friend </s>
<s>  let me entreat you to run no risks </s>
<s> 
why does not perry see her </s>
<s> 

emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of <abvr> goddards experience and
care </s>
<s>  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she
could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist
than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite another subject

it is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much like
snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i
should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father from
venturing </s>
<s>  but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the
cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great
a disappointment to <abvr> and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  but upon my word <abvr> elton
in your case i should certainly excuse myself </s>
<s>  you appear to me a
little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and
what fatigues tomorrow will bring i think it would be no more than
common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself tonight </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make </s>
<s> 
which was exactly the case </s>
<s>  for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of hers
he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit </s>
<s> but emma
too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him
impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with
his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very
cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls
and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour
of the evening </s>
<s> 

you do quite right said she </s>
<s> we will make your apologies to <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s> 

but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly
offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were <abvr> eltons only
objection and <abvr> elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt
satisfaction </s>
<s>  it was a done thing </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was to go and never had
his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment </s>
<s> 
never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when
he next looked at her </s>
<s> 

well said she to herself this is most strange </s>
<s> after i had got
him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill
behind </s>
<s> most strange indeed </s>
<s> but there is i believe in many men
especially single men such an inclinationsuch a passion for dining
outa dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures
their employments their dignities almost their duties that any
thing gives way to itand this must be the case with <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  a most
valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love
with harriet </s>
<s>  but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine
out wherever he is asked </s>
<s>  what a strange thing love is </s>
<s>  he can see ready
wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her </s>
<s> 

soon afterwards <abvr> elton quitted them and she could not but do him
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his
manner of naming harriet at parting </s>
<s>  in the tone of his voice while
assuring her that he should call at <abvr> goddards for news of her fair
friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting
her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report </s>
<s>  and
he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of
approbation much in his favour </s>
<s> 

after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began
with

i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned </s>
<s>  with
men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please
every feature works </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  eltons manners are not perfect replied emma </s>
<s>  but where there is
a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great
deal </s>
<s>  where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will
have the advantage over negligent superiority </s>
<s>  there is such perfect
goodtemper and goodwill in <abvr> elton as one cannot but value </s>
<s> 

yes said <abvr> john knightley presently with some slyness he seems
to have a great deal of goodwill towards you </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to
be <abvr> eltons object </s>
<s> 

such an imagination has crossed me i own emma </s>
<s>  and if it never
occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton in love with me </s>
<s> what an idea </s>
<s> 

i do not say it is so </s>
<s>  but you will do well to consider whether it
is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly </s>
<s>  i think your
manners to him encouraging </s>
<s>  i speak as a friend emma </s>
<s>  you had better
look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do </s>
<s> 

i thank you </s>
<s>  but i assure you you are quite mistaken </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton and
i are very good friends and nothing more </s>
<s>  and she walked on amusing
herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a
partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high
pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into </s>
<s>  and not very well
pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in
want of counsel </s>
<s>  he said no more </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in
spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking
from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest
daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the
weather than either of the others </s>
<s>  too full of the wonder of his own
going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was
cold and too well wrapt up to feel it </s>
<s>  the cold however was severe </s>
<s> 
and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow
were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so
overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world
in a very short time </s>
<s> 

emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour </s>
<s>  the
preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of
his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least
which <abvr> john knightley did not by any means like </s>
<s>  he anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase </s>
<s>  and the
whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his
discontent </s>
<s> 

a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks
people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as
this for the sake of coming to see him </s>
<s>  he must think himself a most
agreeable fellow </s>
<s>  i could not do such a thing </s>
<s>  it is the greatest
absurdityactually snowing at this moment </s>
<s> the folly of not allowing
people to be comfortable at homeand the folly of peoples not staying
comfortably at home when they can </s>
<s>  if we were obliged to go out such
an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we
should deem it </s>
<s> and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing
than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of
the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view
or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter
that he can </s>
<s> here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in
another mans house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again tomorrow </s>
<s> 
going in dismal weather to return probably in worse </s>
<s> four horses and
four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering
creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had
at home </s>
<s> 

emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no
doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true
my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling
companion </s>
<s>  but she had resolution enough to refrain from making
any answer at all </s>
<s>  she could not be complying she dreaded being
quarrelsome </s>
<s>  her heroism reached only to silence </s>
<s>  she allowed him to
talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening
her lips </s>
<s> 

they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and <abvr> elton
spruce black and smiling was with them instantly </s>
<s>  emma thought with
pleasure of some change of subject </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was all obligation and
cheerfulness </s>
<s>  he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she
began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from
what had reached her </s>
<s>  she had sent while dressing and the answer had
been much the samenot better </s>
<s> 

my report from <abvr> goddards said she presently was not so
pleasant as i had hoped˜not better was my answer </s>
<s> 

his face lengthened immediately </s>
<s>  and his voice was the voice of
sentiment as he answered </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  noi am grieved to findi was on the point of telling you that
when i called at <abvr> goddards door which i did the very last thing
before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better
by no means better rather worse </s>
<s>  very much grieved and concernedi
had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i
knew had been given her in the morning </s>
<s> 

emma smiled and answeredmy visit was of use to the nervous part of
her complaint i hope </s>
<s>  but not even i can charm away a sore throat </s>
<s> 
it is a most severe cold indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry has been with her as you
probably heard </s>
<s> 

yesi imaginedthat isi did not

he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope tomorrow
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report </s>
<s>  but it is
impossible not to feel uneasiness </s>
<s>  such a sad loss to our party today </s>
<s> 

dreadful </s>
<s> exactly so indeed </s>
<s> she will be missed every moment </s>
<s> 

this was very proper </s>
<s>  the sigh which accompanied it was really
estimable </s>
<s>  but it should have lasted longer </s>
<s>  emma was rather in dismay
when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment </s>
<s> 

what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for
carriages </s>
<s>  how very comfortable they make it </s>
<s> impossible to feel cold
with such precautions </s>
<s>  the contrivances of modern days indeed have
rendered a gentlemans carriage perfectly complete </s>
<s>  one is so fenced
and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way
unpermitted </s>
<s>  weather becomes absolutely of no consequence </s>
<s>  it is a very
cold afternoonbut in this carriage we know nothing of the matter </s>
<s> ha </s>
<s> 
snows a little i see </s>
<s> 

yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of
it </s>
<s> 

christmas weather observed <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  quite seasonable </s>
<s>  and
extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin
yesterday and prevent this days party which it might very possibly
have done for <abvr> woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been
much snow on the ground </s>
<s>  but now it is of no consequence </s>
<s>  this is quite
the season indeed for friendly meetings </s>
<s>  at christmas every body invites
their friends about them and people think little of even the worst
weather </s>
<s>  i was snowed up at a friends house once for a week </s>
<s>  nothing
could be pleasanter </s>
<s>  i went for only one night and could not get away
till that very day sennight </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but
said only coolly

i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls </s>
<s> 

at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much
astonished now at <abvr> eltons spirits for other feelings </s>
<s>  harriet seemed
quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party </s>
<s> 

we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the
greatest comfort </s>
<s>  charming people <abvr> and <abvr> weston </s>
<s> <abvr> weston
indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so
hospitable and so fond of society </s>
<s> it will be a small party but where
small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  westons diningroom does not accommodate more than ten comfortably </s>
<s> 
and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by
two than exceed by two </s>
<s>  i think you will agree with me turning with
a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation

london may not quite enter into our feelings </s>

indeed </s>

<s>  well sir the time must come when you will
be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great
enjoyment </s>

chapter xiv


some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they
walked into <abvr> westons drawingroom </s>
<s> <abvr> elton must compose his
joyous looks and <abvr> john knightley disperse his illhumour </s>
<s>  <abvr>
elton must smile less and <abvr> john knightley more to fit them for the
place </s>
<s> emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as
happy as she was </s>
<s>  to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the
world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife </s>
<s>  not any
one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and
understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the
little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father
and herself </s>
<s>  she could tell nothing of hartfield in which <abvr> weston
had not a lively concern </s>
<s>  and half an hours uninterrupted communication
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life
depends was one of the first gratifications of each </s>
<s> 

this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might not
afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour </s>
<s>  but the
very sight of <abvr> weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful
to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of <abvr>
eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that
was enjoyable to the utmost </s>
<s> 

the misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through
before her arrival </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse had been safely seated long enough
to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and
isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed just
got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his
daughter when the others appeared and <abvr> weston who had been almost
wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and
welcome her dear emma </s>
<s> 

emmas project of forgetting <abvr> elton for a while made her rather sorry
to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her </s>
<s> 
the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards
harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but
was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and
solicitously addressing her upon every occasion </s>
<s>  instead of forgetting
him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal
suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined </s>
<s>  can it be
possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from
harriet to me </s>
<s> absurd and insufferable </s>
<s> yet he would be so anxious
for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father
and so delighted with <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  and at last would begin admiring her
drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly
like a wouldbe lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her
good manners </s>
<s>  for her own sake she could not be rude </s>
<s>  and for harriets
in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively
civil </s>
<s>  but it was an effort </s>
<s>  especially as something was going on
amongst the others in the most overpowering period of <abvr> eltons
nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to </s>
<s>  she heard enough
to know that <abvr> weston was giving some information about his son </s>
<s>  she
heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several
times over </s>
<s>  and from a few other halfsyllables very much suspected
that he was announcing an early visit from his son </s>
<s>  but before she could
quiet <abvr> elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving
question from her would have been awkward </s>
<s> 

now it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never
marrying there was something in the name in the idea of <abvr>
frank churchill which always interested her </s>
<s>  she had frequently
thoughtespecially since his fathers marriage with miss taylorthat
if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age
character and condition </s>
<s>  he seemed by this connexion between the
families quite to belong to her </s>
<s>  she could not but suppose it to be
a match that every body who knew them must think of </s>
<s>  that <abvr> and <abvr>
weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded </s>
<s>  and though
not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a
situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could
change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention
of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and
a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends
imaginations </s>
<s> 

with such sensations <abvr> eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed </s>
<s> 
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very
crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly
pass without bringing forward the same information again or the
substance of it from the openhearted <abvr> weston </s>
<s> so it proved </s>
<s> for
when happily released from <abvr> elton and seated by <abvr> weston
at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of
hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to
her

we want only two more to be just the right number </s>
<s>  i should like to see
two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith and my sonand
then i should say we were quite complete </s>
<s>  i believe you did not hear me
telling the others in the drawingroom that we are expecting frank </s>
<s> 
i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a
fortnight </s>
<s> 

emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure </s>
<s>  and fully assented to
his proposition of <abvr> frank churchill and miss smith making their party
quite complete </s>
<s> 

he has been wanting to come to us continued <abvr> weston ever since
september </s>
<s>  every letter has been full of it </s>
<s>  but he cannot command his
own time </s>
<s>  he has those to please who must be pleased and who between
ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices </s>
<s> 
but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in
january </s>
<s> 

what a very great pleasure it will be to you </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston is so
anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as
yourself </s>
<s> 

yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another putoff </s>
<s> 
she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do </s>
<s>  but she does not
know the parties so well as i do </s>
<s>  the case you see isbut this is
quite between ourselves </s>
<s>  i did not mention a syllable of it in the other
room </s>
<s>  there are secrets in all families you knowthe case is that a
party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january </s>
<s>  and
that franks coming depends upon their being put off </s>
<s>  if they are not
put off he cannot stir </s>
<s>  but i know they will because it is a family
that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular
dislike to </s>
<s>  and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in
two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point </s>
<s> 
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue </s>
<s>  i am as confident of seeing
frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself </s>
<s> 
but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table
has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at
hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been
long in the practice of doing </s>
<s> 

i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied
emma </s>
<s>  but am disposed to side with you <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  if you think he
will come i shall think so too </s>
<s>  for you know enscombe </s>
<s> 

yesi have some right to that knowledge </s>
<s>  though i have never been at
the place in my life </s>
<s> she is an odd woman </s>
<s> but i never allow myself
to speak ill of her on franks account </s>
<s>  for i do believe her to be very
fond of him </s>
<s>  i used to think she was not capable of being fond of
any body except herself </s>
<s>  but she has always been kind to him in her
wayallowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing
to be as she likes </s>
<s>  and it is no small credit in my opinion to him
that he should excite such an affection </s>
<s>  for though i would not say
it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in
general </s>
<s>  and the devil of a temper </s>
<s> 

emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to <abvr> weston
very soon after their moving into the drawingroom </s>
<s>  wishing her joyyet
observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  weston agreed to it </s>

secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked
of </s>
<s>  for i cannot depend upon his coming </s>

mr </s>

<s>  i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands </s>

churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world </s>

<s>  then turning to isabella who had not been attending
beforeyou must know my dear <abvr> knightley that we are by no means

the truth </s>

<s>  every body knows <abvr> churchill replied isabella </s>
<s> 
and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest
compassion </s>
<s>  to be constantly living with an illtempered person must
be dreadful </s>
<s>  it is what we happily have never known any thing of </s>
<s>  but
it must be a life of misery </s>
<s>  what a blessing that she never had any
children </s>
<s>  poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them </s>
<s> 

emma wished she had been alone with <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she should then have
heard more </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve
which she would not hazard with isabella </s>
<s>  and she really believed
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills
from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge </s>
<s>  but at
present there was nothing more to be said </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse very soon
followed them into the drawingroom </s>
<s>  to be sitting long after
dinner was a confinement that he could not endure </s>
<s>  neither wine nor
conversation was any thing to him </s>
<s>  and gladly did he move to those with
whom he was always comfortable </s>
<s> 

while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of
saying

and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means
certain </s>
<s>  i am sorry for it </s>
<s>  the introduction must be unpleasant
whenever it takes place </s>
<s>  and the sooner it could be over the better </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays </s>
<s>  even
if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that
some excuse may be found for disappointing us </s>
<s>  i cannot bear to imagine
any reluctance on his side </s>
<s>  but i am sure there is a great wish on
the churchills to keep him to themselves </s>
<s>  there is jealousy </s>
<s>  they
are jealous even of his regard for his father </s>
<s>  in short i can feel no
dependence on his coming and i wish <abvr> weston were less sanguine </s>
<s> 

he ought to come said emma </s>
<s>  if he could stay only a couple of days
he ought to come </s>
<s>  and one can hardly conceive a young mans not having
it in his power to do as much as that </s>
<s>  a young woman if she fall into
bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants
to be with </s>
<s>  but one cannot comprehend a young man˜s being under such
restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he
likes it </s>
<s> 

one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before
one decides upon what he can do replied <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  one ought to
use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one
individual of any one family </s>
<s>  but enscombe i believe certainly must
not be judged by general rules </s>
<s>  she is so very unreasonable </s>
<s>  and every
thing gives way to her </s>
<s> 

but she is so fond of the nephew </s>
<s>  he is so very great a favourite </s>
<s>  now
according to my idea of <abvr> churchill it would be most natural that
while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she
owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him
she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes
nothing at all </s>
<s> 

my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand
a bad one or to lay down rules for it </s>
<s>  you must let it go its own way </s>
<s> 
i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence </s>
<s>  but it
may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will
be </s>
<s> 

emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless
he comes </s>
<s> 

he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued <abvr>
weston and on others very little </s>
<s>  and among those on which she is
beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of
his coming away from them to visit us </s>

chapter xv


mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was soon ready for his tea </s>
<s>  and when he had drank his
tea he was quite ready to go home </s>
<s>  and it was as much as his three
companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of
the hour before the other gentlemen appeared </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was chatty and
convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort </s>
<s>  but at last
the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton in very
good spirits was one of the first to walk in </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston and emma
were sitting together on a sofa </s>
<s>  he joined them immediately and with
scarcely an invitation seated himself between them </s>
<s> 

emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by
the expectation of <abvr> frank churchill was willing to forget his late
improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his
making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most
friendly smiles </s>
<s> 

he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friendher fair
lovely amiable friend </s>
<s>  did she know </s>
<s> had she heard any thing about
her since their being at randalls </s>
<s> he felt much anxietyhe must
confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably </s>
<s> 
 and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much
attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror
of a bad sore throat </s>
<s>  and emma was quite in charity with him </s>
<s> 

but at last there seemed a perverse turn </s>
<s>  it seemed all at once as if he
were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on
harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection than
that there should be no infection in the complaint </s>
<s>  he began with great
earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sickchamber
again for the presentto entreat her to promise him not to venture
into such hazard till he had seen <abvr> perry and learnt his opinion </s>
<s>  and
though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its
proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude
about her </s>
<s>  she was vexed </s>
<s>  it did appearthere was no concealing
itexactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of
harriet </s>
<s>  an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable </s>
<s> 
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper </s>
<s>  he turned to <abvr> weston
to implore her assistance would not she give him her support </s>
<s> would
not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go
to <abvr> goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder had
no infection </s>
<s>  he could not be satisfied without a promisewould not she
give him her influence in procuring it </s>
<s> 

so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for
herself </s>
<s>  she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today and
yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore
throat herself </s>
<s>  is this fair <abvr> weston </s>
<s> judge between us </s>
<s>  have not i
some right to complain </s>
<s>  i am sure of your kind support and aid </s>
<s> 

emma saw <abvr> westons surprize and felt that it must be great at an
address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of
first interest in her </s>
<s>  and as for herself she was too much provoked and
offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose </s>
<s> 
she could only give him a look </s>
<s>  but it was such a look as she thought
must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a
seat by her sister and giving her all her attention </s>
<s> 

she had not time to know how <abvr> elton took the reproof so rapidly did
another subject succeed </s>
<s>  for <abvr> john knightley now came into the room
from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information
of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing
fast with a strong drifting wind </s>
<s>  concluding with these words to <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s> 

this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements
sir </s>
<s>  something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way
through a storm of snow </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> woodhouse was silent from consternation </s>
<s>  but every body else
had something to say </s>
<s>  every body was either surprized or not surprized
and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his
soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly </s>
<s> 

i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out
in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon </s>
<s> 
every body must have seen the snow coming on </s>
<s>  i admired your spirit </s>
<s>  and
i dare say we shall get home very well </s>
<s>  another hour or twos snow can
hardly make the road impassable </s>
<s>  and we are two carriages </s>
<s>  if one is
blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other
at hand </s>
<s>  i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he
had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest
it should make <abvr> woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his
hurrying away </s>
<s>  as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely
to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke </s>
<s>  he was afraid they
would find no difficulty </s>
<s>  he wished the road might be impassable that
he might be able to keep them all at randalls </s>
<s>  and with the utmost
goodwill was sure that accommodation might be found for every body
calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance
every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the
consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house </s>
<s> 

what is to be done my dear emma </s>
<s> what is to be done </s>
<s>  was <abvr>
woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say for some
time </s>
<s>  to her he looked for comfort </s>
<s>  and her assurances of safety her
representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of
their having so many friends about them revived him a little </s>
<s> 

his eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own </s>
<s>  the horror of being
blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full
in her imagination </s>
<s>  and fancying the road to be now just passable for
adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager
to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls
while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible
accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them </s>
<s> 

you had better order the carriage directly my love said she </s>
<s>  i dare
say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly </s>
<s>  and if we
do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk </s>
<s>  i am not at all
afraid </s>
<s>  i should not mind walking half the way </s>
<s>  i could change my shoes
you know the moment i got home </s>
<s>  and it is not the sort of thing that
gives me cold </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  replied he </s>
<s>  then my dear isabella it is the most
extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing
does give you cold </s>
<s>  walk home </s>
<s> you are prettily shod for walking home
i dare say </s>
<s>  it will be bad enough for the horses </s>
<s> 

isabella turned to <abvr> weston for her approbation of the plan </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston could only approve </s>
<s>  isabella then went to emma </s>
<s>  but emma could
not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away </s>
<s> 
and they were still discussing the point when <abvr> knightley who had
left the room immediately after his brothers first report of the snow
came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine
and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their
getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence </s>
<s>  he
had gone beyond the sweepsome way along the highbury roadthe snow
was nowhere above half an inch deepin many places hardly enough to
whiten the ground </s>
<s>  a very few flakes were falling at present but the
clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon
over </s>
<s>  he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there
being nothing to apprehend </s>
<s> 

to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were
scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account who
was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous
constitution allowed </s>
<s>  but the alarm that had been raised could not be
appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at
randalls </s>
<s>  he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning
home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay </s>
<s>  and
while the others were variously urging and recommending <abvr> knightley
and emma settled it in a few brief sentences </s>
<s>  thus

your father will not be easy </s>
<s>  why do not you go </s>
<s> 

i am ready if the others are </s>
<s> 

shall i ring the bell </s>
<s> 

yes do </s>
<s> 

and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for </s>
<s>  a few minutes more
and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own
house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and
happiness when this visit of hardship were over </s>
<s> 

the carriage came </s>
<s>  and <abvr> woodhouse always the first object on such
occasions was carefully attended to his own by <abvr> knightley and <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal
of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the
discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for </s>
<s>  he was
afraid they should have a very bad drive </s>
<s>  he was afraid poor isabella
would not like it </s>
<s>  and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind </s>
<s> 
he did not know what they had best do </s>
<s>  they must keep as much together
as they could </s>
<s>  and james was talked to and given a charge to go very
slow and wait for the other carriage </s>
<s> 

isabella stept in after her father </s>
<s>  john knightley forgetting that he
did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally </s>
<s> 
so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second
carriage by <abvr> elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them
and that they were to have a teteatete drive </s>
<s>  it would not have been
the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure
previous to the suspicions of this very day </s>
<s>  she could have talked to
him of harriet and the threequarters of a mile would have seemed but
one </s>
<s>  but now she would rather it had not happened </s>
<s>  she believed he had
been drinking too much of <abvr> westons good wine and felt sure that he
would want to be talking nonsense </s>
<s> 

to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of
the weather and the night </s>
<s>  but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they
passed the sweepgate and joined the other carriage than she found her
subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded and <abvr> elton
actually making violent love to her </s>
<s>  availing himself of the precious
opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known
hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him </s>
<s>  but
flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and
unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short
very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible </s>
<s>  it
really was so </s>
<s>  without scruplewithout apologywithout much apparent
diffidence <abvr> elton the lover of harriet was professing himself
her lover </s>
<s>  she tried to stop him </s>
<s>  but vainly </s>
<s>  he would go on and say
it all </s>
<s>  angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to
restrain herself when she did speak </s>
<s>  she felt that half this folly must
be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to
the passing hour </s>
<s>  accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the
playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she
replied

i am very much astonished <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  this to me </s>
<s>  you forget
yourselfyou take me for my friendany message to miss smith i shall
be happy to deliver </s>
<s>  but no more of this to me if you please </s>
<s> 

miss smith </s>
<s> message to miss smith </s>
<s> what could she possibly
mean </s>
<s> and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such
boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with
quickness

mr </s>
<s>  elton this is the most extraordinary conduct </s>
<s>  and i can account
for it only in one way </s>
<s>  you are not yourself or you could not speak
either to me or of harriet in such a manner </s>
<s>  command yourself enough
to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at
all to confuse his intellects </s>
<s>  he perfectly knew his own meaning </s>
<s>  and
having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and
slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friendbut
acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at allhe
resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a
favourable answer </s>
<s> 

as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his
inconstancy and presumption </s>
<s>  and with fewer struggles for politeness
replied

it is impossible for me to doubt any longer </s>
<s>  you have made yourself
too clear </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can
express </s>
<s>  after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last
month to miss smithsuch attentions as i have been in the daily
habit of observingto be addressing me in this mannerthis is an
unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible </s>
<s> 
believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object
of such professions </s>
<s>

<s>  cried <abvr> elton what can be the meaning of this </s>
<s> miss
smith </s>
<s> i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my
existencenever paid her any attentions but as your friend </s>
<s>  never
cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend </s>
<s>  if she
has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very
sorryextremely sorrybut miss smith indeed </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse </s>
<s> 
who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near </s>
<s>  no upon my
honour there is no unsteadiness of character </s>
<s>  i have thought only of
you </s>
<s>  i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one
else </s>
<s>  every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has
been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself </s>
<s>  you

<s>  no </s>
<s> in an accent meant to be
insinuatingi am sure you have seen and understood me </s>
<s> 

it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing thiswhich
of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost </s>
<s>  she was too completely
overpowered to be immediately able to reply </s>
<s>  and two moments of silence
being ample encouragement for <abvr> eltons sanguine state of mind he
tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed

charming miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  allow me to interpret this interesting
silence </s>
<s>  it confesses that you have long understood me </s>
<s> 

no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing </s>
<s>  so far from having

very earnestly wishing you success </s>
<s>  but had i supposed that she were not
your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged
ill in making your visits so frequent </s>
<s>  am i to believe that you have
never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith </s>

have never thought seriously of her </s>
<s> 

never madam cried he affronted in his turn </s>

<s>

<s> miss smith is a very good sort of
girl </s>
<s>  and i should be happy to see her respectably settled </s>

her extremely well </s>
<s>  and no doubt there are men who might not object
toevery body has their level </s>
<s>  but as for myself i am not i think
quite so much at a loss </s>
<s>  i need not so totally despair of an equal
alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith </s>
<s> no madam my
visits to hartfield have been for yourself only </s>

received

<s> i give you encouragement </s>
<s> sir you have been entirely
mistaken in supposing it </s>

friend </s>
<s>  in no other light could you have been more to me than a common
acquaintance </s>
<s>  i am exceedingly sorry </s>
<s>  but it is well that the mistake
ends where it does </s>
<s>  had the same behaviour continued miss smith might
have been led into a misconception of your views </s>

probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you
are so sensible of </s>
<s>  but as it is the disappointment is single and i
trust will not be lasting </s>
<s>  i have no thoughts of matrimony at present </s>
<s> 

he was too angry to say another word </s>
<s>  her manner too decided to invite
supplication </s>
<s>  and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually
deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer
for the fears of <abvr> woodhouse had confined them to a footpace </s>

awkwardness </s>

little zigzags of embarrassment </s>

turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves
all at once at the door of his house </s>

syllable passed </s>

night </s>
<s>  the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly </s>
<s>  and under
indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield </s>
<s> 

there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who
had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage
laneturning a corner which he could never bear to think ofand in
strange handsa mere common coachmanno james </s>

attention </s>

father as to seemif not quite ready to join him in a basin of
gruelperfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome </s>
<s>  and the
day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party

it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the

chapter xvi


the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think
and be miserable </s>
<s> it was a wretched business indeed </s>
<s> such an overthrow
of every thing she had been wishing for </s>
<s> such a development of every
thing most unwelcome </s>
<s> such a blow for harriet </s>
<s> that was the worst
of all </s>
<s>  every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or
other </s>
<s>  but compared with the evil to harriet all was light </s>
<s>  and
she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistakenmore in
errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she actually was could the
effects of her blunders have been confined to herself </s>
<s> 

if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have
borne any thing </s>
<s>  he might have doubled his presumption to mebut poor
harriet </s>
<s> 

how she could have been so deceived </s>
<s> he protested that he had never
thought seriously of harrietnever </s>
<s>  she looked back as well as
she could </s>
<s>  but it was all confusion </s>
<s>  she had taken up the idea she
supposed and made every thing bend to it </s>
<s>  his manners however must
have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so
misled </s>
<s> 

the picture </s>
<s> how eager he had been about the picture </s>
<s> and the
charade </s>
<s> and an hundred other circumstances </s>
<s> how clearly they had
seemed to point at harriet </s>
<s>  to be sure the charade with its ready
witbut then the soft eyesin fact it suited neither </s>
<s>  it was
a jumble without taste or truth </s>
<s>  who could have seen through such
thickheaded nonsense </s>
<s> 

certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to
herself unnecessarily gallant </s>
<s>  but it had passed as his way as a mere
error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others
that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the
gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting </s>
<s>  but
till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean
any thing but grateful respect to her as harriets friend </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the
subject for the first start of its possibility </s>
<s>  there was no denying
that those brothers had penetration </s>
<s>  she remembered what <abvr> knightley
had once said to her about <abvr> elton the caution he had given
the conviction he had professed that <abvr> elton would never marry
indiscreetly </s>
<s>  and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his
character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself </s>
<s>  it
was dreadfully mortifying </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton was proving himself in many
respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him </s>
<s> 
proud assuming conceited </s>
<s>  very full of his own claims and little
concerned about the feelings of others </s>
<s> 

contrary to the usual course of things <abvr> eltons wanting to pay his
addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion </s>
<s>  his professions and his
proposals did him no service </s>
<s>  she thought nothing of his attachment
and was insulted by his hopes </s>
<s>  he wanted to marry well and having the
arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love </s>
<s>  but she was
perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be
cared for </s>
<s>  there had been no real affection either in his language or
manners </s>
<s>  sighs and fine words had been given in abundance </s>
<s>  but she could
hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less
allied with real love </s>
<s>  she need not trouble herself to pity him </s>
<s>  he
only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself </s>
<s>  and if miss woodhouse
of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so
easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody
else with twenty or with ten </s>
<s> 

butthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware
of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry
him </s>
<s> should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind </s>
<s> look down
upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below
him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no
presumption in addressing her </s>
<s> it was most provoking </s>
<s> 

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her
inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind </s>
<s>  the very want of
such equality might prevent his perception of it </s>
<s>  but he must know that
in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior </s>
<s>  he must
know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at
hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient familyand that the
eltons were nobody </s>
<s>  the landed property of hartfield certainly was
inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate
to which all the rest of highbury belonged </s>
<s>  but their fortune from
other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell
abbey itself in every other kind of consequence </s>
<s>  and the woodhouses had
long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which
mr </s>
<s>  elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he
could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him
to notice but his situation and his civility </s>
<s> but he had fancied her
in love with him </s>
<s>  that evidently must have been his dependence </s>
<s>  and
after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners
and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop
and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and
obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real
motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and
delicacy like <abvr> elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite </s>
<s> 
if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to
wonder that he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken
hers </s>

the first error and the worst lay at her door </s>
<s>  it was foolish it was
wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together </s>

was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what
ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple </s>
<s>  she was quite
concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more </s>
<s> 

here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very
much attached to this man </s>

me </s>

she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more
serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be
and must be </s>
<s>  the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and
all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of
future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the
acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding
eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some
time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the
conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully </s>

to youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under temporary
gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of
spirits </s>

to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of
softened pain and brighter hope </s>
<s> 

emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone
to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to
depend on getting tolerably out of it </s>
<s> 

it was a great consolation that <abvr> elton should not be really in
love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to
disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that superior
sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentiveand that there
could be no necessity for any bodys knowing what had passed except the
three principals and especially for her fathers being given a moments
uneasiness about it </s>
<s> 

these were very cheering thoughts </s>
<s>  and the sight of a great deal of snow
on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that
might justify their all three being quite asunder at present </s>
<s> 

the weather was most favourable for her </s>
<s>  though christmas day she
could not go to church </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse would have been miserable had his
daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting
or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas </s>
<s>  the ground covered
with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and
thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every
morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to
freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner </s>
<s>  no intercourse
with harriet possible but by note </s>
<s>  no church for her on sunday any
more than on christmas day </s>
<s>  and no need to find excuses for <abvr> eltons
absenting himself </s>
<s> 

it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home </s>
<s>  and though
she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society
or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with
his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out </s>
<s>  and to
hear him say to <abvr> knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from
them

ah </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley why do not you stay at home like poor <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

these days of confinement would have been but for her private
perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited
her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to
his companions </s>
<s>  and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his
illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the
rest of his stay at hartfield </s>
<s>  he was always agreeable and obliging
and speaking pleasantly of every body </s>
<s>  but with all the hopes of
cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such
an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as
made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease </s>

chapter xvii


mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> john knightley were not detained long at hartfield </s>
<s>  the
weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay
behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party
set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor
isabella </s>
<s> which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated
on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently
busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness </s>
<s> 

the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from <abvr>
elton to <abvr> woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with
mr </s>
<s>  eltons best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury
the following morning in his way to bath </s>
<s>  where in compliance with
the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few
weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from
various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal
leave of <abvr> woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever
retain a grateful senseand had <abvr> woodhouse any commands should be
happy to attend to them </s>
<s> 

emma was most agreeably surprized </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  eltons absence just at this
time was the very thing to be desired </s>
<s>  she admired him for contriving
it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it
was announced </s>
<s>  resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than
in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded </s>
<s> 
she had not even a share in his opening compliments </s>
<s> her name was not
mentioned </s>
<s> and there was so striking a change in all this and such an
illjudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments as
she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion </s>
<s> 

it did however </s>
<s> her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so
sudden a journey and his fears that <abvr> elton might never get safely to
the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language </s>
<s>  it was a
very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought
and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse
talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away
with all her usual promptitude </s>
<s> 

she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark </s>
<s>  she had reason
to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that
she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of
her other complaint before the gentlemans return </s>
<s>  she went to <abvr>
goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary
penance of communication </s>
<s>  and a severe one it was </s>
<s> she had to destroy
all the hopes which she had been so industriously feedingto appear in
the ungracious character of the one preferredand acknowledge herself
grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her ideas on one subject all
her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last
six weeks </s>
<s> 

the confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight of
harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity with
herself again </s>
<s> 

harriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobodyand in every
thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion
of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to
her friend </s>
<s> 

emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost </s>
<s> 
and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on
harriets side not her own </s>
<s>  harriet did not consider herself as having
any thing to complain of </s>
<s>  the affection of such a man as <abvr> elton
would have been too great a distinction </s>
<s> she never could have deserved
himand nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would
have thought it possible </s>
<s> 

her tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless that
no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyesand
she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and
understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was the
superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would be more for
her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could
do </s>
<s> 

it was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded and
ignorant </s>
<s>  but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of
being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of
her life </s>
<s>  her second duty now inferior only to her fathers claims was
to promote harriets comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection
in some better method than by matchmaking </s>
<s>  she got her to hartfield
and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and
amuse her and by books and conversation to drive <abvr> elton from her
thoughts </s>
<s> 

time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done </s>
<s>  and
she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in
general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to <abvr> elton
in particular </s>
<s>  but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age
and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be
made towards a state of composure by the time of <abvr> eltons return as
to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them </s>
<s> 

harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence
of any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth
prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen </s>
<s>  but yet
it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an
inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its
continuing very long in equal force </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and
indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not
imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the
recollection of him </s>
<s> 

their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for
each for all three </s>
<s>  not one of them had the power of removal or of
effecting any material change of society </s>
<s>  they must encounter each
other and make the best of it </s>
<s> 

harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at <abvr>
goddards </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great
girls in the school </s>
<s>  and it must be at hartfield only that she could
have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or
repellent truth </s>
<s>  where the wound had been given there must the cure be
found if anywhere </s>
<s>  and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of
cure there could be no true peace for herself </s>

chapter xviii


mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill did not come </s>
<s>  when the time proposed drew near <abvr>
westons fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse </s>
<s>  for
the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification
and regret </s>
<s>  but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to
randalls at no distant period </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed in
fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man
had been so much more sober </s>
<s>  but a sanguine temper though for ever
expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by
any proportionate depression </s>
<s>  it soon flies over the present failure
and begins to hope again </s>
<s>  for half an hour <abvr> weston was surprized and
sorry </s>
<s>  but then he began to perceive that franks coming two or three
months later would be a much better plan </s>
<s>  better time of year </s>
<s> 
better weather </s>
<s>  and that he would be able without any doubt to stay
considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner </s>
<s> 

these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while <abvr> weston of
a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of
excuses and delays </s>
<s>  and after all her concern for what her husband was
to suffer suffered a great deal more herself </s>
<s> 

emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about <abvr>
frank churchills not coming except as a disappointment at randalls </s>
<s> 
the acquaintance at present had no charm for her </s>
<s>  she wanted rather to
be quiet and out of temptation </s>
<s>  but still as it was desirable that she
should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express
as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into <abvr>
and <abvr> westons disappointment as might naturally belong to their
friendship </s>
<s> 

she was the first to announce it to <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and exclaimed quite
as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather
more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away </s>
<s>  she then
proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of
such an addition to their confined society in surry </s>
<s>  the pleasure of
looking at somebody new </s>
<s>  the galaday to highbury entire which the
sight of him would have made </s>
<s>  and ending with reflections on the
churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement
with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and to her great amusement perceived that she was
taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making
use of <abvr> westons arguments against herself </s>
<s> 

the churchills are very likely in fault said <abvr> knightley coolly </s>
<s> 
but i dare say he might come if he would </s>
<s> 

i do not know why you should say so </s>
<s>  he wishes exceedingly to come </s>
<s>  but
his uncle and aunt will not spare him </s>
<s> 

i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a
point of it </s>
<s>  it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof </s>
<s> 

how odd you are </s>
<s>  what has <abvr> frank churchill done to make you suppose
him such an unnatural creature </s>
<s> 

i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that
he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little
for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have
always set him the example of it </s>
<s>  it is a great deal more natural than
one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud
luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too </s>
<s>  if
frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it
between september and january </s>
<s>  a man at his agewhat is he </s>
<s> three or
fourandtwentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that </s>
<s> 
it is impossible </s>
<s> 

thats easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your
own master </s>
<s>  you are the worst judge in the world <abvr> knightley of the
difficulties of dependence </s>
<s>  you do not know what it is to have tempers
to manage </s>
<s> 

it is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount </s>
<s>  he cannot want
moneyhe cannot want leisure </s>
<s>  we know on the contrary that he has so
much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in
the kingdom </s>
<s>  we hear of him for ever at some wateringplace or other </s>
<s>  a
little while ago he was at weymouth </s>
<s>  this proves that he can leave the
churchills </s>
<s> 

yes sometimes he can </s>
<s> 

and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while </s>
<s>  whenever
there is any temptation of pleasure </s>
<s> 

it is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an intimate
knowledge of their situation </s>
<s>  nobody who has not been in the interior
of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that
family may be </s>
<s>  we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with <abvr>
churchills temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew
can do </s>
<s>  he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at
others </s>
<s> 

there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and
that is his duty </s>
<s>  not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and
resolution </s>
<s>  it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention to his
father </s>
<s>  he knows it to be so by his promises and messages </s>
<s>  but if he
wished to do it it might be done </s>
<s>  a man who felt rightly would say at
once simply and resolutely to <abvr> churchill˜every sacrifice of
mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience </s>
<s> 
but i must go and see my father immediately </s>
<s>  i know he would be hurt by
my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion </s>
<s> 
i shall therefore set off tomorrow </s>
<s> if he would say so to her
at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no
opposition made to his going </s>
<s> 

no said emma laughing </s>
<s>  but perhaps there might be some made to his
coming back again </s>
<s>  such language for a young man entirely dependent to
use </s>
<s> nobody but you <abvr> knightley would imagine it possible </s>
<s>  but you
have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to
your own </s>
<s>  <abvr> frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to
the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for
him </s>
<s> standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as
loud as he could </s>
<s> how can you imagine such conduct practicable </s>
<s> 

depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it </s>
<s>  he
would feel himself in the right </s>
<s>  and the declarationmade of course
as a man of sense would make it in a proper mannerwould do him more
good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he
depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do </s>
<s> 
respect would be added to affection </s>
<s>  they would feel that they could
trust him </s>
<s>  that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do
rightly by them </s>
<s>  for they know as well as he does as well as all the
world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father </s>
<s>  and
while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not
thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims </s>
<s>  respect for
right conduct is felt by every body </s>
<s>  if he would act in this sort of
manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would
bend to his </s>
<s> 

i rather doubt that </s>
<s>  you are very fond of bending little minds </s>
<s>  but
where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have
a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great
ones </s>
<s>  i can imagine that if you as you are <abvr> knightley were to be
transported and placed all at once in <abvr> frank churchills situation
you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for
him </s>
<s>  and it might have a very good effect </s>
<s>  the churchills might not have
a word to say in return </s>
<s>  but then you would have no habits of early
obedience and long observance to break through </s>
<s>  to him who has it might
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set
all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought </s>
<s>  he may have as
strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so
equal under particular circumstances to act up to it </s>
<s> 

then it would not be so strong a sense </s>
<s>  if it failed to produce equal
exertion it could not be an equal conviction </s>
<s> 

oh the difference of situation and habit </s>
<s>  i wish you would try to
understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly
opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his
life </s>
<s> 

our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the
will of others </s>
<s>  it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of
following his duty instead of consulting expediency </s>
<s>  i can allow for
the fears of the child but not of the man </s>
<s>  as he became rational he
ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in
their authority </s>
<s>  he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their
side to make him slight his father </s>
<s>  had he begun as he ought there
would have been no difficulty now </s>
<s> 

we shall never agree about him cried emma </s>
<s>  but that is nothing
extraordinary </s>
<s>  i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man </s>
<s> 
i feel sure that he is not </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would not be blind to folly
though in his own son </s>
<s>  but he is very likely to have a more yielding
complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of mans
perfection </s>
<s>  i dare say he has </s>
<s>  and though it may cut him off from some
advantages it will secure him many others </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and
of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely
expert in finding excuses for it </s>
<s>  he can sit down and write a fine
flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade
himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of
preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers having any right to
complain </s>
<s>  his letters disgust me </s>
<s> 

your feelings are singular </s>
<s>  they seem to satisfy every body else </s>
<s> 

i suspect they do not satisfy <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  they hardly can satisfy
a woman of her good sense and quick feelings </s>
<s>  standing in a mothers
place but without a mothers affection to blind her </s>
<s>  it is on her
account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly
feel the omission </s>
<s>  had she been a person of consequence herself he
would have come i dare say </s>
<s>  and it would not have signified whether
he did or no </s>
<s>  can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of
considerations </s>
<s>  do you suppose she does not often say all this to
herself </s>
<s>  no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french
not in english </s>
<s>  he may be very ˜amiable have very good manners and be
very agreeable </s>
<s>  but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings
of other people </s>
<s>  nothing really amiable about him </s>
<s> 

you seem determined to think ill of him </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> not at all replied <abvr> knightley rather displeased </s>
<s>  i do not
want to think ill of him </s>
<s>  i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits
as any other man </s>
<s>  but i hear of none except what are merely personal </s>
<s> 
that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth plausible manners </s>
<s> 

well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure
at highbury </s>
<s>  we do not often look upon fine young men wellbred and
agreeable </s>
<s>  we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the
bargain </s>
<s>  cannot you imagine <abvr> knightley what a sensation his
coming will produce </s>
<s>  there will be but one subject throughout the
parishes of donwell and highbury </s>
<s>  but one interestone object of
curiosity </s>
<s>  it will be all <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  we shall think and speak
of nobody else </s>
<s> 

you will excuse my being so much overpowered </s>
<s>  if i find him
conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance </s>
<s>  but if he is only a
chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts </s>
<s> 

my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of
every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally
agreeable </s>
<s>  to you he will talk of farming </s>
<s>  to me of drawing or music </s>
<s> 
and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects
which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as
propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each </s>
<s>  that is my
idea of him </s>
<s> 

and mine said <abvr> knightley warmly is that if he turn out any
thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing </s>

at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great manthe
practised politician who is to read every bodys character and make

fools compared with himself </s>
<s>  my dear emma your own good sense could not
endure such a puppy when it came to the point </s>

evil </s>
<s>  we are both prejudiced </s>
<s>  you against i for him </s>

prejudiced </s>

<s> 

he is a person i never think of from one months end to another said
mr </s>
<s>  knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately
talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be
angry </s>
<s> 

to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a
different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of
mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him </s>
<s>  for with all the
high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had
never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit
of another </s>

emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emmas
opinion had been talking enough of <abvr> elton for that day </s>

not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more </s>

always sufficient reason for such an attention </s>

loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few
who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in
that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of
their scanty comforts </s>

she had had many a hint from <abvr> knightley and some from her own heart
as to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome womenand
all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate and
thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore
she seldom went near them </s>

passing their door without going inobserving as she proposed it to

the favour to eat a piece too </s>

this she had been prepared for when she entered the house </s>
<s>  but meant
having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by
any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses
and misses of highbury and their cardparties </s>
<s>  she had not been
prepared to have jane fairfax succeed <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  but he was actually
hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to
the coles to usher in a letter from her niece </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesmr </s>
<s>  elton i understandcertainly as to dancingmrs </s>
<s>  cole
was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath wasmrs </s>
<s>  cole was so
kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane </s>
<s>  for as soon as
she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a
favourite there </s>
<s>  whenever she is with us <abvr> cole does not know how to
shew her kindness enough </s>
<s>  and i must say that jane deserves it as much
as any body can </s>
<s>  and so she began inquiring after her directly saying
˜i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her
time for writing </s>
<s>  and when i immediately said ˜but indeed we have we
had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body
more surprized </s>
<s>  ˜have you upon your honour </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  ˜well that is
quite unexpected </s>
<s>  do let me hear what she says </s>
<s> 

emmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest

have you heard from miss fairfax so lately </s>
<s>  i am extremely happy </s>
<s>  i
hope she is well </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  you are so kind </s>
<s>  replied the happily deceived aunt while
eagerly hunting for the letter </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  here it is </s>
<s>  i was sure it could
not be far off </s>
<s>  but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being
aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately
that i was almost sure it must be on the table </s>
<s>  i was reading it to <abvr>
cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for
it is such a pleasure to hera letter from janethat she can never
hear it often enough </s>
<s>  so i knew it could not be far off and here it is
only just under my huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear
what she says </s>
<s> but first of all i really must in justice to
jane apologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you
seehardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses
half </s>
<s>  my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well </s>
<s>  she often
says when the letter is first opened ˜well hetty now i think
you will be put to it to make out all that checkerworkdont you
maam </s>
<s> and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out
herself if she had nobody to do it for herevery word of iti am sure
she would pore over it till she had made out every word </s>
<s>  and indeed
though my mothers eyes are not so good as they were she can see
amazingly well still thank god </s>
<s>  with the help of spectacles </s>
<s>  it is such
a blessing </s>
<s>  my mothers are really very good indeed </s>
<s>  jane often says
when she is here ˜i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong
eyes to see as you doand so much fine work as you have done too </s>
<s> i
only wish my eyes may last me as well </s>
<s> 

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath </s>
<s> 
and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss
fairfaxs handwriting </s>
<s> 

you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified </s>
<s>  you who
are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself </s>
<s>  i am sure there is
nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouses </s>
<s> 
my mother does not hear </s>
<s>  she is a little deaf you know </s>
<s>  maam
 addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say
about janes handwriting </s>
<s> 

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated
twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it </s>
<s>  she was
pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very
rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had almost
resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss
bates turned to her again and seized her attention </s>
<s> 

my mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all </s>
<s>  by
only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over
she is sure to hear </s>
<s>  but then she is used to my voice </s>
<s>  but it is very
remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me </s>
<s> 
jane speaks so distinct </s>
<s>  however she will not find her grandmama at all
deafer than she was two years ago </s>
<s>  which is saying a great deal at my
mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years you know since
she was here </s>
<s>  we never were so long without seeing her before and as
i was telling <abvr> cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her
now </s>

are you expecting miss fairfax here soon </s>

oh yes </s>

<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> that must be a very great pleasure </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  you are very kind </s>
<s>  yes next week </s>
<s>  every body is so
surprized </s>
<s>  and every body says the same obliging things </s>
<s>  i am sure she
will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see
her </s>
<s>  yes friday or saturday </s>
<s>  she cannot say which because colonel
campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days </s>
<s>  so very
good of them to send her the whole way </s>
<s>  but they always do you know </s>
<s>  oh
yes friday or saturday next </s>
<s>  that is what she writes about </s>
<s>  that is
the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it </s>
<s>  for in the
common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or
wednesday </s>
<s> 

yes so i imagined </s>
<s>  i was afraid there could be little chance of my
hearing any thing of miss fairfax today </s>
<s> 

so obliging of you </s>
<s>  no we should not have heard if it had not been
for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon </s>
<s>  my
mother is so delighted </s>
<s> for she is to be three months with us at
least </s>
<s>  three months she says so positively as i am going to have the
pleasure of reading to you </s>
<s>  the case is you see that the campbells are
going to ireland </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come
over and see her directly </s>
<s>  they had not intended to go over till the
summer but she is so impatient to see them againfor till she married
last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must
make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say
but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter
to her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was but
we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in <abvr> dixons name as
well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would
give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country
seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy </s>
<s>  jane has heard a great
deal of its beauty </s>
<s>  from <abvr> dixon i meani do not know that she ever
heard about it from any body else </s>
<s>  but it was very natural you know
that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his
addressesand as jane used to be very often walking out with themfor
colonel and <abvr> campbell were very particular about their daughters
not walking out often with only <abvr> dixon for which i do not at all
blame them </s>
<s>  of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss
campbell about his own home in ireland </s>
<s>  and i think she wrote us word
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had
taken himself </s>
<s>  he is a most amiable charming young man i believe </s>
<s>  jane
was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things </s>
<s> 

at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmas
brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming <abvr> dixon and the
not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther
discovery

you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to
come to you at such a time </s>
<s>  considering the very particular friendship
between her and <abvr> dixon you could hardly have expected her to be
excused from accompanying colonel and <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 

very true very true indeed </s>
<s>  the very thing that we have always been
rather afraid of </s>
<s>  for we should not have liked to have her at such a
distance from us for months togethernot able to come if any thing was
to happen </s>
<s>  but you see every thing turns out for the best </s>
<s>  they want
her <abvr> and <abvr> dixon excessively to come over with colonel and <abvr>
campbell </s>
<s>  quite depend upon it </s>
<s>  nothing can be more kind or pressing
than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention </s>
<s>  he is
a most charming young man </s>
<s>  ever since the service he rendered jane at
weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the
sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have
been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he
had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit
i can never think of it without trembling </s>
<s> but ever since we had the
history of that day i have been so fond of <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing
ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and <abvr> bates </s>
<s> 

yesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice </s>
<s>  and colonel
and <abvr> campbell think she does quite right just what they should
recommend </s>
<s>  and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native
air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately </s>
<s> 

i am concerned to hear of it </s>
<s>  i think they judge wisely </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
dixon must be very much disappointed </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon i understand has
no remarkable degree of personal beauty </s>
<s>  is not by any means to be
compared with miss fairfax </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not </s>
<s> 
there is no comparison between them </s>
<s>  miss campbell always was absolutely
plainbut extremely elegant and amiable </s>
<s> 

yes that of course </s>
<s> 

jane caught a bad cold poor thing </s>
<s>  so long ago as the th of november
as i am going to read to you and has never been well since </s>
<s>  a long
time is not it for a cold to hang upon her </s>
<s>  she never mentioned
it before because she would not alarm us </s>
<s>  just like her </s>
<s>  so
considerate </s>
<s> but however she is so far from well that her kind
friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air
that always agrees with her </s>
<s>  and they have no doubt that three or four
months at highbury will entirely cure herand it is certainly a great
deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is
unwell </s>
<s>  nobody could nurse her as we should do </s>
<s> 

it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world </s>
<s> 

and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells
leave town in their way to holyhead the monday followingas you will
find from janes letter </s>
<s>  so sudden </s>
<s> you may guess dear miss woodhouse
what a flurry it has thrown me in </s>
<s>  if it was not for the drawback of
her illnessbut i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and
looking very poorly </s>
<s>  i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to
me as to that </s>
<s>  i always make a point of reading janes letters through
to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for
fear of there being any thing in them to distress her </s>
<s>  jane desired me
to do it so i always do </s>
<s>  and so i began today with my usual caution </s>
<s> 
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i
burst out quite frightened with ˜bless me </s>
<s>  poor jane is ill </s>
<s> which
my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed
at </s>
<s>  however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had
fancied at first </s>
<s>  and i make so light of it now to her that she does
not think much about it </s>
<s>  but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my
guard </s>
<s>  if jane does not get well soon we will call in <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  the
expense shall not be thought of </s>
<s>  and though he is so liberal and so
fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for
attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know </s>
<s>  he has a wife and
family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time </s>
<s>  well now i
have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to
her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better
than i can tell it for her </s>
<s> 

i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet
and beginning to risemy father will be expecting us </s>
<s>  i had no
intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes
when i first entered the house </s>
<s>  i merely called because i would not
pass the door without inquiring after <abvr> bates </s>
<s>  but i have been so
pleasantly detained </s>
<s>  now however we must wish you and <abvr> bates good
morning </s>
<s> 

and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded </s>
<s>  she regained
the streethappy in this that though much had been forced on her
against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of
jane fairfaxs letter she had been able to escape the letter itself </s>

chapter ii


jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of <abvr> batess youngest
daughter </s>
<s> 

the marriage of lieut </s>
<s>  fairfax of the regiment of infantry
and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope
and interest </s>
<s>  but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy
remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under
consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl </s>
<s> 

by birth she belonged to highbury </s>
<s>  and when at three years old on
losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation
the foundling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every
probability of her being permanently fixed there </s>
<s>  of her being taught
only what very limited means could command and growing up with no
advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what
nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and
warmhearted wellmeaning relations </s>
<s> 

but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change
to her destiny </s>
<s>  this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded
fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man </s>
<s>  and
farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe
campfever as he believed had saved his life </s>
<s>  these were claims which
he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the
death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in
his power </s>
<s>  when he did return he sought out the child and took notice
of her </s>
<s>  he was a married man with only one living child a girl about
janes age </s>
<s>  and jane became their guest paying them long visits and
growing a favourite with all </s>
<s>  and before she was nine years old his
daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real
friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking
the whole charge of her education </s>
<s>  it was accepted </s>
<s>  and from that period
jane had belonged to colonel campbells family and had lived with them
entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time </s>
<s> 

the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others </s>
<s>  the
very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making
independence impossible </s>
<s>  to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel
campbells power </s>
<s>  for though his income by pay and appointments was
handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughters </s>
<s> 
but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of
respectable subsistence hereafter </s>
<s> 

such was jane fairfaxs history </s>
<s>  she had fallen into good hands known
nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent
education </s>
<s>  living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people
her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline
and culture </s>
<s>  and colonel campbells residence being in london every
lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of
firstrate masters </s>
<s>  her disposition and abilities were equally worthy
of all that friendship could do </s>
<s>  and at eighteen or nineteen she was
as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children
fully competent to the office of instruction herself </s>
<s>  but she was too
much beloved to be parted with </s>
<s>  neither father nor mother could promote
and the daughter could not endure it </s>
<s>  the evil day was put off </s>
<s>  it was
easy to decide that she was still too young </s>
<s>  and jane remained with
them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of
an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with
only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own
good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over </s>
<s> 

the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss
campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from
the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty and
acquirements </s>
<s>  that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen
by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the
parents </s>
<s>  they continued together with unabated regard however till the
marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often
defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is
moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of
mr </s>
<s>  dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were
acquainted </s>
<s>  and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had
yet her bread to earn </s>
<s> 

this event had very lately taken place </s>
<s>  too lately for any thing to be
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path
of duty </s>
<s>  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had
fixed on for beginning </s>
<s>  she had long resolved that oneandtwenty
should be the period </s>
<s>  with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had
resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from
all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace
and hope to penance and mortification for ever </s>
<s> 

the good sense of colonel and <abvr> campbell could not oppose such
a resolution though their feelings did </s>
<s>  as long as they lived no
exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever </s>
<s>  and for
their own comfort they would have retained her wholly </s>
<s>  but this would
be selfishness </s>
<s> what must be at last had better be soon </s>
<s>  perhaps they
began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the
temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments
of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished </s>
<s>  still however
affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying
on the wretched moment </s>
<s>  she had never been quite well since the time of
their daughters marriage </s>
<s>  and till she should have completely recovered
her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so
far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits
seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with
tolerable comfort </s>
<s> 

with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her
aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths
not told </s>
<s>  it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to
highbury </s>
<s>  to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with
those kind relations to whom she was so very dear </s>
<s>  and the campbells
whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or
treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they
depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery
of her health than on any thing else </s>
<s>  certain it was that she was to
come </s>
<s>  and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
had been so long promised itmr </s>
<s>  frank churchillmust put up for the
present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two
years absence </s>
<s> 

emma was sorry </s>
<s> to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like
through three long months </s>
<s> to be always doing more than she wished
and less than she ought </s>
<s>  why she did not like jane fairfax might be a
difficult question to answer </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had once told her it was
because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she
wanted to be thought herself </s>
<s>  and though the accusation had been eagerly
refuted at the time there were moments of selfexamination in which
her conscience could not quite acquit her </s>
<s>  but she could never get
acquainted with her </s>
<s>  she did not know how it was but there was such
coldness and reservesuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or
notand then her aunt was such an eternal talker </s>
<s> and she was made
such a fuss with by every body </s>
<s> and it had been always imagined that
they were to be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every
body had supposed they must be so fond of each other </s>
<s>  these were her
reasonsshe had no better </s>
<s> 

it was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified
by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any
considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her </s>
<s>  and
now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years
interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and
manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating </s>
<s>  jane
fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant </s>
<s>  and she had herself the
highest value for elegance </s>
<s>  her height was pretty just such as almost
every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall </s>
<s>  her
figure particularly graceful </s>
<s>  her size a most becoming medium between
fat and thin though a slight appearance of illhealth seemed to point
out the likeliest evil of the two </s>
<s>  emma could not but feel all this </s>
<s>  and
then her faceher featuresthere was more beauty in them altogether
than she had remembered </s>
<s>  it was not regular but it was very pleasing
beauty </s>
<s>  her eyes a deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had
never been denied their praise </s>
<s>  but the skin which she had been used to
cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really
needed no fuller bloom </s>
<s>  it was a style of beauty of which elegance was
the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her
principles admire it </s>
<s> elegance which whether of person or of mind
she saw so little in highbury </s>
<s>  there not to be vulgar was distinction
and merit </s>
<s> 

in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with
twofold complacency </s>
<s>  the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering
justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer </s>
<s>  when
she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty </s>
<s> 
when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was
going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible
to feel any thing but compassion and respect </s>
<s>  especially if to every
wellknown particular entitling her to interest were added the highly
probable circumstance of an attachment to <abvr> dixon which she had
so naturally started to herself </s>
<s>  in that case nothing could be more
pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on </s>
<s> 
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced <abvr> dixons
actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination
had suggested at first </s>
<s>  if it were love it might be simple single
successless love on her side alone </s>
<s>  she might have been unconsciously
sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her
friend </s>
<s>  and from the best the purest of motives might now be
denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself
effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of
laborious duty </s>
<s> 

upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings
as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence </s>
<s>  nobody that she
could wish to scheme about for her </s>
<s> 

these were charming feelingsbut not lasting </s>
<s>  before she had committed
herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax
or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than
saying to <abvr> knightley she certainly is handsome </s>
<s>  she is better than
handsome </s>
<s>  jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother
and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state </s>
<s> 
former provocations reappeared </s>
<s>  the aunt was as tiresome as ever </s>
<s>  more
tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration
of her powers </s>
<s>  and they had to listen to the description of exactly how
little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice
of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new
workbags for her mother and herself </s>
<s>  and janes offences rose again </s>
<s> 
they had music </s>
<s>  emma was obliged to play </s>
<s>  and the thanks and praise
which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an
air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very
superior performance </s>
<s>  she was besides which was the worst of all so
cold so cautious </s>
<s>  there was no getting at her real opinion </s>
<s>  wrapt up in
a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing </s>
<s>  she was
disgustingly was suspiciously reserved </s>
<s> 

if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on
the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing </s>
<s>  she seemed bent
on giving no real insight into <abvr> dixons character or her own value
for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match </s>
<s>  it was all
general approbation and smoothness </s>
<s>  nothing delineated or distinguished </s>
<s> 
it did her no service however </s>
<s>  her caution was thrown away </s>
<s>  emma saw
its artifice and returned to her first surmises </s>
<s>  there probably was
something more to conceal than her own preference </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon perhaps
had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only
to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

the like reserve prevailed on other topics </s>
<s>  she and <abvr> frank churchill
had been at weymouth at the same time </s>
<s>  it was known that they were a
little acquainted </s>
<s>  but not a syllable of real information could emma
procure as to what he truly was </s>
<s>  was he handsome </s>
<s> she believed
he was reckoned a very fine young man </s>
<s>  was he agreeable </s>
<s> he was
generally thought so </s>
<s>  did he appear a sensible young man </s>
<s>  a young
man of information </s>
<s> at a wateringplace or in a common london
acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points </s>
<s>  manners were
all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than
they had yet had of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  she believed every body found his
manners pleasing </s>
<s>  emma could not forgive her </s>
<s> 



chapter iii


emma could not forgive her </s>
<s> but as neither provocation nor resentment
were discerned by <abvr> knightley who had been of the party and had
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was
expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse his approbation of the whole </s>
<s>  not so openly as he might
have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough
to be very intelligible to emma </s>
<s>  he had been used to think her unjust to
jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement </s>
<s> 

a very pleasant evening he began as soon as <abvr> woodhouse had been
talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers
swept away </s>
<s> particularly pleasant </s>
<s>  you and miss fairfax gave us some
very good music </s>
<s>  i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting

<s> 
sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation </s>
<s>  i am sure miss
fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma </s>
<s>  you left nothing
undone </s>
<s>  i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument
at her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence </s>
<s> 

i am happy you approved said emma smiling </s>

often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield </s>
<s> 

no my dear said her father instantly </s>

<s> 
there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are </s>
<s>  if any thing
you are too attentive </s>

my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her
you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant
evening </s>

oh </s>
<s>  no </s>

i am disappointed was his only answer </s>

i hope every body had a pleasant evening said <abvr> woodhouse in his
quiet way </s>

<s>  once i felt the fire rather too much </s>

moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me </s>

miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured as she always is though
she speaks rather too quick </s>
<s>  however she is very agreeable and <abvr>
bates too in a different way </s>

agreeable <abvr> knightley because she had emma </s>

true sir </s>

emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the

mr </s>

great pity indeed </s>

it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is not like any other
porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma unless one could be sure

the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast
porki think we had better send the legdo not you think so my dear </s>

my dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter </s>

there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and

thats right my dear very right </s>

that is the best way </s>

is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle
boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a

emma said <abvr> knightley presently i have a piece of news for you </s>

he had time only to say

mr </s>

emma had not had time even to think of <abvr> elton and she was so

there is my news </s>

but where could you hear it </s>

afraid that we had not any saltingpan large enough </s>

my dear said iwell and just then came the note </s>

how could you possibly have heard it </s>
<s>  for the very moment <abvr> cole told

i was with <abvr> cole on business an hour and a half ago </s>

<s> 

we consider our hartfield pork replied <abvr> woodhouseindeed it
certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot
have a greater pleasure than

<s>  my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good
to us </s>
<s>  if ever there were people who without having great wealth
themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us </s>

we may well say that ˜our lot is cast in a goodly heritage </s>

knightley and so you actually saw the letter </s>
<s>  well

it was shortmerely to announcebut cheerful exulting of course </s>
<s> 
here was a sly glance at emma </s>
<s>  he had been so fortunate as toi forget
the precise wordsone has no business to remember them </s>
<s>  the information
was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins </s>
<s>  by
his style i should imagine it just settled </s>
<s> 

mr </s>

<s>  said emma as soon as she could speak </s>

he will have every bodys wishes for his happiness </s>
<s> 

he is very young to settle was <abvr> woodhouses observation </s>

better not be in a hurry </s>

<s>  we
were always glad to see him at hartfield </s>

a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse </s>

my mother is so pleased </s>
<s> she says she cannot bear to have the poor old
vicarage without a mistress </s>
<s>  this is great news indeed </s>
<s>  jane you have
never seen <abvr> elton </s>
<s> no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see
him </s>

janes curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to
occupy her </s>

noi have never seen <abvr> elton she replied starting on this appeal </s>

who shall answer that question </s>

<s>  my father would say
˜yes <abvr> knightley ˜no </s>

<s>  when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax
you will understand that <abvr> elton is the standard of perfection in
highbury both in person and mind </s>

her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my

hear quite quick </s>

<s>  he
fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bathbut she says it did
him no lasting benefit </s>
<s>  colonel campbell you know is quite our angel </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him </s>
<s>  it
is such a happiness when good people get togetherand they always do </s>
<s> 
now here will be <abvr> elton and miss hawkins </s>
<s>  and there are the coles
such very good people </s>

highbury </s>

sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is
porka roast loin of pork

as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted
with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known </s>
<s>  one feels that it
cannot be a very long acquaintance </s>
<s>  he has been gone only four weeks </s>
<s> 

nobody had any information to give </s>
<s>  and after a few more wonderings
emma said

you are silent miss fairfaxbut i hope you mean to take an interest
in this news </s>
<s>  you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late
on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss
campbells accountwe shall not excuse your being indifferent about <abvr>
elton and miss hawkins </s>
<s> 

when i have seen <abvr> elton replied jane i dare say i shall be
interestedbut i believe it requires that with me </s>
<s>  and as it is some
months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn
off </s>
<s> 

yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse
 said miss bates four weeks yesterday </s>
<s> a miss hawkins </s>
<s> well i had
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts </s>
<s>  not that
i evermrs </s>

elton is a most worthy young manbutin short i do not think i am
particularly quick at those sort of discoveries </s>

what is before me i see </s>
<s>  at the same time nobody could wonder if

my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain
and that you yourself

oh </s>
<s>  as for me my judgment is worth nothing </s>

i always think a person welllooking </s>

well my dear jane i believe we must be running away </s>

not look well and grandmama will be uneasy </s>

dear miss woodhouse </s>

but i shall not stop three minutes </s>

directlyi would not have you out in a shower </s>

better for highbury already </s>

<s>  elton and miss hawkins </s>
<s> good
morning to you </s>
<s> 

emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while
he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marryand to
marry strangers tooand the other half she could give to her own view
of the subject </s>
<s>  it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece
of news as proving that <abvr> elton could not have suffered long </s>
<s>  but she
was sorry for harriet </s>
<s>  harriet must feel itand all that she could hope
was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing
it abruptly from others </s>
<s>  it was now about the time that she was likely
to call </s>
<s>  if she were to meet miss bates in her way </s>
<s> and upon its
beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would
be detaining her at <abvr> goddards and that the intelligence would
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation </s>
<s> 

the shower was heavy but short </s>
<s>  and it had not been over five minutes
when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give </s>
<s>  and the oh </s>
<s>  miss
woodhouse what do you think has happened </s>
<s>  which instantly burst forth
had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation </s>
<s>  as the blow was
given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in
listening </s>
<s>  and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to
tell </s>
<s>  she had set out from <abvr> goddards half an hour agoshe had
been afraid it would rainshe had been afraid it would pour down
every momentbut she thought she might get to hartfield firstshe
had hurried on as fast as possible </s>
<s>  but then as she was passing by the
house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she
would just step in and see how it went on </s>
<s>  and though she did not seem
to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain
and she did not know what to do </s>
<s>  so she ran on directly as fast as
she could and took shelter at fords </s>
<s> fords was the principal
woollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united </s>
<s>  the shop
first in size and fashion in the place </s>
<s> and so there she had
set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes
perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come into be sure it was
so very odd </s>
<s> but they always dealt at fordswho should come in but
elizabeth martin and her brother </s>
<s> dear miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s>  i
thought i should have fainted </s>
<s>  i did not know what to do </s>
<s>  i was sitting
near the doorelizabeth saw me directly </s>
<s>  but he did not </s>
<s>  he was busy
with the umbrella </s>
<s>  i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly
and took no notice </s>
<s>  and they both went to quite the farther end of the
shop </s>
<s>  and i kept sitting near the door </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  dear </s>
<s>  i was so miserable </s>
<s> 
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown </s>
<s>  i could not go away
you know because of the rain </s>
<s>  but i did so wish myself anywhere in the
world but there </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhousewell at last i fancy he
looked round and saw me </s>
<s>  for instead of going on with her buyings they
began whispering to one another </s>
<s>  i am sure they were talking of me </s>
<s>  and
i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to medo
you think he was miss woodhouse </s>
<s> for presently she came forwardcame
quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands
if i would </s>
<s>  she did not do any of it in the same way that she used </s>
<s>  i
could see she was altered </s>
<s>  but however she seemed to try to be very
friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time </s>
<s>  but i know no
more what i saidi was in such a tremble </s>
<s> i remember she said she
was sorry we never met now </s>
<s>  which i thought almost too kind </s>
<s>  dear miss
woodhouse i was absolutely miserable </s>
<s>  by that time it was beginning to
hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting
awayand thenonly think </s>
<s> i found he was coming up towards me
tooslowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do </s>
<s>  and
so he came and spoke and i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling
dreadfully you know one cant tell how </s>
<s>  and then i took courage and
said it did not rain and i must go </s>
<s>  and so off i set </s>
<s>  and i had not got
three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was
going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by <abvr> coles
stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
dear i thought it would have been the death of me </s>
<s>  so i said i was
very much obliged to him </s>
<s>  you know i could not do less </s>
<s>  and then he went
back to elizabeth and i came round by the stablesi believe i didbut
i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse
i would rather done any thing than have it happen </s>
<s>  and yet you know
there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and
so kindly </s>
<s>  and elizabeth too </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse do talk to me and
make me comfortable again </s>
<s> 

very sincerely did emma wish to do so </s>
<s>  but it was not immediately in
her power </s>
<s>  she was obliged to stop and think </s>
<s>  she was not thoroughly
comfortable herself </s>
<s>  the young mans conduct and his sisters seemed
the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them </s>
<s>  as harriet
described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection
and genuine delicacy in their behaviour </s>
<s>  but she had believed them to be
wellmeaning worthy people before </s>
<s>  and what difference did this make
in the evils of the connexion </s>
<s>  it was folly to be disturbed by it </s>
<s>  of
course he must be sorry to lose herthey must be all sorry </s>
<s>  ambition
as well as love had probably been mortified </s>
<s>  they might all have hoped
to rise by harriets acquaintance </s>
<s>  and besides what was the value of
harriets description </s>
<s> so easily pleasedso little discerning </s>
<s> what
signified her praise </s>
<s> 

she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering
all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt
on

it might be distressing for the moment said she </s>
<s>  but you seem to
have behaved extremely well </s>
<s>  and it is overand may nevercan never
as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about
it </s>
<s> 

harriet said very true and she would not think about it </s>
<s>  but still
she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else </s>
<s>  and emma at
last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry
on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution </s>
<s> 
hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only
amused at such a state of mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of
mr </s>
<s>  eltons importance with her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  eltons rights however gradually revived </s>
<s>  though she did not feel
the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour
before its interest soon increased </s>
<s>  and before their first conversation
was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity
wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins
which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in
her fancy </s>
<s> 

emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting </s>
<s>  it
had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any
influence to alarm </s>
<s>  as harriet now lived the martins could not get
at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the
courage or the condescension to seek her </s>
<s>  for since her refusal of the
brother the sisters never had been at <abvr> goddards </s>
<s>  and a twelvemonth
might pass without their being thrown together again with any
necessity or even any power of speech </s>

chapter iv


human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting
situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of
being kindly spoken of </s>
<s> 

a week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first mentioned in
highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have
every recommendation of person and mind </s>
<s>  to be handsome elegant highly
accomplished and perfectly amiable </s>
<s>  and when <abvr> elton himself arrived
to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits
there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian
name and say whose music she principally played </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton returned a very happy man </s>
<s>  he had gone away rejected and
mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what
appeared to him strong encouragement </s>
<s>  and not only losing the right
lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one </s>
<s>  he
had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged to anotherand
to another as superior of course to the first as under such
circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost </s>
<s>  he came back gay
and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse
and defying miss smith </s>
<s> 

the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of
perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune
of so many thousands as would always be called ten </s>
<s>  a point of some
dignity as well as some convenience </s>
<s>  the story told well </s>
<s>  he had not
thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of  l </s>
<s>  or thereabouts </s>
<s> 
and he had gained her with such delightful rapiditythe first hour of
introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice </s>
<s> 
the history which he had to give <abvr> cole of the rise and progress
of the affair was so gloriousthe steps so quick from the accidental
rencontre to the dinner at <abvr> greens and the party at <abvr>
brownssmiles and blushes rising in importancewith consciousness and
agitation richly scatteredthe lady had been so easily impressedso
sweetly disposedhad in short to use a most intelligible phrase
been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally
contented </s>
<s> 

he had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection and
was just the happy man he ought to be </s>
<s>  talking only of himself and
his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed
atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young
ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more
cautiously gallant </s>
<s> 

the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to
please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for </s>
<s>  and
when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which
a certain glance of <abvr> coles did not seem to contradict that when he
next entered highbury he would bring his bride </s>
<s> 

during his present short stay emma had barely seen him </s>
<s>  but just enough
to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression
of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now
spread over his air </s>
<s>  she was in fact beginning very much to wonder
that she had ever thought him pleasing at all </s>
<s>  and his sight was so
inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that
except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable
humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured
of never seeing him again </s>
<s>  she wished him very well </s>
<s>  but he gave
her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most
satisfaction </s>
<s> 

the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must
certainly be lessened by his marriage </s>
<s>  many vain solicitudes would be
preventedmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it </s>
<s>  a <abvr> elton would
be an excuse for any change of intercourse </s>
<s>  former intimacy might sink
without remark </s>
<s>  it would be almost beginning their life of civility
again </s>
<s> 

of the lady individually emma thought very little </s>
<s>  she was good enough
for <abvr> elton no doubt </s>
<s>  accomplished enough for highburyhandsome
enoughto look plain probably by harriets side </s>
<s>  as to connexion
there emma was perfectly easy </s>
<s>  persuaded that after all his own vaunted
claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing </s>
<s>  on that article
truth seemed attainable </s>
<s>  what she was must be uncertain </s>
<s>  but who
she was might be found out </s>
<s>  and setting aside the  l </s>
<s>  it did not
appear that she was at all harriets superior </s>
<s>  she brought no name no
blood no alliance </s>
<s>  miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters
of a bristolmerchant of course he must be called </s>
<s>  but as the whole
of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it
was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very
moderate also </s>
<s>  part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath </s>
<s> 
but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol </s>
<s>  for though the
father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remainedin the law
linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than
that he was in the law line </s>
<s>  and with him the daughter had lived </s>
<s>  emma
guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise </s>
<s> 
and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder
sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great
way near bristol who kept two carriages </s>
<s>  that was the windup of the
history </s>
<s>  that was the glory of miss hawkins </s>
<s> 

could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all </s>
<s>  she had
talked her into love </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  she was not so easily to be talked out
of it </s>
<s>  the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriets
mind was not to be talked away </s>

certainly would indeed </s>
<s>  nothing could be clearer </s>
<s>  even a robert martin
would have been sufficient </s>
<s>  but nothing else she feared would cure
her </s>
<s>  harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always
in love </s>

reappearance of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  she was always having a glimpse of him
somewhere or other </s>
<s>  emma saw him only once </s>
<s>  but two or three times every
day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him

surprize and conjecture </s>
<s>  she was moreover perpetually hearing about
him </s>
<s>  for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who
saw no fault in <abvr> elton and found nothing so interesting as
the discussion of his concerns </s>
<s>  and every report therefore every
guessall that had already occurred all that might occur in the
arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and
furniture was continually in agitation around her </s>
<s>  her regard was
receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept
alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss
hawkinss happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed
attached </s>

hat being all in proof of how much he was in love </s>

had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her
friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriets mind
emma would have been amused by its variations </s>
<s>  sometimes <abvr> elton
predominated sometimes the martins </s>
<s>  and each was occasionally useful
as a check to the other </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons engagement had been the cure of
the agitation of meeting <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  the unhappiness produced by the
knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth
martins calling at <abvr> goddards a few days afterwards </s>
<s>  harriet had
not been at home </s>
<s>  but a note had been prepared and left for her written
in the very style to touch </s>
<s>  a small mixture of reproach with a great
deal of kindness </s>
<s>  and till <abvr> elton himself appeared she had been much
occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton in
person had driven away all such cares </s>
<s>  while he staid the martins were
forgotten </s>
<s>  and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again
emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best
for her to return elizabeth martins visit </s>
<s> 

how that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessaryand
what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration </s>
<s> 
absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would
be ingratitude </s>

acquaintance </s>
<s> 

after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than
harriets returning the visit </s>
<s>  but in a way that if they had
understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal
acquaintance </s>
<s>  she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the
abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again
so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous
recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree
of intimacy was chosen for the future </s>

she could think of nothing better </s>

chapter v


small heart had harriet for visiting </s>
<s>  only half an hour before her
friend called for her at <abvr> goddards her evil stars had led her
to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to the rev </s>
<s> 
philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the operation of
being lifted into the butchers cart which was to convey it to where
the coaches past </s>
<s>  and every thing in this world excepting that trunk
and the direction was consequently a blank </s>
<s> 

she went however </s>
<s>  and when they reached the farm and she was to be
put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between
espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every thing which
had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to
revive a little local agitation </s>
<s>  and when they parted emma observed her
to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined
her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour </s>
<s> 
she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who
was married and settled in donwell </s>
<s> 

the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again </s>
<s> 
and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and
unattended by any alarming young man </s>
<s>  she came solitarily down the
gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with
her seemingly with ceremonious civility </s>
<s> 

harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account </s>
<s>  she was
feeling too much </s>
<s>  but at last emma collected from her enough to
understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating </s>
<s> 
she had seen only <abvr> martin and the two girls </s>
<s>  they had received her
doubtingly if not coolly </s>
<s>  and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had
been talked almost all the timetill just at last when <abvr> martins
saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had
brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner </s>
<s>  in that very
room she had been measured last september with her two friends </s>
<s>  there
were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window </s>
<s> 
he had done it </s>
<s>  they all seemed to remember the day the hour
the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness the same
regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding </s>
<s>  and they
were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect
as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage
reappeared and all was over </s>
<s>  the style of the visit and the shortness
of it were then felt to be decisive </s>
<s>  fourteen minutes to be given
to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months
ago </s>
<s> emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might
resent how naturally harriet must suffer </s>
<s>  it was a bad business </s>
<s>  she
would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had
the martins in a higher rank of life </s>
<s>  they were so deserving that a
little higher should have been enough </s>
<s>  but as it was how could she
have done otherwise </s>
<s> impossible </s>
<s> she could not repent </s>
<s>  they must be
separated </s>
<s>  but there was a great deal of pain in the processso much
to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little
consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to
procure it </s>
<s>  her mind was quite sick of <abvr> elton and the martins </s>
<s>  the
refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary </s>
<s> 

it was a good scheme </s>
<s>  but on driving to the door they heard that neither
master nor mistress was at home </s>
<s>  they had both been out some time </s>
<s>  the
man believed they were gone to hartfield </s>
<s> 

this is too bad cried emma as they turned away </s>
<s>  and now we shall
just miss them </s>
<s>  too provoking </s>
<s> i do not know when i have been so
disappointed </s>
<s>  and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her
murmurs or to reason them away </s>
<s>  probably a little of bothsuch being
the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind </s>
<s>  presently the carriage
stopt </s>
<s>  she looked up </s>
<s>  it was stopt by <abvr> and <abvr> weston who were
standing to speak to her </s>
<s>  there was instant pleasure in the sight of
them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in soundfor <abvr> weston
immediately accosted her with

how dye do </s>
<s> how dye do </s>
<s> we have been sitting with your fatherglad
to see him so well </s>
<s>  frank comes tomorrowi had a letter this
morningwe see him tomorrow by dinnertime to a certaintyhe is at
oxford today and he comes for a whole fortnight </s>

<s>  now we are going to have
just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather </s>
<s>  we shall
enjoy him completely </s>
<s>  every thing has turned out exactly as we could
wish </s>
<s> 

there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the
influence of such a happy face as <abvr> westons confirmed as it all was
by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not
less to the purpose </s>
<s>  to know that she thought his coming certain was
enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in
their joy </s>
<s>  it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits </s>
<s> 
the wornout past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming </s>
<s>  and in
the rapidity of half a moments thought she hoped <abvr> elton would now
be talked of no more </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which
allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command
as well as the route and the method of his journey </s>
<s>  and she listened
and smiled and congratulated </s>
<s> 

i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion </s>
<s> 

emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his
wife </s>
<s> 

we had better move on <abvr> weston said she we are detaining the
girls </s>
<s> 

well well i am ready </s>
<s> and turning again to emma but you must
not be expecting such a very fine young man </s>
<s>  you have only
had my account you know </s>
<s>  i dare say he is really nothing
extraordinary </s>
<s> though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were
speaking a very different conviction </s>
<s> 

emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a
manner that appropriated nothing </s>
<s>

westons parting injunction </s>
<s>  spoken with some anxiety and meant only
for her </s>
<s> 

four oclock </s>
<s> depend upon it he will be here by three was <abvr>
westons quick amendment </s>
<s>  and so ended a most satisfactory meeting </s>
<s> 
emmas spirits were mounted quite up to happiness </s>
<s>  every thing wore
a different air </s>
<s>  james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as
before </s>
<s>  when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least
must soon be coming out </s>
<s>  and when she turned round to harriet she saw
something like a look of spring a tender smile even there </s>
<s> 

will <abvr> frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford </s>
<s> was a
question however which did not augur much </s>
<s> 

but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma
was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time </s>
<s> 

the morning of the interesting day arrived and <abvr> westons faithful
pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve oclock that
she was to think of her at four </s>
<s> 

my dear dear anxious friendsaid she in mental soliloquy while
walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every
bodys comfort but your own </s>
<s>  i see you now in all your little fidgets
going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right </s>
<s> 
 the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall </s>
<s>  ˜tis twelve </s>
<s> 
i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence </s>
<s>  and by this
time tomorrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the
possibility of their all calling here </s>
<s>  i am sure they will bring him
soon </s>
<s> 

she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her
fathermr </s>
<s>  weston and his son </s>
<s>  they had been arrived only a few
minutes and <abvr> weston had scarcely finished his explanation of franks
being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his
very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her
share of surprize introduction and pleasure </s>
<s> 

the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually
before herhe was presented to her and she did not think too much had
been said in his praise </s>
<s>  he was a very good looking young man </s>
<s>  height
air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great
deal of the spirit and liveliness of his fathers </s>
<s>  he looked quick and
sensible </s>
<s>  she felt immediately that she should like him </s>
<s>  and there was
a wellbred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her
that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted
they soon must be </s>
<s> 

he had reached randalls the evening before </s>
<s>  she was pleased with the
eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel
earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day </s>
<s> 

i told you yesterday cried <abvr> weston with exultation i told you
all that he would be here before the time named </s>
<s>  i remembered what i
used to do myself </s>
<s>  one cannot creep upon a journey </s>
<s>  one cannot help
getting on faster than one has planned </s>
<s>  and the pleasure of coming in
upon ones friends before the lookout begins is worth a great deal
more than any little exertion it needs </s>
<s> 

it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young
man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far </s>
<s> 
but in coming home i felt i might do any thing </s>
<s> 

the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency </s>
<s> 
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable </s>
<s>  the
conviction was strengthened by what followed </s>
<s>  he was very much pleased
with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly
allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to
highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself
to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but
ones own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it </s>
<s>  that
he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before
passed suspiciously through emmas brain </s>
<s>  but still if it were a
falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled </s>
<s>  his manner had
no air of study or exaggeration </s>
<s>  he did really look and speak as if in a
state of no common enjoyment </s>
<s> 

their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening
acquaintance </s>
<s>  on his side were the inquirieswas she a
horsewoman </s>
<s> pleasant rides </s>
<s> pleasant walks </s>
<s> had they a large
neighbourhood </s>
<s> highbury perhaps afforded society enough </s>
<s> there were
several very pretty houses in and about it </s>
<s> ballshad they balls </s>
<s> was
it a musical society </s>
<s> 

but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while
their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his
motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much
warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his
father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional
proof of his knowing how to pleaseand of his certainly thinking it
worth while to try to please her </s>
<s>  he did not advance a word of praise
beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  but
undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter </s>
<s>  he understood
what would be welcome </s>
<s>  he could be sure of little else </s>
<s>  his fathers
marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must
rejoice in it </s>
<s>  and the family from whom he had received such a blessing
must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on
him </s>
<s> 

he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it
was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses
character than miss woodhouse miss taylors </s>
<s>  and at last as if
resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its
object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of
her person </s>
<s> 

elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he </s>
<s>  but i
confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a
very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age </s>
<s>  i did not know that
i was to find a pretty young woman in <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

you cannot see too much perfection in <abvr> weston for my feelings
 said emma </s>
<s>  were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with
pleasure </s>
<s>  but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such
words </s>
<s>  dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty
young woman </s>
<s> 

i hope i should know better he replied </s>
<s>  no depend upon it with a
gallant bow that in addressing <abvr> weston i should understand whom
i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my
terms </s>
<s> 

emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from
their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind
had ever crossed his </s>
<s>  and whether his compliments were to be considered
as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance </s>
<s>  she must see more
of him to understand his ways </s>
<s>  at present she only felt they were
agreeable </s>
<s> 

she had no doubt of what <abvr> weston was often thinking about </s>
<s>  his quick
eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy
expression </s>
<s>  and even when he might have determined not to look she was
confident that he was often listening </s>
<s> 

her own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the
entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion
was a most comfortable circumstance </s>
<s>  happily he was not farther from
approving matrimony than from foreseeing it </s>
<s> though always objecting
to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from
the apprehension of any </s>
<s>  it seemed as if he could not think so ill of
any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it
were proved against them </s>
<s>  she blessed the favouring blindness </s>
<s>  he could
now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a
glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all
his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous inquiries after <abvr>
frank churchills accommodation on his journey through the sad evils
of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed
anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching coldwhich
however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till
after another night </s>
<s> 

a reasonable visit paid <abvr> weston began to move </s>
<s> he must be going </s>
<s> 
he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for
mrs </s>
<s>  weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else </s>
<s>  his son
too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying

as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity
of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore
may as well be paid now </s>
<s>  i have the honour of being acquainted with
a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near
highbury </s>
<s>  a family of the name of fairfax </s>
<s>  i shall have no difficulty
i suppose in finding the house </s>
<s>  though fairfax i believe is not
the proper namei should rather say barnes or bates </s>
<s>  do you know any
family of that name </s>
<s> 

to be sure we do cried his father </s>
<s>  <abvr> bateswe passed her
housei saw miss bates at the window </s>
<s>  true true you are acquainted
with miss fairfax </s>
<s>  i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl
she is </s>
<s>  call upon her by all means </s>
<s> 

there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man </s>
<s> 
another day would do as well </s>
<s>  but there was that degree of acquaintance
at weymouth which

oh </s>
<s>  go today go today </s>
<s>  do not defer it </s>
<s>  what is right to be done
cannot be done too soon </s>
<s>  and besides i must give you a hint frank </s>
<s> 
any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided </s>
<s>  you saw
her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed
with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough
to live on </s>
<s>  if you do not call early it will be a slight </s>
<s> 

the son looked convinced </s>
<s> 

i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma </s>
<s>  she is a very
elegant young woman </s>
<s> 

he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to
doubt his real concurrence </s>
<s>  and yet there must be a very distinct sort
of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought
only ordinarily gifted with it </s>
<s> 

if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she
i think you will today </s>
<s>  you will see her to advantage </s>
<s>  see her and
hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an
aunt who never holds her tongue </s>
<s> 

you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation </s>
<s>  then give
me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young
lady </s>
<s>  she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very
worthy people </s>
<s>  i have known them all my life </s>
<s>  they will be extremely
glad to see you i am sure </s>
<s>  and one of my servants shall go with you to
shew you the way </s>
<s> 

my dear sir upon no account in the world </s>
<s>  my father can direct me </s>
<s> 

but your father is not going so far </s>
<s>  he is only going to the crown
quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many
houses </s>
<s>  you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk
unless you keep on the footpath </s>
<s>  but my coachman can tell you where you
had best cross the street </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend
this is quite unnecessary </s>
<s>  frank knows a puddle of water when he sees
it and as to <abvr> batess he may get there from the crown in a hop
step and jump </s>
<s> 

they were permitted to go alone </s>
<s>  and with a cordial nod from one and a
graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave </s>
<s>  emma remained
very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now
engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full
confidence in their comfort </s>

chapter vi


the next morning brought <abvr> frank churchill again </s>
<s>  he came with <abvr>
weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially </s>
<s>  he had
been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till
her usual hour of exercise </s>
<s>  and on being desired to chuse their walk
immediately fixed on highbury </s>
<s> he did not doubt there being very
pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always
chuse the same </s>
<s>  highbury that airy cheerful happylooking highbury
would be his constant attraction </s>
<s> highbury with <abvr> weston stood
for hartfield </s>
<s>  and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with
him </s>
<s>  they walked thither directly </s>
<s> 

emma had hardly expected them </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston who had called in for
half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew
nothing of their plans </s>
<s>  and it was an agreeable surprize to her
therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in
arm </s>
<s>  she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in
company with <abvr> weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him
was to depend </s>
<s>  if he were deficient there nothing should make amends
for it </s>
<s>  but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied </s>
<s>  it
was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his
duty </s>
<s>  nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to
hernothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as
a friend and securing her affection </s>
<s>  and there was time enough for emma
to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of
the morning </s>
<s>  they were all three walking about together for an hour
or twofirst round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards
in highbury </s>
<s>  he was delighted with every thing </s>
<s>  admired hartfield
sufficiently for <abvr> woodhouses ear </s>
<s>  and when their going farther was
resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole
village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than
emma could have supposed </s>
<s> 

some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings </s>
<s>  he
begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and
which had been the home of his fathers father </s>
<s>  and on recollecting that
an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of
her cottage from one end of the street to the other </s>
<s>  and though in
some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they
shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general which must
be very like a merit to those he was with </s>
<s> 

emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it
could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting
himself </s>
<s>  that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of
insincere professions </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> knightley certainly had not done him
justice </s>
<s> 

their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though
the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of posthorses
were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any
run on the road </s>
<s>  and his companions had not expected to be detained by
any interest excited there </s>
<s>  but in passing it they gave the history of
the large room visibly added </s>
<s>  it had been built many years ago for
a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly
populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such </s>
<s> but such
brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for
which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established
among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place </s>
<s>  he was immediately
interested </s>
<s>  its character as a ballroom caught him </s>
<s>  and instead of
passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed
windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities
and lament that its original purpose should have ceased </s>
<s>  he saw no fault
in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested </s>
<s>  no it
was long enough broad enough handsome enough </s>
<s>  it would hold the
very number for comfort </s>
<s>  they ought to have balls there at least every
fortnight through the winter </s>
<s>  why had not miss woodhouse revived
the former good old days of the room </s>
<s> she who could do any thing in
highbury </s>
<s>  the want of proper families in the place and the conviction
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted
to attend were mentioned </s>
<s>  but he was not satisfied </s>
<s>  he could not be
persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw around him could
not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting </s>
<s>  and even when particulars
were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that
the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there
would be the smallest difficulty in every bodys returning into their
proper place the next morning </s>
<s>  he argued like a young man very much bent
on dancing </s>
<s>  and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of
the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills </s>
<s> 
he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social
inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of
enscombe </s>
<s>  of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough </s>
<s>  his
indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of
mind </s>
<s>  he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap </s>
<s> 
it was but an effusion of lively spirits </s>
<s> 

at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown </s>
<s> 
and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma
recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had
paid it </s>
<s> 

yes oh </s>
<s>  yeshe replied </s>
<s>  i was just going to mention it </s>
<s>  a very
successful visit </s>
<s> i saw all the three ladies </s>
<s>  and felt very much
obliged to you for your preparatory hint </s>
<s>  if the talking aunt had taken
me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me </s>
<s>  as it was i
was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit </s>
<s>  ten minutes
would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper </s>
<s>  and
i had told my father i should certainly be at home before himbut there
was no getting away no pause </s>
<s>  and to my utter astonishment i found
when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had
been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour </s>
<s> 
the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before </s>
<s> 

and how did you think miss fairfax looking </s>
<s> 

ill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look
ill </s>
<s>  but the expression is hardly admissible <abvr> weston is it </s>
<s>  ladies
can never look ill </s>
<s>  and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so
pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health </s>
<s> a most
deplorable want of complexion </s>
<s> 

emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfaxs
complexion </s>
<s>  it was certainly never brilliant but she would not

delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of
her face </s>
<s>  he listened with all due deference </s>
<s>  acknowledged that he had
heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess that to him
nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health </s>
<s>  where
features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all </s>

and where they were good the effect wasfortunately he need not
attempt to describe what the effect was </s>
<s> 

well said emma there is no disputing about taste </s>
<s> at least you
admire her except her complexion </s>
<s> 

he shook his head and laughed </s>
<s> i cannot separate miss fairfax and her
complexion </s>
<s> 

did you see her often at weymouth </s>
<s>  were you often in the same society </s>
<s> 

at this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed
ha </s>
<s>  this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of
their lives as my father informs me </s>
<s>  he comes to highbury himself he
says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords </s>

if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove
myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury </s>

buy something at fords </s>

they sell gloves </s>

they went in </s>
<s>  and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers

<s>  do not let me lose it </s>
<s>  i assure you the utmost stretch of
public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in

<s> 

i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her
party at weymouth </s>
<s> 

and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a
very unfair one </s>
<s>  it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree
of acquaintance </s>

<s> i
shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow </s>
<s> 

upon my word </s>
<s>  you answer as discreetly as she could do herself </s>
<s>  but
her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very
reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any
body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance
with her </s>
<s> 

may i indeed </s>
<s> then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so
well </s>
<s>  i met her frequently at weymouth </s>

you get upon delicate subjects emma said <abvr> weston smiling </s>

farther off </s>

i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend </s>

he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment </s>

you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play </s>

churchill </s>

she plays charmingly </s>

you think so do you </s>

could really judge </s>
<s>  she appeared to me to play well that is with
considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself </s>
<s> i am
excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right
of judging of any bodys performance </s>

admired </s>

<s> a
man a very musical man and in love with another womanengaged to

that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof </s>

proof indeed </s>

<s>  dixon is very musical
is he </s>
<s>  we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you

yes <abvr> dixon and miss campbell were the persons </s>
<s>  and i thought it a
very strong proof </s>

certainlyvery strong it was </s>
<s>  to own the truth a great deal stronger
than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable
to me </s>
<s>  i could not excuse a mans having more music than lovemore ear

<s> 
how did miss campbell appear to like it </s>
<s> 

it was her very particular friend you know </s>
<s> 

poor comfort </s>
<s>  said emma laughing </s>
<s>  one would rather have a stranger
preferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might

<s> poor
mrs </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s>  well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland </s>
<s> 

you are right </s>
<s>  it was not very flattering to miss campbell </s>
<s>  but she
really did not seem to feel it </s>
<s> 

so much the betteror so much the worse </s>
<s> i do not know which </s>
<s>  but
be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship or
dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have felt
it </s>
<s>  miss fairfax herself </s>
<s>  she must have felt the improper and dangerous
distinction </s>

as to thati do not

oh </s>
<s>  do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs
sensations from you or from any body else </s>
<s>  they are known to no human
being i guess but herself </s>
<s>  but if she continued to play whenever she

<s> 

there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all
 he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is
impossible for me to say on what terms they really werehow it might
all be behind the scenes </s>
<s>  i can only say that there was smoothness
outwardly </s>
<s>  but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be
a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct
herself in critical situations than i can be </s>
<s> 

i have known her from a child undoubtedly </s>
<s>  we have been children
and women together </s>
<s>  and it is natural to suppose that we should be
intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever she visited
her friends </s>
<s>  but we never did </s>
<s>  i hardly know how it has happened </s>
<s>  a
little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take
disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was
by her aunt and grandmother and all their set </s>
<s>  and then her reservei
never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved </s>
<s> 

it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he </s>
<s>  oftentimes very
convenient no doubt but never pleasing </s>
<s>  there is safety in reserve
but no attraction </s>
<s>  one cannot love a reserved person </s>
<s> 

not till the reserve ceases towards oneself </s>
<s>  and then the attraction
may be the greater </s>
<s>  but i must be more in want of a friend or an
agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of
conquering any bodys reserve to procure one </s>
<s>  intimacy between miss
fairfax and me is quite out of the question </s>
<s>  i have no reason to think
ill of hernot the leastexcept that such extreme and perpetual
cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea
about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to
conceal </s>
<s> 

he perfectly agreed with her </s>
<s>  and after walking together so long and
thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting </s>
<s>  he was
not exactly what she had expected </s>
<s>  less of the man of the world in some
of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better
than she had expected </s>
<s>  his ideas seemed more moderatehis feelings
warmer </s>
<s>  she was particularly struck by his manner of considering <abvr>
eltons house which as well as the church he would go and look at
and would not join them in finding much fault with </s>
<s>  no he could not
believe it a bad house </s>
<s>  not such a house as a man was to be pitied for
having </s>
<s>  if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not
think any man to be pitied for having that house </s>

room in it for every real comfort </s>

wanted more </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about </s>
<s> 
used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no
judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one </s>
<s>  but emma
in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking
about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in
life and to marry from worthy motives </s>
<s>  he might not be aware of the
inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeepers room or
a bad butlers pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe
could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would
willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment </s>

chapter vii


emmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the
following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have
his hair cut </s>
<s>  a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and
he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner
but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut </s>
<s> 
there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over
on such an errand </s>
<s>  but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it
which she could not approve </s>
<s>  it did not accord with the rationality of
plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart
which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday </s>
<s>  vanity
extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be
doing something good or bad </s>
<s>  heedlessness as to the pleasure of his
father and <abvr> weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear
in general </s>
<s>  he became liable to all these charges </s>
<s>  his father only
called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story </s>
<s>  but that <abvr>
weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as
quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young
people would have their little whims </s>
<s> 

with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made
himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether </s>
<s>  he
appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful and
lively one </s>
<s>  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal
decidedly right </s>
<s>  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of
talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the world if he were
left to himself </s>
<s>  and though there was no being attached to the aunt he
acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to
speak of her with respect </s>
<s>  this was all very promising </s>
<s>  and but for
such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to
denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination
had given him </s>
<s>  the honour if not of being really in love with her
of being at least very near it and saved only by her own
indifferencefor still her resolution held of never marryingthe
honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must
have some weight </s>
<s>  he gave her to understand that frank admired her
extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming </s>
<s>  and with so
much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him
harshly </s>
<s>  as <abvr> weston observed all young people would have their
little whims </s>
<s> 

there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so
leniently disposed </s>
<s>  in general he was judged throughout the parishes of
donwell and highbury with great candour </s>
<s>  liberal allowances were made
for the little excesses of such a handsome young manone who smiled so
often and bowed so well </s>
<s>  but there was one spirit among them not to be
softened from its power of censure by bows or smilesmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> 
the circumstance was told him at hartfield </s>
<s>  for the moment he was
silent </s>
<s>  but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself
over a newspaper he held in his hand hum </s>
<s>  just the trifling silly
fellow i took him for </s>
<s>  she had half a mind to resent </s>
<s>  but an instants
observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his
own feelings and not meant to provoke </s>
<s>  and therefore she let it pass </s>
<s> 

although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  westons visit this morning was in another respect particularly
opportune </s>
<s>  something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma
want their advice </s>
<s>  and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly
the advice they gave </s>
<s> 

this was the occurrence </s>
<s> the coles had been settled some years in
highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal and
unpretending </s>
<s>  but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade
and only moderately genteel </s>
<s>  on their first coming into the country
they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little
company and that little unexpensively </s>
<s>  but the last year or two had
brought them a considerable increase of meansthe house in town had
yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them </s>
<s>  with
their wealth their views increased </s>
<s>  their want of a larger house their
inclination for more company </s>
<s>  they added to their house to their number
of servants to their expenses of every sort </s>
<s>  and by this time were
in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield </s>
<s> 
their love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body
for their keeping dinnercompany </s>
<s>  and a few parties chiefly among the
single men had already taken place </s>
<s>  the regular and best families emma
could hardly suppose they would presume to inviteneither donwell nor
hartfield nor randalls </s>
<s>  nothing should tempt her to go if they did </s>
<s> 
and she regretted that her fathers known habits would be giving
her refusal less meaning than she could wish </s>
<s>  the coles were very
respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not
for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit
them </s>
<s>  this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from
herself </s>
<s>  she had little hope of <abvr> knightley none of <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks
before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her
very differently affected </s>
<s>  donwell and randalls had received their
invitation and none had come for her father and herself </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
westons accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the
liberty with you </s>
<s>  they know you do not dine out was not quite
sufficient </s>
<s>  she felt that she should like to have had the power of
refusal </s>
<s>  and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there
consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred
again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted
to accept </s>
<s>  harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses </s>
<s>  they
had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before
and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence </s>
<s>  might
not the evening end in a dance </s>
<s>  had been a question of his </s>
<s>  the bare
possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits </s>
<s>  and
her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be
intended as a compliment was but poor comfort </s>
<s> 

it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at
hartfield which made their presence so acceptable </s>
<s>  for though her first
remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so
very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their
advice for her going was most prompt and successful </s>
<s> 

she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely
without inclination for the party </s>
<s>  the coles expressed themselves so
properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of itso much
consideration for her father </s>
<s>  they would have solicited the honour
earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen from
london which they hoped might keep <abvr> woodhouse from any draught of
air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour
of his company </s>
<s>  upon the whole she was very persuadable </s>
<s>  and it being
briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting
his comforthow certainly <abvr> goddard if not <abvr> bates might be
depended on for bearing him companymr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was to be talked
into an acquiescence of his daughters going out to dinner on a day now
near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him </s>
<s>  as for his
going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be
too late and the party too numerous </s>
<s>  he was soon pretty well resigned </s>
<s> 

i am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was </s>
<s>  no more is
emma </s>
<s>  late hours do not agree with us </s>
<s>  i am sorry <abvr> and <abvr> cole
should have done it </s>
<s>  i think it would be much better if they would come
in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with ustake us
in their afternoon walk </s>
<s>  which they might do as our hours are so
reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the
evening </s>
<s>  the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any
body to </s>
<s>  however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine
with them and as you will both be there and <abvr> knightley too to take
care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what
it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy </s>
<s>  then turning to <abvr>
weston with a look of gentle reproachah </s>
<s>  miss taylor if you had not
married you would have staid at home with me </s>
<s> 

well sir cried <abvr> weston as i took miss taylor away it is
incumbent on me to supply her place if i can </s>
<s>  and i will step to <abvr>
goddard in a moment if you wish it </s>
<s> 

but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing
not lessening <abvr> woodhouses agitation </s>
<s>  the ladies knew better how
to allay it </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately
arranged </s>
<s> 

with this treatment <abvr> woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking
as usual </s>
<s>  he should be happy to see <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  he had a great regard
for <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  and emma should write a line and invite her </s>
<s>  james
could take the note </s>
<s>  but first of all there must be an answer written
to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible </s>
<s>  you will say
that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline
their obliging invitation </s>
<s>  beginning with my compliments of course </s>
<s> 
but you will do every thing right </s>

done </s>
<s>  we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be
wanted on tuesday </s>
<s>  i shall have no fears for you with him </s>
<s>  we have never
been there above once since the new approach was made </s>
<s>  but still i have
no doubt that james will take you very safely </s>
<s>  and when you get there
you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again </s>
<s> 
and you had better name an early hour </s>
<s>  you will not like staying late </s>
<s> 
you will get very tired when tea is over </s>
<s> 

but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no my love </s>
<s>  but you will soon be tired </s>
<s>  there will be a great many
people talking at once </s>
<s>  you will not like the noise </s>
<s> 

but my dear sir cried <abvr> weston if emma comes away early it will
be breaking up the party </s>
<s> 

and no great harm if it does said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  the sooner every
party breaks up the better </s>
<s> 

but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles </s>
<s>  emmas going
away directly after tea might be giving offence </s>
<s>  they are goodnatured
people and think little of their own claims </s>
<s>  but still they must
feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment </s>
<s>  and miss
woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in
the room </s>
<s>  you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am
sure sir </s>
<s>  friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have
been your neighbours these ten years </s>
<s>

<s>  cole is very bilious </s>
<s>  no i would not be the means
of giving them any pain </s>
<s>  my dear emma we must consider this </s>
<s>  i am sure
rather than run the risk of hurting <abvr> and <abvr> cole you would stay a

<s>  you must promise me not to sit
up </s>
<s> 

he did on the condition of some promises on her side </s>
<s>  such as that
if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly </s>

hungry that she would take something to eat </s>

sit up for her </s>

chapter viii


frank churchill came back again </s>
<s>  and if he kept his fathers dinner
waiting it was not known at hartfield </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston was too anxious
for his being a favourite with <abvr> woodhouse to betray any imperfection
which could be concealed </s>
<s> 

he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very
good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had
done </s>
<s>  he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion
of face </s>
<s>  no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits </s>
<s> 
he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever </s>
<s>  and after seeing him
emma thus moralised to herself </s>
<s> 

i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent
way </s>
<s>  wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly </s>
<s> it
depends upon the character of those who handle it </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley he is
not a trifling silly young man </s>
<s>  if he were he would have done this
differently </s>
<s>  he would either have gloried in the achievement or
been ashamed of it </s>
<s>  there would have been either the ostentation of
a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own
vanities </s>
<s> no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly </s>
<s> 

with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for
a longer time than hitherto </s>
<s>  of judging of his general manners and by
inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself </s>
<s>  of guessing
how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air </s>
<s> 
and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were
now seeing them together for the first time </s>
<s> 

she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at <abvr>
coles </s>
<s>  and without being able to forget that among the failings of <abvr>
elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than
his propensity to dine with <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

her fathers comfort was amply secured <abvr> bates as well as <abvr>
goddard being able to come </s>
<s>  and her last pleasing duty before she left
the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after
dinner </s>
<s>  and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her
dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping
them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever
unwilling selfdenial his care of their constitution might have obliged
them to practise during the meal </s>
<s> she had provided a plentiful dinner
for them </s>
<s>  she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat
it </s>
<s> 

she followed another carriage to <abvr> coles door </s>
<s>  and was pleased to see
that it was <abvr> knightleys </s>
<s>  for <abvr> knightley keeping no horses
having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and
independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get about as he could
and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey </s>
<s> 
she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from
her heart for he stopped to hand her out </s>
<s> 

this is coming as you should do said she </s>
<s>  like a gentleman </s>
<s> i am
quite glad to see you </s>
<s> 

he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same
moment </s>
<s>  for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual </s>
<s> you
might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner </s>
<s> 

yes i should i am sure i should </s>
<s>  there is always a look of
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be
beneath them </s>
<s>  you think you carry it off very well i dare say but
with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern </s>
<s>  i always
observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances </s>
<s>  now you have
nothing to try for </s>
<s>  you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed </s>
<s>  you
are not striving to look taller than any body else </s>
<s>  now i shall really
be very happy to walk into the same room with you </s>
<s> 

nonsensical girl </s>
<s>  was his reply but not at all in anger </s>
<s> 

emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as
with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  she was received with a cordial respect which could
not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for </s>
<s> 
when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of
admiration were for her from both husband and wife </s>
<s>  the son approached
her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object
and at dinner she found him seated by herand as she firmly believed
not without some dexterity on his side </s>
<s> 

the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper
unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of
naming among their acquaintance and the male part of <abvr> coxs family
the lawyer of highbury </s>
<s>  the less worthy females were to come in the
evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith </s>
<s>  but already
at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be
general </s>
<s>  and while politics and <abvr> elton were talked over emma could
fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour </s>
<s> 
the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was
the name of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole seemed to be relating something of
her that was expected to be very interesting </s>
<s>  she listened and found
it well worth listening to </s>
<s>  that very dear part of emma her fancy
received an amusing supply </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole was telling that she had been
calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had
been struck by the sight of a pianofortea very elegant looking
instrumentnot a grand but a largesized square pianoforte </s>
<s>  and the
substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of
surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations
on miss batess was that this pianoforte had arrived from
broadwoods the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and
nieceentirely unexpected </s>
<s>  that at first by miss batess account
jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could
possibly have ordered itbut now they were both perfectly satisfied
that it could be from only one quarter </s>
<s> of course it must be from
colonel campbell </s>
<s> 

one can suppose nothing else added <abvr> cole and i was only
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt </s>
<s>  but jane it seems
had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it </s>
<s> 
she knows their ways best </s>
<s>  but i should not consider their silence as
any reason for their not meaning to make the present </s>
<s>  they might chuse
to surprize her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  cole had many to agree with her </s>
<s>  every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made </s>
<s>  and there were
enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still
listen to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me
more satisfaction </s>
<s> it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who
plays so delightfully should not have an instrument </s>
<s>  it seemed quite
a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine
instruments are absolutely thrown away </s>
<s>  this is like giving ourselves
a slap to be sure </s>
<s>  and it was but yesterday i was telling <abvr> cole
i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the
drawingroom while i do not know one note from another and our little
girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of
it </s>
<s>  and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not
any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old
spinet in the world to amuse herself with </s>
<s> i was saying this to
mr </s>
<s>  cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me </s>
<s>  only he is so
particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself
in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so
obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can </s>
<s>  and that
really is the reason why the instrument was boughtor else i am sure
we ought to be ashamed of it </s>
<s> we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse
may be prevailed with to try it this evening </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence </s>
<s>  and finding that nothing
more was to be entrapped from any communication of <abvr> coles turned
to frank churchill </s>
<s> 

why do you smile </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

nay why do you </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being so rich
and so liberal </s>
<s> it is a handsome present </s>
<s> 

very </s>
<s> 

i rather wonder that it was never made before </s>
<s> 

perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before </s>
<s> 

or that he did not give her the use of their own instrumentwhich must
now be shut up in london untouched by any body </s>
<s> 

that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for <abvr>
batess house </s>
<s> 

you may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies that your
thoughts on this subject are very much like mine </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  i rather believe you are giving me more credit for
acuteness than i deserve </s>
<s>  i smile because you smile and shall probably
suspect whatever i find you suspect </s>
<s>  but at present i do not see what
there is to question </s>
<s>  if colonel campbell is not the person who can
be </s>
<s> 

what do you say to <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s>  very true indeed </s>
<s>  i had not thought of <abvr> dixon </s>
<s>  she must
know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be </s>
<s>  and
perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young
womans scheme than an elderly mans </s>
<s>  it is <abvr> dixon i dare say </s>
<s>  i
told you that your suspicions would guide mine </s>
<s> 

if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend <abvr> dixon in
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s> very well </s>
<s>  yes i immediately perceive that it must be the
joint present of <abvr> and <abvr> dixon </s>
<s>  we were speaking the other day you
know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance </s>
<s> 

yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had
entertained before </s>
<s> i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions
of either <abvr> dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either
that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune
to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little
attachment on her side </s>
<s>  one might guess twenty things without guessing
exactly the right </s>
<s>  but i am sure there must be a particular cause for
her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells
to ireland </s>
<s>  here she must be leading a life of privation and penance </s>
<s> 
there it would have been all enjoyment </s>
<s>  as to the pretence of trying her
native air i look upon that as a mere excuse </s>
<s> in the summer it might
have passed </s>
<s>  but what can any bodys native air do for them in the
months of january february and march </s>
<s>  good fires and carriages would
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare
say in hers </s>
<s>  i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though
you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what
they are </s>
<s> 

and upon my word they have an air of great probability </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixons
preference of her music to her friends i can answer for being very
decided </s>
<s> 

and then he saved her life </s>
<s>  did you ever hear of that </s>
<s> a water
party </s>
<s>  and by some accident she was falling overboard </s>
<s>  he caught her </s>
<s> 

he did </s>
<s>  i was thereone of the party </s>
<s> 

were you really </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> but you observed nothing of course for it
seems to be a new idea to you </s>
<s> if i had been there i think i should
have made some discoveries </s>
<s> 

i dare say you would </s>
<s>  but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that
miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that <abvr> dixon caught
her </s>
<s> it was the work of a moment </s>
<s>  and though the consequent shock and
alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i believe it was
half an hour before any of us were comfortable againyet that was too
general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be
observable </s>
<s>  i do not mean to say however that you might not have made
discoveries </s>
<s> 

the conversation was here interrupted </s>
<s>  they were called on to share
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and
obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others </s>
<s>  but when the table
was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly
right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said

the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me </s>
<s>  i wanted to know
a little more and this tells me quite enough </s>
<s>  depend upon it we shall
soon hear that it is a present from <abvr> and <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must
conclude it to come from the campbells </s>
<s> 

no i am sure it is not from the campbells </s>
<s>  miss fairfax knows it is
not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first </s>
<s>  she
would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them </s>
<s>  i may not have
convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that <abvr>
dixon is a principal in the business </s>
<s> 

indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced </s>
<s>  your reasonings
carry my judgment along with them entirely </s>
<s>  at first while i supposed
you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as
paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world </s>
<s> 
but when you mentioned <abvr> dixon i felt how much more probable that it
should be the tribute of warm female friendship </s>
<s>  and now i can see it in
no other light than as an offering of love </s>
<s> 

there was no occasion to press the matter farther </s>
<s>  the conviction seemed
real </s>
<s>  he looked as if he felt it </s>
<s>  she said no more other subjects
took their turn </s>
<s>  and the rest of the dinner passed away </s>
<s>  the dessert
succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the
usual rate of conversation </s>
<s>  a few clever things said a few downright
silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the
othernothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news
and heavy jokes </s>
<s> 

the ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other
ladies in their different divisions arrived </s>
<s>  emma watched the entree
of her own particular little friend </s>
<s>  and if she could not exult in her
dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and
the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light
cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many
alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed
affection </s>
<s>  there she satand who would have guessed how many tears she
had been lately shedding </s>
<s>  to be in company nicely dressed herself and
seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say
nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour </s>
<s>  jane fairfax
did look and move superior </s>
<s>  but emma suspected she might have been
glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the
mortification of having lovedyes of having loved even <abvr> elton in
vainby the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself
beloved by the husband of her friend </s>
<s> 

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her </s>
<s> 
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the
secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair
and therefore purposely kept at a distance </s>
<s>  but by the others the
subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of
consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush
of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel
campbell </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested
by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her
perseverance in dwelling on the subject </s>
<s>  and having so much to ask and
to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish
of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the
fair heroines countenance </s>
<s> 

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen </s>
<s>  and the very first
of the early was frank churchill </s>
<s>  in he walked the first and the
handsomest </s>
<s>  and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates
and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle
where sat miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  and till he could find a seat by her would
not sit at all </s>
<s>  emma divined what every body present must be thinking </s>
<s> 
she was his object and every body must perceive it </s>
<s>  she introduced him
to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard
what each thought of the other </s>
<s>  he had never seen so lovely a face and
was delighted with her naivete </s>
<s>  and she only to be sure it was paying
him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a
little like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  emma restrained her indignation and only turned
from her in silence </s>
<s> 

smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first
glancing towards miss fairfax </s>
<s>  but it was most prudent to avoid speech </s>
<s> 
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroomhated
sitting longwas always the first to move when he couldthat his
father <abvr> knightley <abvr> cox and <abvr> cole were left very busy over
parish businessthat as long as he had staid however it had been
pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike
sensible men </s>
<s>  and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogetherthought it
so abundant in agreeable familiesthat emma began to feel she had been
used to despise the place rather too much </s>
<s>  she questioned him as to the
society in yorkshirethe extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe
and the sort </s>
<s>  and could make out from his answers that as far as
enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their
visitings were among a range of great families none very near </s>
<s>  and
that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even
chance that <abvr> churchill were not in health and spirits for going </s>
<s> 
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person </s>
<s>  and that though
he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without
considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce
an acquaintance for a night </s>
<s> 

she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at
its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at
home than he liked </s>
<s>  his importance at enscombe was very evident </s>
<s>  he did
not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his
aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing
it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could
with time persuade her to any thing </s>
<s>  one of those points on which
his influence failed he then mentioned </s>
<s>  he had wanted very much to
go abroadhad been very eager indeed to be allowed to travelbut she
would not hear of it </s>
<s>  this had happened the year before </s>
<s>  now he said
he was beginning to have no longer the same wish </s>
<s> 

the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be
good behaviour to his father </s>
<s> 

i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause </s>
<s> 
i have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time </s>
<s>  i never knew days fly
so fast </s>
<s>  a week tomorrow </s>
<s> and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself </s>
<s> 
but just got acquainted with <abvr> weston and others </s>
<s> i hate the
recollection </s>
<s> 

perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out
of so few in having your hair cut </s>
<s> 

no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all </s>
<s>  i have
no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be
seen </s>
<s> 

the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to <abvr> cole </s>
<s>  when
mr </s>
<s>  cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before
she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss
fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

he started </s>
<s>  thank you for rousing me he replied </s>
<s>  i believe i have
been very rude </s>
<s>  but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a
wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes from her </s>
<s>  i never saw
any thing so outree </s>
<s> those curls </s>
<s> this must be a fancy of her own </s>
<s>  i
see nobody else looking like her </s>
<s> i must go and ask her whether it
is an irish fashion </s>
<s>  shall i </s>
<s> yes i willi declare i willand you
shall see how she takes it </s>
<s> whether she colours </s>
<s> 

he was gone immediately </s>
<s>  and emma soon saw him standing before miss
fairfax and talking to her </s>
<s>  but as to its effect on the young lady
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in
front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing </s>
<s> 

before he could return to his chair it was taken by <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

this is the luxury of a large party said she </s>
<s> one can get near
every body and say every thing </s>
<s>  my dear emma i am longing to talk
to you </s>
<s>  i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like
yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh </s>
<s>  do you know how
miss bates and her niece came here </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s> they were invited were not they </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesbut how they were conveyed hither </s>
<s> the manner of their
coming </s>
<s> 

they walked i conclude </s>
<s>  how else could they come </s>
<s> 

very true </s>
<s> well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and
cold as the nights are now </s>
<s>  and as i looked at her though i never saw
her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and
would therefore be particularly liable to take cold </s>
<s>  poor girl </s>
<s>  i could
not bear the idea of it </s>
<s>  so as soon as <abvr> weston came into the room
and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage </s>
<s>  you may guess
how readily he came into my wishes </s>
<s>  and having his approbation i made
my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be
at her service before it took us home </s>
<s>  for i thought it would be making
her comfortable at once </s>
<s>  good soul </s>
<s>  she was as grateful as possible you
may be sure </s>
<s>  ˜nobody was ever so fortunate as herself </s>
<s> but with many
many thanks˜there was no occasion to trouble us for <abvr> knightleys
carriage had brought and was to take them home again </s>
<s>  i was quite
surprized </s>
<s> very glad i am sure </s>
<s>  but really quite surprized </s>
<s>  such a
very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention </s>
<s> the sort of thing
that so few men would think of </s>
<s>  and in short from knowing his
usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their
accommodation the carriage was used at all </s>
<s>  i do suspect he would not
have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse
for assisting them </s>
<s> 

very likely said emmanothing more likely </s>
<s>  i know no man more
likely than <abvr> knightley to do the sort of thingto do any thing
really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent </s>
<s>  he is not a
gallant man but he is a very humane one </s>
<s>  and this considering jane
fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case of humanity to him </s>
<s> and for
an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on
more than on <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i know he had horses todayfor we arrived
together </s>
<s>  and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that
could betray </s>
<s> 

well said <abvr> weston smiling you give him credit for more simple
disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do </s>
<s>  for while miss
bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never
been able to get it out again </s>
<s>  the more i think of it the more probable
it appears </s>
<s>  in short i have made a match between <abvr> knightley and jane
fairfax </s>
<s>  see the consequence of keeping you company </s>
<s> what do you say to
it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley and jane fairfax </s>
<s>  exclaimed emma </s>
<s>  dear <abvr> weston how
could you think of such a thing </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley must not
marry </s>
<s> you would not have little henry cut out from donwell </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no
no henry must have donwell </s>
<s>  i cannot at all consent to <abvr> knightleys
marrying </s>
<s>  and i am sure it is not at all likely </s>
<s>  i am amazed that you
should think of such a thing </s>
<s> 

my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it </s>
<s>  i do not want
the matchi do not want to injure dear little henrybut the idea has
been given me by circumstances </s>
<s>  and if <abvr> knightley really wished to
marry you would not have him refrain on henrys account a boy of six
years old who knows nothing of the matter </s>
<s> 

yes i would </s>
<s>  i could not bear to have henry supplanted </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s> 
knightley marry </s>
<s> no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt
it now </s>
<s>  and jane fairfax too of all women </s>
<s> 

nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well
know </s>
<s> 

but the imprudence of such a match </s>
<s> 

i am not speaking of its prudence </s>
<s>  merely its probability </s>
<s> 

i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than
what you mention </s>
<s>  his goodnature his humanity as i tell you would
be quite enough to account for the horses </s>
<s>  he has a great regard for the
bateses you know independent of jane fairfaxand is always glad to
shew them attention </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> weston do not take to matchmaking </s>
<s> 
you do it very ill </s>
<s>  jane fairfax mistress of the abbey </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no
no </s>
<s> every feeling revolts </s>
<s>  for his own sake i would not have him do so
mad a thing </s>
<s> 

imprudent if you pleasebut not mad </s>
<s>  excepting inequality of fortune
and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> knightley does not want to marry </s>
<s>  i am sure he has not the
least idea of it </s>
<s>  do not put it into his head </s>
<s>  why should he marry </s>
<s> he
is as happy as possible by himself </s>
<s>  with his farm and his sheep and
his library and all the parish to manage </s>
<s>  and he is extremely fond of
his brothers children </s>
<s>  he has no occasion to marry either to fill up
his time or his heart </s>
<s> 

my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so </s>
<s>  but if he really loves
jane fairfax

nonsense </s>
<s>  he does not care about jane fairfax </s>
<s>  in the way of love i am
sure he does not </s>
<s>  he would do any good to her or her family </s>
<s>  but

well said <abvr> weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could
do them would be to give jane such a respectable home </s>
<s> 

if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself </s>
<s>  a
very shameful and degrading connexion </s>
<s>  how would he bear to have miss
bates belonging to him </s>
<s> to have her haunting the abbey and thanking
him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane </s>
<s> ˜so very
kind and obliging </s>
<s> but he always had been such a very kind neighbour </s>
<s> 
and then fly off through half a sentence to her mothers old
petticoat </s>
<s>  ˜not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still
it would last a great whileand indeed she must thankfully say that
their petticoats were all very strong </s>
<s> 

for shame emma </s>
<s>  do not mimic her </s>
<s>  you divert me against my conscience </s>
<s> 
and upon my word i do not think <abvr> knightley would be much disturbed
by miss bates </s>
<s>  little things do not irritate him </s>
<s>  she might talk on </s>
<s>  and
if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and
drown her voice </s>
<s>  but the question is not whether it would be a bad
connexion for him but whether he wishes it </s>
<s>  and i think he does </s>
<s>  i have
heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  the
interest he takes in herhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that
she should have no happier prospect </s>
<s>  i have heard him express himself
so warmly on those points </s>
<s> such an admirer of her performance on the
pianoforte and of her voice </s>
<s>  i have heard him say that he could listen
to her for ever </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred
to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebodythough
we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the
campbells may it not be from <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i cannot help suspecting
him </s>
<s>  i think he is just the person to do it even without being in
love </s>
<s> 

then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love </s>
<s>  but i do not
think it is at all a likely thing for him to do </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley does
nothing mysteriously </s>
<s> 

i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly </s>
<s>  oftener
than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of
things occur to him </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  and if he had intended to give her one he would have told
her so </s>
<s> 

there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma </s>
<s>  i have a very strong
notion that it comes from him </s>
<s>  i am sure he was particularly silent when
mrs </s>
<s>  cole told us of it at dinner </s>
<s> 

you take up an idea <abvr> weston and run away with it </s>
<s>  as you have
many a time reproached me with doing </s>
<s>  i see no sign of attachmenti
believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince me that
mr </s>
<s>  knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

they combated the point some time longer in the same way </s>
<s>  emma rather
gaining ground over the mind of her friend </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston was the most
used of the two to yield </s>
<s>  till a little bustle in the room shewed them
that tea was over and the instrument in preparation </s>
<s> and at the same
moment <abvr> cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the
honour of trying it </s>
<s>  frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her
conversation with <abvr> weston she had been seeing nothing except that
he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed <abvr> cole to add his very
pressing entreaties </s>
<s>  and as in every respect it suited emma best to
lead she gave a very proper compliance </s>
<s> 

she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than
she could perform with credit </s>
<s>  she wanted neither taste nor spirit in
the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany
her own voice well </s>
<s>  one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by
surprizea second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill </s>
<s>  her
pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual
followed </s>
<s>  he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect
knowledge of music </s>
<s>  which was properly denied </s>
<s>  and that he knew nothing
of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted </s>
<s>  they sang
together once more </s>
<s>  and emma would then resign her place to miss
fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could
attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own </s>
<s> 

with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the
numbers round the instrument to listen </s>
<s>  frank churchill sang again </s>
<s> 
they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth </s>
<s>  but the
sight of <abvr> knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half
emmas mind </s>
<s>  and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of
mrs </s>
<s>  westons suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices
gave only momentary interruptions </s>
<s>  her objections to <abvr> knightleys
marrying did not in the least subside </s>
<s>  she could see nothing but evil
in it </s>
<s>  it would be a great disappointment to <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> 
consequently to isabella </s>
<s>  a real injury to the childrena most
mortifying change and material loss to them all </s>
<s> a very great
deduction from her fathers daily comfortand as to herself she could
not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey </s>
<s>  a <abvr>
knightley for them all to give way to </s>
<s> nomr </s>
<s>  knightley must never
marry </s>
<s>  little henry must remain the heir of donwell </s>
<s> 

presently <abvr> knightley looked back and came and sat down by her </s>
<s>  they
talked at first only of the performance </s>
<s>  his admiration was certainly
very warm </s>
<s>  yet she thought but for <abvr> weston it would not have
struck her </s>
<s>  as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his
kindness in conveying the aunt and niece </s>
<s>  and though his answer was in
the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only
his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own </s>
<s> 

i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage
more useful on such occasions </s>
<s>  it is not that i am without the wish </s>
<s>  but
you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should putto
for such a purpose </s>
<s> 

quite out of the question quite out of the question he
replied </s>
<s> but you must often wish it i am sure </s>
<s>  and he smiled with
such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another
step </s>
<s> 

this present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte is very
kindly given </s>
<s> 

yes he replied and without the smallest apparent
embarrassment </s>
<s> but they would have done better had they given
her notice of it </s>
<s>  surprizes are foolish things </s>
<s>  the pleasure is not
enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable </s>
<s>  i should have
expected better judgment in colonel campbell </s>
<s> 

from that moment emma could have taken her oath that <abvr> knightley had
had no concern in giving the instrument </s>
<s>  but whether he were
entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual
preferenceremained a little longer doubtful </s>
<s>  towards the end of janes
second song her voice grew thick </s>
<s> 

that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloudyou have
sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet </s>
<s> 

another song however was soon begged for </s>
<s>  one more </s>
<s> they would not
fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more </s>
<s> 
 and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this
without effort </s>
<s>  the first part is so very trifling </s>
<s>  the strength of the
song falls on the second </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley grew angry </s>
<s> 

that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off
his own voice </s>
<s>  this must not be </s>
<s>  and touching miss bates who at that
moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let your niece sing
herself hoarse in this manner </s>
<s>  go and interfere </s>
<s>  they have no mercy on
her </s>
<s> 

miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to
be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther
singing </s>
<s>  here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse
and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers </s>
<s>  but soon within
five minutes the proposal of dancingoriginating nobody exactly knew
wherewas so effectually promoted by <abvr> and <abvr> cole that every
thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
capital in her countrydances was seated and beginning an irresistible
waltz </s>
<s>  and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to
emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top </s>
<s> 

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off
emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on
her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s>  this would be a trial </s>
<s>  he was no dancer in general </s>
<s>  if he
were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur
something </s>
<s>  there was no immediate appearance </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  he was talking to <abvr>
colehe was looking on unconcerned </s>
<s>  jane was asked by somebody else
and he was still talking to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

emma had no longer an alarm for henry </s>
<s>  his interest was yet safe </s>
<s>  and
she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment </s>
<s>  not more than
five couple could be mustered </s>
<s>  but the rarity and the suddenness of
it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a
partner </s>
<s>  they were a couple worth looking at </s>
<s> 

two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed </s>
<s>  it was
growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mothers
account </s>
<s>  after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again
they were obliged to thank <abvr> weston look sorrowful and have done </s>
<s> 

perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to
her carriage </s>
<s>  i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing
would not have agreed with me after yours </s>

chapter ix


emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles </s>
<s>  the visit
afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day </s>
<s>  and all that she
might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must
be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity </s>
<s>  she must have delighted
the colesworthy people who deserved to be made happy </s>
<s> and left a
name behind her that would not soon die away </s>
<s> 

perfect happiness even in memory is not common </s>
<s>  and there were two
points on which she was not quite easy </s>
<s>  she doubted whether she had not
transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of
jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill </s>
<s>  it was hardly right </s>
<s>  but it
had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission
to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made
it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her
tongue </s>
<s> 

the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and
there she had no doubt </s>
<s>  she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the
inferiority of her own playing and singing </s>
<s>  she did most heartily
grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised
vigorously an hour and a half </s>
<s> 

she was then interrupted by harriets coming in </s>
<s>  and if harriets praise
could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax </s>
<s> 

dont class us together harriet </s>
<s>  my playing is no more like hers
than a lamp is like sunshine </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  deari think you play the best of the two </s>
<s>  i think you play quite
as well as she does </s>
<s>  i am sure i had much rather hear you </s>
<s>  every body
last night said how well you played </s>
<s> 

those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference </s>
<s>  the
truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised
but jane fairfaxs is much beyond it </s>
<s> 

well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or
that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole
said how much taste you had </s>
<s>  and <abvr> frank churchill talked a great deal
about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  but jane fairfax has them both harriet </s>
<s> 

are you sure </s>
<s>  i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any
taste </s>
<s>  nobody talked about it </s>
<s>  and i hate italian singing </s>
<s> there is no
understanding a word of it </s>
<s>  besides if she does play so very well you
know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to
teach </s>
<s>  the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into
any great family </s>
<s>  how did you think the coxes looked </s>
<s> 

just as they always dovery vulgar </s>
<s> 

they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly </s>
<s>  but it is
nothing of any consequence </s>
<s> 

emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its
producing <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

they told methat <abvr> martin dined with them last saturday </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s> 

he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to
dinner </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s> 

they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox </s>
<s>  i do not know
what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there
again next summer </s>
<s> 

she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should
be </s>
<s> 

she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there </s>
<s>  he sat by her at
dinner </s>
<s>  miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry
him </s>
<s> 

very likely </s>
<s> i think they are without exception the most vulgar
girls in highbury </s>
<s> 

harriet had business at fords </s>
<s> emma thought it most prudent to go with
her </s>
<s>  another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in
her present state would be dangerous </s>
<s> 

harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always
very long at a purchase </s>
<s>  and while she was still hanging over muslins
and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement </s>
<s> much could
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury </s>
<s> <abvr>
perry walking hastily by <abvr> william cox letting himself in at the
officedoor <abvr> coles carriagehorses returning from exercise or a
stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she
could presume to expect </s>
<s>  and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with
his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full
basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling
children round the bakers little bowwindow eyeing the gingerbread she
knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough </s>
<s>  quite enough
still to stand at the door </s>
<s>  a mind lively and at ease can do with
seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer </s>
<s> 

she looked down the randalls road </s>
<s>  the scene enlarged </s>
<s>  two persons
appeared </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston and her soninlaw </s>
<s>  they were walking into
highbury </s>
<s> to hartfield of course </s>
<s>  they were stopping however in the
first place at <abvr> batess </s>
<s>  whose house was a little nearer
randalls than fords </s>
<s>  and had all but knocked when emma caught their
eye </s>
<s> immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her </s>
<s>  and the
agreeableness of yesterdays engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to
the present meeting </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston informed her that she was going to call
on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument </s>
<s> 

for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss
bates last night that i would come this morning </s>
<s>  i was not aware of it
myself </s>
<s>  i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i
am going now </s>
<s> 

and while <abvr> weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said
frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfieldif
you are going home </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was disappointed </s>
<s> 

i thought you meant to go with me </s>
<s>  they would be very much pleased </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  i should be quite in the way </s>
<s>  but perhapsi may be equally in the
way here </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me </s>
<s>  my aunt always
sends me off when she is shopping </s>
<s>  she says i fidget her to death </s>
<s>  and
miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same </s>
<s>  what am i to
do </s>
<s> 

i am here on no business of my own said emma </s>
<s>  i am only waiting for
my friend </s>
<s>  she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home </s>
<s> 
but you had better go with <abvr> weston and hear the instrument </s>
<s> 

wellif you advise it </s>
<s> but with a smile if colonel campbell should
have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an
indifferent tonewhat shall i say </s>
<s>  i shall be no support to <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  she might do very well by herself </s>
<s>  a disagreeable truth would be
palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world
at a civil falsehood </s>
<s> 

i do not believe any such thing replied emma </s>
<s> i am persuaded that
you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary </s>
<s>  but
there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent </s>
<s>  quite
otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion last night </s>
<s> 

do come with me said <abvr> weston if it be not very disagreeable to
you </s>
<s>  it need not detain us long </s>
<s>  we will go to hartfield afterwards </s>
<s> 
we will follow them to hartfield </s>
<s>  i really wish you to call with me </s>
<s>  it
will be felt so great an attention </s>
<s>  and i always thought you meant it </s>
<s> 

he could say no more </s>
<s>  and with the hope of hartfield to reward him
returned with <abvr> weston to <abvr> batess door </s>
<s>  emma watched them in
and then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all
the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain
muslin it was of no use to look at figured </s>
<s>  and that a blue ribbon be
it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern </s>
<s>  at
last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel </s>
<s> 

should i send it to <abvr> goddards maam </s>
<s>  asked <abvr>
ford </s>
<s> yesnoyes to <abvr> goddards </s>
<s>  only my pattern gown is at
hartfield </s>
<s>  no you shall send it to hartfield if you please </s>
<s>  but then
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard will want to see it </s>
<s> and i could take the pattern gown
home any day </s>
<s>  but i shall want the ribbon directlyso it had better go
to hartfieldat least the ribbon </s>
<s>  you could make it into two parcels
mrs </s>
<s>  ford could not you </s>
<s> 

it is not worth while harriet to give <abvr> ford the trouble of two
parcels </s>
<s> 

no more it is </s>
<s> 

no trouble in the world maam said the obliging <abvr> ford </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but indeed i would much rather have it only in one </s>
<s>  then if you
please you shall send it all to <abvr> goddardsi do not knowno i
think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and
take it home with me at night </s>
<s>  what do you advise </s>
<s> 

that you do not give another halfsecond to the subject </s>
<s>  to hartfield
if you please <abvr> ford </s>
<s> 

aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should
not at all like to have it sent to <abvr> goddards </s>
<s> 

voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston and miss bates met them at the door </s>
<s> 

my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while
and give us your opinion of our new instrument </s>
<s>  you and miss smith </s>
<s>  how
do you do miss smith </s>
<s> very well i thank you </s>
<s> and i begged <abvr> weston
to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding </s>
<s> 

i hope <abvr> bates and miss fairfax are

very well i am much obliged to you </s>
<s>  my mother is delightfully well </s>
<s> 
and jane caught no cold last night </s>
<s>  how is <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s> i am so glad
to hear such a good account </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston told me you were here </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> 
then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me
just to run across and entreat her to come in </s>
<s>  my mother will be so
very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party she cannot
refuse </s>
<s> ˜aye pray do said <abvr> frank churchill ˜miss woodhouses
opinion of the instrument will be worth having </s>
<s> but said i i shall
be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me </s>
<s> ˜oh said
he ˜wait half a minute till i have finished my job </s>
<s> for would you
believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in
the world fastening in the rivet of my mothers spectacles </s>
<s> the rivet
came out you know this morning </s>
<s> so very obliging </s>
<s> for my mother had
no use of her spectaclescould not put them on </s>
<s>  and by the bye every
body ought to have two pair of spectacles </s>
<s>  they should indeed </s>
<s>  jane said
so </s>
<s>  i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did
but something or other hindered me all the morning </s>
<s>  first one thing
then another there is no saying what you know </s>
<s>  at one time patty came
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping </s>
<s>  oh said i
patty do not come with your bad news to me </s>
<s>  here is the rivet of your
mistresss spectacles out </s>
<s>  then the baked apples came home <abvr> wallis
sent them by her boy </s>
<s>  they are extremely civil and obliging to us the
wallises alwaysi have heard some people say that <abvr> wallis can be
uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing
but the greatest attention from them </s>
<s>  and it cannot be for the value
of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know </s>
<s> 
only three of us </s>
<s> besides dear jane at presentand she really eats
nothingmakes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened
if you saw it </s>
<s>  i dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i
say one thing and then i say another and it passes off </s>
<s>  but about the
middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so
well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took
the opportunity the other day of asking <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  i happened to meet
him in the street </s>
<s>  not that i had any doubt beforei have so often
heard <abvr> woodhouse recommend a baked apple </s>
<s>  i believe it is the only
way that <abvr> woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome </s>
<s>  we
have appledumplings however very often </s>
<s>  patty makes an excellent
appledumpling </s>
<s>  well <abvr> weston you have prevailed i hope and these
ladies will oblige us </s>
<s> 

emma would be very happy to wait on <abvr> bates &c </s>
<s>  and they did at
last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than

how do you do <abvr> ford </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon </s>
<s>  i did not see you before </s>
<s> 
i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town </s>
<s>  jane
came back delighted yesterday </s>
<s>  thank ye the gloves do very wellonly a
little too large about the wrist </s>
<s>  but jane is taking them in </s>
<s> 

what was i talking of </s>
<s>  said she beginning again when they were all in
the street </s>
<s> 

emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix </s>
<s> 

i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  my mothers
spectacles </s>
<s>  so very obliging of <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  ˜oh </s>

˜i do think i can fasten the rivet </s>

excessively </s>
<s> which you know shewed him to be so very </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  indeed i must
say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected
he very far exceeds any thing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

excessively </s>
<s>  i never shall forget his manner </s>

the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very
obliging as to take some ˜oh </s>

homebaked apples i ever saw in my life </s>

very </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment </s>
<s>  indeed they
are very delightful apples and <abvr> wallis does them full justiceonly
we do not have them baked more than twice and <abvr> woodhouse made us
promise to have them done three timesbut miss woodhouse will be so
good as not to mention it </s>
<s>  the apples themselves are the very finest
sort for baking beyond a doubt </s>
<s>  all from donwellsome of <abvr>
knightleys most liberal supply </s>
<s>  he sends us a sack every year </s>
<s>  and
certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his
treesi believe there is two of them </s>
<s>  my mother says the orchard was
always famous in her younger days </s>
<s>  but i was really quite shocked the
other dayfor <abvr> knightley called one morning and jane was eating
these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed
them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock </s>
<s>  ˜i
am sure you must be said he ˜and i will send you another supply </s>
<s>  for
i have a great many more than i can ever use </s>
<s>  william larkins let me
keep a larger quantity than usual this year </s>
<s>  i will send you some more
before they get good for nothing </s>
<s>  so i begged he would notfor really
as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great
many leftit was but half a dozen indeed </s>
<s>  but they should be all kept
for jane </s>
<s>  and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more
so liberal as he had been already </s>
<s>  and jane said the same </s>
<s>  and when
he was gone she almost quarrelled with meno i should not say
quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives </s>
<s>  but she was quite
distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone </s>
<s>  she wished
i had made him believe we had a great many left </s>
<s>  oh said i my dear
i did say as much as i could </s>
<s>  however the very same evening william
larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of
apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down
and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose </s>
<s> 
william larkins is such an old acquaintance </s>
<s>  i am always glad to see
him </s>
<s>  but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it
was all the apples of that sort his master had </s>
<s>  he had brought them
alland now his master had not one left to bake or boil </s>
<s>  william did
not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had
sold so many </s>
<s>  for william you know thinks more of his masters profit
than any thing </s>
<s>  but <abvr> hodges he said was quite displeased at their
being all sent away </s>
<s>  she could not bear that her master should not be
able to have another appletart this spring </s>
<s>  he told patty this but bid
her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for
mrs </s>
<s>  hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks
were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder </s>
<s>  and so patty told
me and i was excessively shocked indeed </s>

know any thing about it for the world </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  i wanted
to keep it from janes knowledge </s>

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door </s>

walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to

chapter x


the appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered was
tranquillity itself </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates deprived of her usual employment
slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near
her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax
standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte </s>
<s> 

busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy
countenance on seeing emma again </s>
<s> 

this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least
ten minutes earlier than i had calculated </s>
<s>  you find me trying to be
useful </s>
<s>  tell me if you think i shall succeed </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston have not you finished it yet </s>
<s>  you would not
earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate </s>
<s> 

i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been
assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily
it was not quite firm </s>
<s>  an unevenness in the floor i believe </s>
<s>  you see
we have been wedging one leg with paper </s>
<s>  this was very kind of you to be
persuaded to come </s>
<s>  i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home </s>
<s> 

he contrived that she should be seated by him </s>
<s>  and was sufficiently
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make
her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready
to sit down to the pianoforte again </s>
<s>  that she was not immediately ready
emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves </s>
<s>  she had not yet
possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion </s>
<s>  she
must reason herself into the power of performance </s>
<s>  and emma could not
but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve
never to expose them to her neighbour again </s>
<s> 

at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the
powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston had been delighted before and was delighted again </s>
<s>  emma
joined her in all her praise </s>
<s>  and the pianoforte with every proper
discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise </s>
<s> 

whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a
smile at emma the person has not chosen ill </s>
<s>  i heard a good deal of
colonel campbells taste at weymouth </s>
<s>  and the softness of the upper
notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would
particularly prize </s>
<s>  i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his
friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself </s>
<s>  do not you
think so </s>
<s> 

jane did not look round </s>
<s>  she was not obliged to hear </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had
been speaking to her at the same moment </s>
<s> 

it is not fair said emma in a whisper </s>
<s>  mine was a random guess </s>
<s>  do
not distress her </s>
<s> 

he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little
doubt and very little mercy </s>
<s>  soon afterwards he began again

how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this
occasion miss fairfax </s>
<s>  i dare say they often think of you and wonder
which will be the day the precise day of the instruments coming to
hand </s>
<s>  do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going
forward just at this time </s>
<s> do you imagine it to be the consequence
of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only
a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon
contingencies and conveniences </s>
<s> 

he paused </s>
<s>  she could not but hear </s>
<s>  she could not avoid answering

till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of
forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence </s>
<s>  it must be
all conjecture </s>
<s> 

conjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one
conjectures wrong </s>
<s>  i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this
rivet quite firm </s>
<s>  what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard
at work if one talks at all </s>
<s> your real workmen i suppose hold their
tongues </s>
<s>  but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordmiss
fairfax said something about conjecturing </s>
<s>  there it is done </s>
<s>  i have the
pleasure madam to <abvr> bates of restoring your spectacles healed
for the present </s>
<s> 

he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter </s>
<s>  to escape a
little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss
fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more </s>
<s> 

if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we
danced last night </s>
<s> let me live them over again </s>
<s>  you did not enjoy them
as i did </s>
<s>  you appeared tired the whole time </s>
<s>  i believe you were glad we
danced no longer </s>
<s>  but i would have given worldsall the worlds one ever
has to givefor another halfhour </s>
<s> 

she played </s>
<s> 

what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one
happy </s>
<s> if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth </s>
<s> 

she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something
else </s>
<s>  he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning
to emma said

here is something quite new to me </s>
<s>  do you know it </s>
<s> cramer </s>
<s> and here
are a new set of irish melodies </s>
<s>  that from such a quarter one might
expect </s>
<s>  this was all sent with the instrument </s>
<s>  very thoughtful of
colonel campbell was not it </s>
<s> he knew miss fairfax could have no music
here </s>
<s>  i honour that part of the attention particularly </s>
<s>  it shews it to
have been so thoroughly from the heart </s>
<s>  nothing hastily done </s>
<s>  nothing
incomplete </s>
<s>  true affection only could have prompted it </s>
<s> 

emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused </s>
<s> 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains
of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness
there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the
amusement and much less compunction with respect to her </s>
<s> this
amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very
reprehensible feelings </s>
<s> 

he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together </s>
<s> emma
took the opportunity of whispering

you speak too plain </s>
<s>  she must understand you </s>
<s> 

i hope she does </s>
<s>  i would have her understand me </s>
<s>  i am not in the least
ashamed of my meaning </s>
<s> 

but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea </s>
<s> 

i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me </s>
<s>  i have now
a key to all her odd looks and ways </s>
<s>  leave shame to her </s>
<s>  if she does
wrong she ought to feel it </s>
<s> 

she is not entirely without it i think </s>
<s> 

i do not see much sign of it </s>
<s>  she is playing robin adair at this
momenthis favourite </s>
<s> 

shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried <abvr>
knightley on horseback not far off </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley i declare </s>
<s> i must speak to him if possible just to
thank him </s>
<s>  i will not open the window here </s>
<s>  it would give you all cold </s>
<s> 
but i can go into my mothers room you know </s>
<s>  i dare say he will come
in when he knows who is here </s>
<s>  quite delightful to have you all meet
so </s>
<s> our little room so honoured </s>
<s> 

she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the
casement there immediately called <abvr> knightleys attention and every
syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as
if it had passed within the same apartment </s>
<s> 

how d ye do </s>
<s> how dye do </s>
<s> very well i thank you </s>
<s>  so obliged to you
for the carriage last night </s>
<s>  we were just in time </s>
<s>  my mother just ready

<s>  do come in </s>
<s>  you will find some friends here </s>
<s> 

so began miss bates </s>
<s>  and <abvr> knightley seemed determined to be heard in
his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say

how is your niece miss bates </s>
<s> i want to inquire after you all but
particularly your niece </s>
<s>  how is miss fairfax </s>
<s> i hope she caught no cold
last night </s>
<s>  how is she today </s>
<s>  tell me how miss fairfax is </s>
<s> 

and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear
her in any thing else </s>
<s>  the listeners were amused </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston gave
emma a look of particular meaning </s>
<s>  but emma still shook her head in
steady scepticism </s>
<s> 

so obliged to you </s>
<s> so very much obliged to you for the carriage
 resumed miss bates </s>
<s> 

he cut her short with

i am going to kingston </s>
<s>  can i do any thing for you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>

<s> <abvr> cole was saying the other day she
wanted something from kingston </s>

oh </s>
<s>  very delightful indeed </s>
<s>  i can say nothing less for i suppose miss
woodhouse and <abvr> frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes </s>
<s> 
and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should
not be mentioned too </s>
<s>  i think miss fairfax dances very well </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
weston is the very best countrydance player without exception
in england </s>
<s>  now if your friends have any gratitude they will say
something pretty loud about you and me in return </s>
<s>  but i cannot stay to
hear it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley one moment more </s>
<s>  something of consequenceso
shocked </s>

what is the matter now </s>
<s> 

to think of your sending us all your store apples </s>
<s>  you said you had
a great many and now you have not one left </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  well returning to the
room i have not been able to succeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley cannot stop </s>

going to kingston </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was
open and the window was open and <abvr> knightley spoke loud </s>
<s>  you must
have heard every thing to be sure </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse must you

<s> you seem but just comeso very obliging of you </s>
<s> 

emma found it really time to be at home </s>
<s>  the visit had already lasted
long </s>
<s>  and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived
to be gone that <abvr> weston and her companion taking leave also could
allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield
gates before they set off for randalls </s>

chapter xi


it may be possible to do without dancing entirely </s>
<s>  instances have been
known of young people passing many many months successively without
being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue
either to body or mind </s>
<s> but when a beginning is madewhen the
felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly feltit
must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more </s>
<s> 

frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again </s>
<s> 
and the last halfhour of an evening which <abvr> woodhouse was persuaded
to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young
people in schemes on the subject </s>
<s>  franks was the first idea </s>
<s>  and his
the greatest zeal in pursuing it </s>
<s>  for the lady was the best judge of the
difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance </s>
<s> 
but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how
delightfully <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedfor
doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane
fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked
aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in
to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions
of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that
mr </s>
<s>  weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little
the largest </s>
<s> 

his first proposition and request that the dance begun at <abvr> coles
should be finished therethat the same party should be collected
and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and <abvr> weston
most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance </s>
<s> 
and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who
there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space
to every couple </s>
<s> 

you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss
coxes five had been repeated many times over </s>
<s>  and there will be the
two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure </s>
<s>  you and miss smith and
miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five </s>
<s>  and for five
couple there will be plenty of room </s>
<s> 

but soon it came to be on one side

but will there be good room for five couple </s>
<s> i really do not think
there will </s>
<s> 

on another

and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to
stand up </s>
<s>  five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it </s>
<s> 
it will not do to invite five couple </s>
<s>  it can be allowable only as the
thought of the moment </s>
<s> 

somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and
must be invited with the rest </s>
<s>  somebody else believed <abvr> gilbert
would have danced the other evening if she had been asked </s>
<s>  a word was
put in for a second young cox </s>
<s>  and at last <abvr> weston naming one family
of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance
who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple
would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what
possible manner they could be disposed of </s>
<s> 

the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other </s>
<s>  might not
they use both rooms and dance across the passage </s>
<s>  it seemed the
best scheme </s>
<s>  and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a
better </s>
<s>  emma said it would be awkward </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was in distress about
the supper </s>
<s>  and <abvr> woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of
health </s>
<s>  it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be
persevered in </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no said he </s>
<s>  it would be the extreme of imprudence </s>
<s>  i could not
bear it for emma </s>
<s> emma is not strong </s>
<s>  she would catch a dreadful cold </s>
<s> 
so would poor little harriet </s>
<s>  so you would all </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston you would
be quite laid up </s>
<s>  do not let them talk of such a wild thing </s>
<s>  pray do
not let them talk of it </s>
<s>  that young man speaking lower is very
thoughtless </s>
<s>  do not tell his father but that young man is not quite
the thing </s>
<s>  he has been opening the doors very often this evening
and keeping them open very inconsiderately </s>
<s>  he does not think of the
draught </s>
<s>  i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not
quite the thing </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was sorry for such a charge </s>
<s>  she knew the importance of
it and said every thing in her power to do it away </s>
<s>  every door was now
closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only
in the room they were in resorted to again </s>
<s>  and with such goodwill on
frank churchills part that the space which a quarter of an hour before
had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured
to be made out quite enough for ten </s>
<s> 

we were too magnificent said he </s>
<s>  we allowed unnecessary room </s>
<s>  ten
couple may stand here very well </s>
<s> 

emma demurred </s>
<s>  it would be a crowda sad crowd </s>
<s>  and what could be
worse than dancing without space to turn in </s>
<s> 

very true he gravely replied </s>
<s>  it was very bad </s>
<s>  but still he went on
measuring and still he ended with

i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple </s>
<s> 

no no said she you are quite unreasonable </s>
<s>  it would be dreadful
to be standing so close </s>
<s>  nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be
dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room </s>
<s> 

there is no denying it he replied </s>
<s>  i agree with you exactly </s>
<s>  a crowd
in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures
in a few words </s>
<s>  exquisite quite exquisite </s>
<s> still however having
proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up </s>
<s>  it would be
a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am
rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well </s>
<s> 

emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little
selfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of
dancing with her </s>
<s>  but she took the compliment and forgave the rest </s>
<s> 
had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to
pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference
and the character of his temper </s>
<s>  but for all the purposes of their
acquaintance he was quite amiable enough </s>
<s> 

before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield </s>
<s>  and he entered
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of
the scheme </s>
<s>  it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination
for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors
of my fathers little rooms </s>
<s>  i bring a new proposal on the subject </s>
<s> a
thought of my fathers which waits only your approbation to be acted
upon </s>
<s>  may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances
of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the
crown inn </s>
<s> 

the crown </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  if you and <abvr> woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there </s>
<s> 
better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful
welcome than at randalls </s>
<s>  it is his own idea </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston sees no
objection to it provided you are satisfied </s>
<s>  this is what we all feel </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  you were perfectly right </s>
<s>  ten couple in either of the randalls
rooms would have been insufferable </s>
<s> dreadful </s>
<s> i felt how right you
were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing
to like to yield </s>
<s>  is not it a good exchange </s>
<s> you consenti hope you
consent </s>
<s> 

it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if <abvr> and <abvr>
weston do not </s>
<s>  i think it admirable </s>
<s>  and as far as i can answer for
myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement that could
be </s>
<s>  papa do you not think it an excellent improvement </s>
<s> 

she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully
comprehended </s>
<s>  and then being quite new farther representations were
necessary to make it acceptable </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad planmuch
worse than the other </s>
<s>  a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous </s>
<s> 
never properly aired or fit to be inhabited </s>
<s>  if they must dance they
had better dance at randalls </s>
<s>  he had never been in the room at the crown
in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sight </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noa
very bad plan </s>
<s>  they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere </s>
<s> 

i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the
great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger
of any bodys catching coldso much less danger at the crown than at
randalls </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry might have reason to regret the alteration but
nobody else could </s>
<s> 

sir said <abvr> woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken
if you suppose <abvr> perry to be that sort of character </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry is
extremely concerned when any of us are ill </s>
<s>  but i do not understand how
the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fathers house </s>
<s> 

from the very circumstance of its being larger sir </s>
<s>  we shall have no
occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening </s>
<s>  and it
is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon
heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief </s>
<s> 

open the windows </s>
<s> but surely <abvr> churchill nobody would think of
opening the windows at randalls </s>
<s>  nobody could be so imprudent </s>
<s>  i never
heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  dancing with open windows </s>
<s> i am sure neither
your father nor <abvr> weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer
it </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a
windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected </s>
<s>  i have
often known it done myself </s>
<s> 

have you indeed sir </s>
<s> bless me </s>
<s>  i never could have supposed it </s>
<s>  but i
live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear </s>
<s>  however
this does make a difference </s>
<s>  and perhaps when we come to talk it
overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration </s>
<s>  one
cannot resolve upon them in a hurry </s>
<s>  if <abvr> and <abvr> weston will be so
obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what
can be done </s>
<s> 

but unfortunately sir my time is so limited

oh </s>
<s>  interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every
thing over </s>
<s>  there is no hurry at all </s>
<s>  if it can be contrived to be at
the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses </s>
<s>  they will be
so near their own stable </s>
<s> 

so they will my dear </s>
<s>  that is a great thing </s>
<s>  not that james ever
complains </s>
<s>  but it is right to spare our horses when we can </s>
<s>  if i could
be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is <abvr> stokes to be
trusted </s>
<s>  i doubt it </s>
<s>  i do not know her even by sight </s>
<s> 

i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be
under <abvr> westons care </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston undertakes to direct the whole </s>
<s> 

there papa </s>
<s> now you must be satisfiedour own dear <abvr> weston who
is carefulness itself </s>
<s>  do not you remember what <abvr> perry said so many
years ago when i had the measles </s>
<s>  ˜if miss taylor undertakes to
wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir </s>
<s>  how often have i
heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her </s>
<s> 

aye very true </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry did say so </s>
<s>  i shall never forget it </s>
<s>  poor
little emma </s>
<s>  you were very bad with the measles </s>
<s>  that is you would have
been very bad but for perrys great attention </s>
<s>  he came four times a day
for a week </s>
<s>  he said from the first it was a very good sortwhich
was our great comfort </s>
<s>  but the measles are a dreadful complaint </s>
<s>  i hope
whenever poor isabellas little ones have the measles she will send for
perry </s>
<s> 

my father and <abvr> weston are at the crown at this moment said frank
churchill examining the capabilities of the house </s>
<s>  i left them there
and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you
might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot </s>
<s>  i was
desired to say so from both </s>
<s>  it would be the greatest pleasure to
them if you could allow me to attend you there </s>
<s>  they can do nothing
satisfactorily without you </s>
<s> 

emma was most happy to be called to such a council </s>
<s>  and her father
engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people
set off together without delay for the crown </s>
<s>  there were <abvr> and <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and
very happy in their different way </s>
<s>  she in some little distress </s>
<s>  and he
finding every thing perfect </s>
<s> 

emma said she this paper is worse than i expected </s>
<s>  look </s>
<s>  in places
you see it is dreadfully dirty </s>
<s>  and the wainscot is more yellow and
forlorn than any thing i could have imagined </s>
<s> 

my dear you are too particular said her husband </s>
<s>  what does all that
signify </s>
<s>  you will see nothing of it by candlelight </s>
<s>  it will be as
clean as randalls by candlelight </s>
<s>  we never see any thing of it on our
clubnights </s>
<s> 

the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know
when things are dirty or not </s>
<s>  and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to
himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares </s>
<s> 

one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain </s>
<s> 
it regarded a supperroom </s>
<s>  at the time of the ballrooms being built
suppers had not been in question </s>
<s>  and a small cardroom adjoining was
the only addition </s>
<s>  what was to be done </s>
<s>  this cardroom would be wanted
as a cardroom now </s>
<s>  or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary
by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable
supper </s>
<s>  another room of much better size might be secured for the
purpose </s>
<s>  but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward
passage must be gone through to get at it </s>
<s>  this made a difficulty </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage </s>
<s> 
and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being
miserably crowded at supper </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston proposed having no regular supper </s>
<s>  merely sandwiches
&c </s>
<s>  set out in the little room </s>
<s>  but that was scouted as a wretched
suggestion </s>
<s>  a private dance without sitting down to supper was
pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women </s>
<s>  and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston must not speak of it again </s>
<s>  she then took another line of
expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed

i do not think it is so very small </s>
<s>  we shall not be many you know </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through
the passage was calling out

you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear </s>
<s>  it is a
mere nothing after all </s>
<s>  and not the least draught from the stairs </s>
<s> 

i wish said <abvr> weston one could know which arrangement our guests
in general would like best </s>
<s>  to do what would be most generally pleasing
must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be </s>
<s> 

yes very true cried frank very true </s>
<s>  you want your neighbours
opinions </s>
<s>  i do not wonder at you </s>
<s>  if one could ascertain what the chief
of themthe coles for instance </s>
<s>  they are not far off </s>
<s>  shall i call
upon them </s>
<s>  or miss bates </s>
<s>  she is still nearer </s>
<s> and i do not know
whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of
the rest of the people as any body </s>
<s>  i think we do want a larger council </s>
<s> 
suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us </s>
<s> 

wellif you please said <abvr> weston rather hesitating if you think
she will be of any use </s>
<s> 

you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma </s>
<s>  she
will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing </s>
<s>  she
will not even listen to your questions </s>
<s>  i see no advantage in consulting
miss bates </s>
<s> 

but she is so amusing so extremely amusing </s>
<s>  i am very fond of hearing
miss bates talk </s>
<s>  and i need not bring the whole family you know </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it
his decided approbation </s>
<s> 

aye do frank </s>
<s> go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at
once </s>
<s>  she will enjoy the scheme i am sure </s>
<s>  and i do not know a properer
person for shewing us how to do away difficulties </s>
<s>  fetch miss bates </s>
<s> 
we are growing a little too nice </s>
<s>  she is a standing lesson of how to be
happy </s>
<s>  but fetch them both </s>
<s>  invite them both </s>
<s> 

both sir </s>
<s>  can the old lady </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

the old lady </s>
<s>  no the young lady to be sure </s>
<s>  i shall think you a great
blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon sir </s>
<s>  i did not immediately recollect </s>
<s> 
undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both </s>
<s>  and
away he ran </s>
<s> 

long before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt
and her elegant niecemrs </s>
<s>  weston like a sweettempered woman and
a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it
much less than she had supposed beforeindeed very trifling </s>
<s>  and here
ended the difficulties of decision </s>
<s>  all the rest in speculation at
least was perfectly smooth </s>
<s>  all the minor arrangements of table and
chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves </s>
<s>  or were left
as mere trifles to be settled at any time between <abvr> weston and <abvr>

chapter xii


one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely
satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within the granted
term of frank churchills stay in surry </s>
<s>  for in spite of <abvr> westons
confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the
churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his
fortnight </s>
<s>  but this was not judged feasible </s>
<s>  the preparations must take
their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were
entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and
hoping in uncertaintyat the riskin her opinion the great risk of
its being all in vain </s>
<s> 

enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word </s>
<s>  his
wish of staying longer evidently did not please </s>
<s>  but it was not opposed </s>
<s> 
all was safe and prosperous </s>
<s>  and as the removal of one solicitude
generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her
ball began to adopt as the next vexation <abvr> knightleys provoking
indifference about it </s>
<s>  either because he did not dance himself or
because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he
seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its
exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement </s>
<s> 
to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply
than

very well </s>
<s>  if the westons think it worth while to be at all this
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say
against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yes
i must be there </s>
<s>  i could not refuse </s>
<s>  and i will keep as much awake as
i can </s>
<s>  but i would rather be at home looking over william larkinss
weeks account </s>
<s>  much rather i confess </s>
<s> pleasure in seeing
dancing </s>
<s> not i indeedi never look at iti do not know who
does </s>
<s> fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward </s>
<s> 
those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very
different </s>
<s> 

this emma felt was aimed at her </s>
<s>  and it made her quite angry </s>
<s>  it was not
in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so
indignant </s>
<s>  he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball
for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree </s>
<s>  it made
her animatedopen heartedshe voluntarily said </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball </s>
<s> 
what a disappointment it would be </s>
<s>  i do look forward to it i own with
very great pleasure </s>
<s> 

it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred
the society of william larkins </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> she was more and more convinced
that <abvr> weston was quite mistaken in that surmise </s>
<s>  there was a great
deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his sidebut no
love </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>  there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  two
days of joyful security were immediately followed by the overthrow of
every thing </s>
<s>  a letter arrived from <abvr> churchill to urge his nephews
instant return </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill was unwellfar too unwell to do without
him </s>
<s>  she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband
when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual
unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of
herself she had not mentioned it </s>
<s>  but now she was too ill to trifle
and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay </s>
<s> 

the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from <abvr>
weston instantly </s>
<s>  as to his going it was inevitable </s>
<s>  he must be gone
within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt
to lessen his repugnance </s>
<s>  he knew her illnesses </s>
<s>  they never occurred but
for her own convenience </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to
highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there
whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him </s>
<s>  and that he might be
expected at hartfield very soon </s>
<s> 

this wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast </s>
<s>  when once it had
been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim </s>
<s>  the
loss of the ballthe loss of the young manand all that the young man
might be feeling </s>
<s> it was too wretched </s>
<s> such a delightful evening as
it would have been </s>
<s> every body so happy </s>
<s>  and she and her partner the
happiest </s>
<s> i said it would be so was the only consolation </s>
<s> 

her fathers feelings were quite distinct </s>
<s>  he thought principally of
mrs </s>
<s>  churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated </s>
<s>  and as
for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed </s>
<s>  but they
would all be safer at home </s>
<s> 

emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared </s>
<s>  but if this
reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want
of spirits when he did come might redeem him </s>
<s>  he felt the going away
almost too much to speak of it </s>
<s>  his dejection was most evident </s>
<s>  he
sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes </s>
<s>  and when rousing
himself it was only to say

of all horrid things leavetaking is the worst </s>
<s> 

but you will come again said emma </s>
<s>  this will not be your only visit
to randalls </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> shaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able to
return </s>
<s> i shall try for it with a zeal </s>
<s> it will be the object of
all my thoughts and cares </s>
<s> and if my uncle and aunt go to town this
springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last springi am afraid it
is a custom gone for ever </s>
<s> 

our poor ball must be quite given up </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  that ball </s>
<s> why did we wait for any thing </s>
<s> why not seize the
pleasure at once </s>
<s> how often is happiness destroyed by preparation
foolish preparation </s>
<s> you told us it would be so </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse
why are you always so right </s>
<s> 

indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance </s>
<s>  i would much
rather have been merry than wise </s>
<s> 

if i can come again we are still to have our ball </s>
<s>  my father depends
on it </s>
<s>  do not forget your engagement </s>
<s> 

emma looked graciously </s>
<s> 

such a fortnight as it has been </s>
<s>  he continued </s>
<s>  every day more
precious and more delightful than the day before </s>
<s> every day making
me less fit to bear any other place </s>
<s>  happy those who can remain at
highbury </s>
<s> 

as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will
venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first </s>
<s> 
do not we rather surpass your expectations </s>
<s>  i am sure we do </s>
<s>  i am sure
you did not much expect to like us </s>
<s>  you would not have been so long in
coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury </s>
<s> 

he laughed rather consciously </s>
<s>  and though denying the sentiment emma
was convinced that it had been so </s>
<s> 

and you must be off this very morning </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  my father is to join me here </s>
<s>  we shall walk back together and i
must be off immediately </s>
<s>  i am almost afraid that every moment will bring
him </s>
<s> 

not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss
bates </s>
<s>  how unlucky </s>
<s>  miss batess powerful argumentative mind might have
strengthened yours </s>
<s> 

yesi have called there </s>
<s>  passing the door i thought it better </s>
<s>  it
was a right thing to do </s>
<s>  i went in for three minutes and was detained
by miss batess being absent </s>
<s>  she was out </s>
<s>  and i felt it impossible not
to wait till she came in </s>
<s>  she is a woman that one may that one must
laugh at </s>
<s>  but that one would not wish to slight </s>
<s>  it was better to pay my
visit then

he hesitated got up walked to a window </s>
<s> 

in short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can hardly be
quite without suspicion

he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts </s>
<s>  she hardly knew
what to say </s>
<s>  it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely
serious which she did not wish </s>
<s>  forcing herself to speak therefore in
the hope of putting it by she calmly said

you are quite in the right </s>
<s>  it was most natural to pay your visit
then

he was silent </s>
<s>  she believed he was looking at her </s>
<s>  probably reflecting
on what she had said and trying to understand the manner </s>
<s>  she heard
him sigh </s>
<s>  it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh </s>
<s> 
he could not believe her to be encouraging him </s>
<s>  a few awkward moments
passed and he sat down again </s>
<s>  and in a more determined manner said

it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to
hartfield </s>
<s>  my regard for hartfield is most warm

he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed </s>
<s> he was more
in love with her than emma had supposed </s>
<s>  and who can say how it might
have ended if his father had not made his appearance </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse
soon followed </s>
<s>  and the necessity of exertion made him composed </s>
<s> 

a very few minutes more however completed the present trial </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of
procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that
was doubtful said it was time to go </s>
<s>  and the young man though he
might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave </s>
<s> 

i shall hear about you all said he </s>
<s>  that is my chief consolation </s>
<s> 
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you </s>
<s>  i have engaged
mrs </s>
<s>  weston to correspond with me </s>
<s>  she has been so kind as to promise
it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really
interested in the absent </s>
<s> she will tell me every thing </s>
<s>  in her letters
i shall be at dear highbury again </s>
<s> 

a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye closed the
speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill </s>
<s>  short had been
the noticeshort their meeting </s>
<s>  he was gone </s>
<s>  and emma felt so sorry
to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his
absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too
much </s>
<s> 

it was a sad change </s>
<s>  they had been meeting almost every day since his
arrival </s>
<s>  certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to
the last two weeksindescribable spirit </s>
<s>  the idea the expectation
of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his
attentions his liveliness his manners </s>
<s>  it had been a very happy
fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common
course of hartfield days </s>
<s>  to complete every other recommendation he had
almost told her that he loved her </s>
<s>  what strength or what constancy of
affection he might be subject to was another point </s>
<s>  but at present
she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious
preference of herself </s>
<s>  and this persuasion joined to all the rest
made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of
every previous determination against it </s>
<s> 

i certainly must said she </s>
<s>  this sensation of listlessness
weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself
this feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house </s>
<s> 
i must be in love </s>
<s>  i should be the oddest creature in the world if i
were notfor a few weeks at least </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  evil to some is always good to
others </s>
<s>  i shall have many fellowmourners for the ball if not for frank
churchill </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley will be happy </s>
<s>  he may spend the evening
with his dear william larkins now if he likes </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness </s>
<s>  he could not say
that he was sorry on his own account </s>
<s>  his very cheerful look would have
contradicted him if he had </s>
<s>  but he said and very steadily that he
was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable
kindness added

you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out
of luck </s>
<s>  you are very much out of luck </s>
<s> 

it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest
regret in this woeful change </s>
<s>  but when they did meet her composure
was odious </s>
<s>  she had been particularly unwell however suffering from
headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball
taken place she did not think jane could have attended it </s>
<s>  and it was
charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of
illhealth </s>
<s> 



chapter xiii


emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love </s>
<s>  her ideas
only varied as to the how much </s>
<s>  at first she thought it was a good
deal </s>
<s>  and afterwards but little </s>
<s>  she had great pleasure in hearing
frank churchill talked of </s>
<s>  and for his sake greater pleasure than ever
in seeing <abvr> and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she was very often thinking of him and
quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were
his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to
randalls again this spring </s>
<s>  but on the other hand she could not admit
herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed
for employment than usual </s>
<s>  she was still busy and cheerful </s>
<s>  and
pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults </s>
<s>  and
farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or
working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close
of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing
elegant letters </s>
<s>  the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his
side was that she refused him </s>
<s>  their affection was always to subside
into friendship </s>
<s>  every thing tender and charming was to mark their
parting </s>
<s>  but still they were to part </s>
<s>  when she became sensible of this
it struck her that she could not be very much in love </s>
<s>  for in spite of
her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never
to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle
than she could foresee in her own feelings </s>
<s> 

i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said
she </s>
<s> in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is
there any allusion to making a sacrifice </s>
<s>  i do suspect that he is not
really necessary to my happiness </s>
<s>  so much the better </s>
<s>  i certainly will
not persuade myself to feel more than i do </s>
<s>  i am quite enough in love </s>
<s>  i
should be sorry to be more </s>
<s> 

upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings </s>
<s> 

he is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery
much in love indeed </s>
<s> and when he comes again if his affection
continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it </s>
<s> it would be most
inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up </s>
<s>  not that i
imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto </s>
<s>  no if he
had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been
so wretched </s>
<s>  could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and
language at parting would have been different </s>
<s> still however i must
be on my guard </s>
<s>  this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing
what it now is </s>
<s>  but i do not know that i expect it will </s>
<s>  i do not look
upon him to be quite the sort of mani do not altogether build upon
his steadiness or constancy </s>
<s> his feelings are warm but i can imagine
them rather changeable </s>
<s> every consideration of the subject in short
makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved </s>
<s> i
shall do very well again after a little whileand then it will be a
good thing over </s>
<s>  for they say every body is in love once in their lives
and i shall have been let off easily </s>
<s> 

when his letter to <abvr> weston arrived emma had the perusal of it </s>
<s>  and
she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her
at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had
undervalued their strength </s>
<s>  it was a long wellwritten letter giving
the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the
affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable
and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed
attractive with spirit and precision </s>
<s>  no suspicious flourishes now of
apology or concern </s>
<s>  it was the language of real feeling towards <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast
between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was
just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more
might have been said but for the restraints of propriety </s>
<s> the charm
of her own name was not wanting </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse appeared more than
once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a
compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said </s>
<s>  and in
the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any
such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of
her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all
conveyed </s>
<s>  compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these
wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss
woodhouses beautiful little friend </s>
<s>  pray make my excuses and adieus
to her </s>
<s>  this emma could not doubt was all for herself </s>
<s>  harriet was
remembered only from being her friend </s>
<s>  his information and prospects
as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own
imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again </s>
<s> 

gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material
part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned
to <abvr> weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could
still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her </s>
<s> 
her intentions were unchanged </s>
<s>  her resolution of refusal only grew more
interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation
and happiness </s>
<s>  his recollection of harriet and the words which
clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the
idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections </s>
<s>  was it
impossible </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in
understanding </s>
<s>  but he had been very much struck with the loveliness
of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner </s>
<s>  and all the
probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour </s>
<s> for
harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed </s>
<s> 

i must not dwell upon it said she </s>
<s> i must not think of it </s>
<s>  i know
the danger of indulging such speculations </s>
<s>  but stranger things have
happened </s>
<s>  and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it
will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested
friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure </s>
<s> 

it was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf though it
might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom </s>
<s>  for evil in that quarter
was at hand </s>
<s>  as frank churchills arrival had succeeded <abvr> eltons
engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest
had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchills
disappearance <abvr> eltons concerns were assuming the most irresistible
form </s>
<s> his weddingday was named </s>
<s>  he would soon be among them again </s>
<s>  <abvr>
elton and his bride </s>
<s>  there was hardly time to talk over the first letter
from enscombe before <abvr> elton and his bride was in every bodys
mouth and frank churchill was forgotten </s>
<s>  emma grew sick at the sound </s>
<s> 
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  and harriets
mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength </s>
<s> 
with <abvr> westons ball in view at least there had been a great deal of
insensibility to other things </s>
<s>  but it was now too evident that she had
not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual
approachnew carriage bellringing and all </s>
<s> 

poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could
give </s>
<s>  emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had
a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience </s>
<s>  but it was heavy work
to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed
to without being able to make their opinions the same </s>
<s>  harriet listened
submissively and said it was very trueit was just as miss woodhouse
describedit was not worth while to think about themand she would not
think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and
the next halfhour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as
before </s>
<s>  at last emma attacked her on another ground </s>
<s> 

your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about <abvr>
eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me </s>
<s> 
you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into </s>
<s> 
it was all my doing i know </s>
<s>  i have not forgotten it i assure
you </s>
<s> deceived myself i did very miserably deceive youand it will
be a painful reflection to me for ever </s>
<s>  do not imagine me in danger of
forgetting it </s>
<s> 

harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager
exclamation </s>
<s>  emma continued

i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake </s>
<s>  think less talk
less of <abvr> elton for my sake </s>
<s>  because for your own sake rather i
would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my
comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration of what is your
duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of
others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity </s>
<s> 
these are the motives which i have been pressing on you </s>
<s>  they are very
importantand sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act
upon them </s>
<s>  my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration </s>
<s> 
i want you to save yourself from greater pain </s>
<s>  perhaps i may sometimes
have felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what
would be kind by me </s>
<s> 

this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest </s>
<s>  the idea of
wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really
loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence
of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to
what was right and support her in it very tolerably </s>
<s> 

you who have been the best friend i ever had in my lifewant
gratitude to you </s>
<s> nobody is equal to you </s>
<s> i care for nobody as i do
for you </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been </s>
<s> 

such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and
manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so
well nor valued her affection so highly before </s>
<s> 

there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to
herself </s>
<s>  there is nothing to be compared to it </s>
<s>  warmth and tenderness
of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the
clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will </s>
<s>  it
is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally
belovedwhich gives isabella all her popularity </s>
<s> i have it notbut
i know how to prize and respect it </s>
<s> harriet is my superior in all the
charm and all the felicity it gives </s>
<s>  dear harriet </s>
<s> i would not change
you for the clearestheaded longestsighted bestjudging female
breathing </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the coldness of a jane fairfax </s>
<s> harriet is worth a
hundred suchand for a wifea sensible mans wifeit is invaluable </s>
<s>  i
mention no names </s>
<s>  but happy the man who changes emma for harriet </s>

chapter xiv


mrs </s>
<s>  elton was first seen at church </s>
<s>  but though devotion might be
interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and
it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to
settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or
not pretty at all </s>
<s> 

emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make
her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects </s>
<s>  and she made a
point of harriets going with her that the worst of the business might
be gone through as soon as possible </s>
<s> 

she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to
which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to
lace up her boot without recollecting </s>
<s>  a thousand vexatious thoughts
would recur </s>
<s>  compliments charades and horrible blunders </s>
<s>  and it was
not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too </s>
<s>  but
she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent </s>
<s>  the visit
was of course short </s>
<s>  and there was so much embarrassment and occupation
of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to
form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the
nothingmeaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing </s>
<s> 

she did not really like her </s>
<s>  she would not be in a hurry to find fault
but she suspected that there was no elegance </s>
<s> ease but not elegance </s>
<s> 
she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there
was too much ease </s>
<s>  her person was rather good </s>
<s>  her face not unpretty </s>
<s> 
but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant </s>
<s>  emma
thought at least it would turn out so </s>
<s> 

as for <abvr> elton his manners did not appearbut no she would not
permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners </s>
<s>  it was an
awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man
had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it </s>
<s>  the woman
was better off </s>
<s>  she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the
privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to
depend on </s>
<s>  and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor <abvr>
elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just
married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had
been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as
little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as
could be </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the
house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin </s>
<s>  well miss
woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her </s>

there was a little hesitation in emmas answer </s>

perhaps she might </s>

superior as ever </s>
<s> but being married you know it is quite a different
thing </s>
<s>  no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid </s>
<s>  i can sit and
admire him now without any great misery </s>
<s>  to know that he has not thrown
himself away is such a comfort </s>
<s> she does seem a charming young woman
just what he deserves </s>
<s>  happy creature </s>
<s>  he called her ˜augusta </s>
<s>  how
delightful </s>
<s> 

when the visit was returned emma made up her mind </s>
<s>  she could then see
more and judge better </s>
<s>  from harriets happening not to be at hartfield
and her fathers being present to engage <abvr> elton she had a quarter
of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself and could composedly
attend to her </s>
<s>  and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that
mrs </s>
<s>  elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and
thinking much of her own importance </s>
<s>  that she meant to shine and be very
superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert
and familiar </s>
<s>  that all her notions were drawn from one set of people
and one style of living </s>
<s>  that if not foolish she was ignorant and that
her society would certainly do <abvr> elton no good </s>
<s> 

harriet would have been a better match </s>
<s>  if not wise or refined herself
she would have connected him with those who were </s>
<s>  but miss hawkins it
might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of
her own set </s>
<s>  the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride of the
alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him </s>
<s> 

the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother
mr </s>
<s>  sucklings seat </s>
<s> a comparison of hartfield to maple grove </s>
<s>  the
grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty </s>
<s>  and the house was
modern and wellbuilt </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton seemed most favourably impressed
by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or
imagine </s>
<s>  very like maple grove indeed </s>
<s> she was quite struck by the
likeness </s>
<s> that room was the very shape and size of the morningroom
at maple grove </s>
<s>  her sisters favourite room </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton was appealed
to </s>
<s> was not it astonishingly like </s>
<s> she could really almost fancy
herself at maple grove </s>
<s> 

and the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like the
staircase was </s>
<s>  placed exactly in the same part of the house </s>
<s>  i really
could not help exclaiming </s>
<s>  i assure you miss woodhouse it is very
delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to
as maple grove </s>
<s>  i have spent so many happy months there </s>
<s>  with a little
sigh of sentiment </s>
<s>  a charming place undoubtedly </s>
<s>  every body who
sees it is struck by its beauty </s>
<s>  but to me it has been quite a home </s>
<s> 
whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will
understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like
what one has left behind </s>
<s>  i always say this is quite one of the evils of
matrimony </s>
<s> 

emma made as slight a reply as she could </s>
<s>  but it was fully sufficient
for <abvr> elton who only wanted to be talking herself </s>
<s> 

so extremely like maple grove </s>
<s>  and it is not merely the housethe
grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like </s>
<s> 
the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand
very much in the same wayjust across the lawn </s>
<s>  and i had a glimpse
of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in
mind </s>
<s>  my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place </s>
<s>  people
who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing
in the same style </s>
<s> 

emma doubted the truth of this sentiment </s>
<s>  she had a great idea that
people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the
extensive grounds of any body else </s>
<s>  but it was not worth while to attack
an error so doubledyed and therefore only said in reply

when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you
have overrated hartfield </s>
<s>  surry is full of beauties </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i am quite aware of that </s>
<s>  it is the garden of england you
know </s>
<s>  surry is the garden of england </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction </s>
<s>  many
counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as
surry </s>
<s> 

no i fancy not replied <abvr> elton with a most satisfied smile </s>
<s> 
i never heard any county but surry called so </s>
<s> 

emma was silenced </s>
<s> 

my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer
at farthest continued <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  and that will be our time for
exploring </s>
<s>  while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare
say </s>
<s>  they will have their barouchelandau of course which holds four
perfectly </s>
<s>  and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage
we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well </s>
<s>  they
would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the
year </s>
<s>  indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their
bringing the barouchelandau </s>
<s>  it will be so very much preferable </s>
<s> 
when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss
woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
suckling is extremely fond of exploring </s>
<s>  we explored to kingsweston
twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their
first having the barouchelandau </s>
<s>  you have many parties of that kind
here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  not immediately here </s>
<s>  we are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of </s>
<s>  and we
are a very quiet set of people i believe </s>
<s>  more disposed to stay at home
than engage in schemes of pleasure </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort </s>
<s>  nobody can
be more devoted to home than i am </s>
<s>  i was quite a proverb for it at maple
grove </s>
<s>  many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol
˜i really cannot get this girl to move from the house </s>
<s>  i absolutely must
go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouchelandau
without a companion </s>
<s>  but augusta i believe with her own goodwill
would never stir beyond the park paling </s>
<s>  many a time has she said so </s>
<s> 
and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion </s>
<s>  i think on the contrary
when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very
bad thing </s>
<s>  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little </s>
<s>  i
perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouselooking
towards <abvr> woodhouse your fathers state of health must be a great
drawback </s>
<s>  why does not he try bath </s>
<s> indeed he should </s>
<s>  let me recommend
bath to you </s>
<s>  i assure you i have no doubt of its doing <abvr> woodhouse
good </s>
<s> 

my father tried it more than once formerly </s>
<s>  but without receiving any
benefit </s>
<s>  and <abvr> perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you
does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thats a great pity </s>
<s>  for i assure you miss woodhouse where the
waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give </s>
<s>  in my bath
life i have seen such instances of it </s>
<s>  and it is so cheerful a place
that it could not fail of being of use to <abvr> woodhouses spirits
which i understand are sometimes much depressed </s>
<s>  and as to its
recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell
on them </s>
<s>  the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally
understood </s>
<s>  it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived
so secluded a life </s>
<s>  and i could immediately secure you some of the best
society in the place </s>
<s>  a line from me would bring you a little host of
acquaintance </s>
<s>  and my particular friend <abvr> partridge the lady i have
always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any
attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public
with </s>
<s> 

it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite </s>
<s>  the idea
of her being indebted to <abvr> elton for what was called an
introductionof her going into public under the auspices of a friend
of <abvr> eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow who with the
help of a boarder just made a shift to live </s>
<s> the dignity of miss
woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed </s>
<s> 

she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have
given and only thanked <abvr> elton coolly </s>
<s>  but their going to bath was
quite out of the question </s>
<s>  and she was not perfectly convinced that
the place might suit her better than her father </s>
<s>  and then to prevent
farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly </s>
<s> 

i do not ask whether you are musical <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  upon these occasions
a ladys character generally precedes her </s>
<s>  and highbury has long known
that you are a superior performer </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s>  i must protest against any such idea </s>
<s>  a superior
performer </s>
<s> very far from it i assure you </s>
<s>  consider from how partial
a quarter your information came </s>
<s>  i am doatingly fond of
musicpassionately fond </s>
<s> and my friends say i am not entirely devoid
of taste </s>
<s>  but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is
mediocre to the last degree </s>
<s>  you miss woodhouse i well know play
delightfully </s>
<s>  i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction
comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got
into </s>
<s>  i absolutely cannot do without music </s>
<s>  it is a necessary of life to
me </s>
<s>  and having always been used to a very musical society both at
maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice </s>
<s>  i
honestly said as much to <abvr> e </s>
<s>  when he was speaking of my future
home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be
disagreeable </s>
<s>  and the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had
been accustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension </s>
<s> 
when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the
world i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear of
retirement </s>
<s>  blessed with so many resources within myself the world was
not necessary to me </s>
<s>  i could do very well without it </s>
<s>  to those who had
no resources it was a different thing </s>
<s>  but my resources made me quite
independent </s>
<s>  and as to smallersized rooms than i had been used to i
really could not give it a thought </s>
<s>  i hoped i was perfectly equal to any
sacrifice of that description </s>
<s>  certainly i had been accustomed to every
luxury at maple grove </s>
<s>  but i did assure him that two carriages were not
necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments </s>
<s>  ˜but said i
˜to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a
musical society </s>
<s>  i condition for nothing else </s>
<s>  but without music life
would be a blank to me </s>
<s> 

we cannot suppose said emma smiling that <abvr> elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury </s>
<s>  and
i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be
pardoned in consideration of the motive </s>
<s> 

no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head </s>
<s>  i am delighted to
find myself in such a circle </s>
<s>  i hope we shall have many sweet little
concerts together </s>
<s>  i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a
musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours </s>
<s> 
will not it be a good plan </s>
<s>  if we exert ourselves i think we shall
not be long in want of allies </s>
<s>  something of that nature would be
particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in
practice </s>
<s>  for married women you knowthere is a sad story against
them in general </s>
<s>  they are but too apt to give up music </s>
<s> 

but you who are so extremely fond of itthere can be no danger
surely </s>
<s> 

i should hope not </s>
<s>  but really when i look around among my acquaintance
i tremble </s>
<s>  selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the
instrumentthough she played sweetly </s>
<s>  and the same may be said of <abvr>
jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of the two milmans now <abvr>
bird and <abvr> james cooper </s>
<s>  and of more than i can enumerate </s>
<s>  upon my
word it is enough to put one in a fright </s>
<s>  i used to be quite angry with
selina </s>
<s>  but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has
many things to call her attention </s>
<s>  i believe i was half an hour this
morning shut up with my housekeeper </s>
<s> 

but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a
train

well said <abvr> elton laughing we shall see </s>
<s> 

emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing
more to say </s>
<s>  and after a moments pause <abvr> elton chose another
subject </s>
<s> 

we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at
home </s>
<s>  and very pleasant people they seem to be </s>
<s>  i like them extremely </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  weston seems an excellent creaturequite a firstrate favourite
with me already i assure you </s>
<s>  and she appears so truly goodthere is
something so motherly and kindhearted about her that it wins upon one
directly </s>
<s>  she was your governess i think </s>
<s> 

emma was almost too much astonished to answer </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton hardly
waited for the affirmative before she went on </s>
<s> 

having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very
ladylike </s>
<s>  but she is really quite the gentlewoman </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  westons manners said emma were always particularly good </s>
<s> 
their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest
model for any young woman </s>
<s> 

and who do you think came in while we were there </s>
<s> 

emma was quite at a loss </s>
<s>  the tone implied some old acquaintanceand
how could she possibly guess </s>
<s> 

knightley </s>
<s>  continued <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  knightley himself </s>
<s> was not it
lucky </s>
<s> for not being within when he called the other day i had never
seen him before </s>
<s>  and of course as so particular a friend of <abvr> e </s>
<s> s
i had a great curiosity </s>

caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend </s>

knightley is quite the gentleman </s>
<s>  i like him very much </s>
<s>  decidedly i
think a very gentlemanlike man </s>
<s> 

happily it was now time to be gone </s>
<s>  they were off </s>
<s>  and emma could
breathe </s>
<s> 

insufferable woman </s>
<s>  was her immediate exclamation </s>
<s>  worse than i had
supposed </s>
<s>  absolutely insufferable </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> i could not have
believed it </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> never seen him in her life before and call
him knightley </s>
<s> and discover that he is a gentleman </s>
<s>  a little upstart
vulgar being with her <abvr> e </s>
<s>  and her caro sposo and her
resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery </s>
<s> 
actually to discover that <abvr> knightley is a gentleman </s>
<s>  i doubt whether
he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady </s>
<s>  i could
not have believed it </s>
<s>  and to propose that she and i should unite to
form a musical club </s>
<s>  one would fancy we were bosom friends </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
weston </s>
<s> astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a
gentlewoman </s>
<s>  worse and worse </s>
<s>  i never met with her equal </s>
<s>  much beyond
my hopes </s>
<s>  harriet is disgraced by any comparison </s>

<s>  what would frank
churchill say to her if he were here </s>
<s>  how angry and how diverted he
would be </s>

<s>  there i amthinking of him directly </s>
<s>  always the first
person to be thought of </s>
<s>  how i catch myself out </s>
<s>  frank churchill comes
as regularly into my mind </s>
<s> 

all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father
had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was
ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending </s>
<s> 

well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her
before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady </s>
<s>  and i dare say she
was very much pleased with you </s>
<s>  she speaks a little too quick </s>
<s>  a little
quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear </s>
<s>  but i believe
i am nice </s>
<s>  i do not like strange voices </s>
<s>  and nobody speaks like you and
poor miss taylor </s>
<s>  however she seems a very obliging prettybehaved
young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife </s>
<s>  though i think
he had better not have married </s>
<s>  i made the best excuses i could for not
having been able to wait on him and <abvr> elton on this happy occasion </s>
<s>  i
said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer </s>
<s>  but i ought to
have gone before </s>
<s>  not to wait upon a bride is very remiss </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  it shews
what a sad invalid i am </s>
<s>  but i do not like the corner into vicarage
lane </s>
<s> 

i dare say your apologies were accepted sir </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton knows you </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects to her
if possible </s>
<s>  it was being very deficient </s>
<s> 

but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony </s>
<s>  and therefore why
should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride </s>
<s>  it ought to
be no recommendation to you </s>
<s>  it is encouraging people to marry if you
make so much of them </s>
<s> 

no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always
wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride especially
is never to be neglected </s>
<s>  more is avowedly due to her </s>
<s>  a bride you
know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who
they may </s>
<s> 

well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what
is </s>
<s>  and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to
such vanitybaits for poor young ladies </s>
<s> 

my dear you do not understand me </s>
<s>  this is a matter of mere
common politeness and goodbreeding and has nothing to do with any
encouragement to people to marry </s>

emma had done </s>

her </s>

chapter xv


emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill
opinion of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  her observation had been pretty correct </s>
<s>  such as
mrs </s>
<s>  elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared
whenever they met againselfimportant presuming familiar ignorant
and illbred </s>
<s>  she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment
but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior
knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood </s>
<s> 
and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as <abvr>
eltons consequence only could surpass </s>
<s> 

there was no reason to suppose <abvr> elton thought at all differently from
his wife </s>
<s>  he seemed not merely happy with her but proud </s>
<s>  he had the air
of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury
as not even miss woodhouse could equal </s>
<s>  and the greater part of her
new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging
following the lead of miss batess goodwill or taking it for granted
that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed
herself were very well satisfied </s>
<s>  so that <abvr> eltons praise
passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss
woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with
a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed </s>
<s> 

in one respect <abvr> elton grew even worse than she had appeared at
first </s>
<s>  her feelings altered towards emma </s>
<s> offended probably by the
little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew
back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant </s>
<s>  and
though the effect was agreeable the illwill which produced it was
necessarily increasing emmas dislike </s>
<s>  her manners tooand <abvr>
eltons were unpleasant towards harriet </s>
<s>  they were sneering and
negligent </s>
<s>  emma hoped it must rapidly work harriets cure </s>
<s>  but the
sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very
much </s>
<s> it was not to be doubted that poor harriets attachment had been
an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under
a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him
had in all likelihood been given also </s>
<s>  she was of course the object
of their joint dislike </s>
<s> when they had nothing else to say it must be
always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  and the enmity which
they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in
contemptuous treatment of harriet </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and from the first </s>
<s>  not
merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to
recommend the other but from the very first </s>
<s>  and she was not satisfied
with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationbut without
solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and
befriend her </s>
<s> before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the
third time of their meeting she heard all <abvr> eltons knighterrantry
on the subject </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse </s>
<s> i quite rave
about jane fairfax </s>
<s> a sweet interesting creature </s>
<s>  so mild and
ladylikeand with such talents </s>
<s> i assure you i think she has very
extraordinary talents </s>
<s>  i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely
well </s>
<s>  i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she
is absolutely charming </s>
<s>  you will laugh at my warmthbut upon my word
i talk of nothing but jane fairfax </s>
<s> and her situation is so calculated
to affect one </s>
<s> miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour
to do something for her </s>
<s>  we must bring her forward </s>
<s>  such talent as hers
must not be suffered to remain unknown </s>
<s> i dare say you have heard those
charming lines of the poet

        ˜full many a flower is born to blush unseen
          ˜and waste its fragrance on the desert air </s>
<s> 

we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

i cannot think there is any danger of it was emmas calm answerand
when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation and
understand what her home has been with colonel and <abvr> campbell i
have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such
obscurity so thrown away </s>
<s> whatever advantages she may have enjoyed
with the campbells are so palpably at an end </s>
<s>  and i think she feels it </s>
<s> 
i am sure she does </s>
<s>  she is very timid and silent </s>
<s>  one can see that she
feels the want of encouragement </s>
<s>  i like her the better for it </s>
<s>  i
must confess it is a recommendation to me </s>
<s>  i am a great advocate for
timidityand i am sure one does not often meet with it </s>
<s> but in those
who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  i assure
you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more
than i can express </s>
<s> 

you appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any of
miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer
than yourself can shew her any other attention than

my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to
act </s>
<s>  you and i need not be afraid </s>
<s>  if we set the example many will
follow it as far as they can </s>
<s>  though all have not our situations </s>
<s>  we
have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style
which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the
least inconvenient </s>
<s> i should be extremely displeased if wright were to
send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more
than jane fairfax to partake of it </s>
<s>  i have no idea of that sort of
thing </s>
<s>  it is not likely that i should considering what i have been
used to </s>
<s>  my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the
other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense </s>
<s>  maple
grove will probably be my model more than it ought to befor we do not
at all affect to equal my brother <abvr> suckling in income </s>
<s> however my
resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax </s>
<s> i shall certainly have
her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall
have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly
on the watch for an eligible situation </s>
<s>  my acquaintance is so very
extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit
her shortly </s>
<s> i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my
brother and sister when they come to us </s>
<s>  i am sure they will like her
extremely </s>
<s>  and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears
will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners
of either but what is highly conciliating </s>
<s> i shall have her very often
indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a
seat for her in the barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties </s>

<s>  the change on <abvr> eltons side soon afterwards appeared
and she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular

way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done </s>

simplicity and warmth </s>

was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate <abvr>
elton as she seemed to do </s>

sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons </s>
<s>  this was
astonishing </s>
<s> she could not have believed it possible that the taste or
the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as

were gone to ireland for three months </s>
<s>  but now the campbells had
promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh
invitations had arrived for her to join them there </s>
<s>  according to miss
batesit all came from hermrs </s>
<s>  dixon had written most pressingly </s>
<s> 
would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends
contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist </s>
<s>  but still she had
declined it </s>
<s> 

she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing
this invitation was emmas conclusion </s>
<s>  she must be under some sort
of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself </s>
<s>  there is great
fear great caution great resolution somewhere </s>
<s> she is not to be
with the dixons </s>
<s>  the decree is issued by somebody </s>
<s>  but why must she
consent to be with the eltons </s>
<s> here is quite a separate puzzle </s>
<s> 

upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before
the few who knew her opinion of <abvr> elton <abvr> weston ventured this
apology for jane </s>
<s> 

we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage
my dear emmabut it is better than being always at home </s>
<s>  her aunt is a
good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome </s>
<s>  we
must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for
what she goes to </s>
<s> 

you are right <abvr> weston said <abvr> knightley warmly miss fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 
could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen
her </s>
<s>  but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from
mrs </s>
<s>  elton which nobody else pays her </s>
<s> 

emma felt that <abvr> weston was giving her a momentary glance </s>
<s>  and she
was herself struck by his warmth </s>
<s>  with a faint blush she presently
replied

such attentions as <abvr> eltons i should have imagined would rather
disgust than gratify miss fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons invitations i should
have imagined any thing but inviting </s>
<s> 

i should not wonder said <abvr> weston if miss fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness in
accepting <abvr> eltons civilities for her </s>
<s>  poor miss bates may
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in
spite of the very natural wish of a little change </s>
<s> 

both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again </s>
<s>  and after a few
minutes silence he said

another thing must be taken into consideration toomrs </s>
<s>  elton does
not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her </s>
<s>  we all know the
difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken
amongst us </s>
<s>  we all feel the influence of a something beyond common
civility in our personal intercourse with each othera something more
early implanted </s>
<s>  we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we
may have been very full of the hour before </s>
<s>  we feel things differently </s>
<s> 
and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be
sure that miss fairfax awes <abvr> elton by her superiority both of mind
and manner </s>
<s>  and that face to face <abvr> elton treats her with all the
respect which she has a claim to </s>
<s>  such a woman as jane fairfax probably
never fell in <abvr> eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can
prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if
not in consciousness </s>
<s> 

i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma </s>
<s>  little henry
was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her
irresolute what else to say </s>
<s> 

yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her </s>
<s> 

and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon
stoppingit was better however to know the worst at onceshe hurried
onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it
is </s>
<s>  the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or
other </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick
leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or
some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered

oh </s>
<s>  are you there </s>
<s> but you are miserably behindhand </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole gave me
a hint of it six weeks ago </s>
<s> 

he stopped </s>
<s> emma felt her foot pressed by <abvr> weston and did not
herself know what to think </s>
<s>  in a moment he went on

that will never be however i can assure you </s>
<s>  miss fairfax i dare
say would not have me if i were to ask herand i am very sure i shall
never ask her </s>
<s> 

emma returned her friends pressure with interest </s>
<s>  and was pleased
enough to exclaim

you are not vain <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i will say that for you </s>
<s> 

he seemed hardly to hear her </s>
<s>  he was thoughtfuland in a manner which
shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said

so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

no indeed i have not </s>
<s>  you have scolded me too much for matchmaking
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you </s>
<s>  what i said just now
meant nothing </s>
<s>  one says those sort of things of course without any
idea of a serious meaning </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  no upon my word i have not the smallest
wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body </s>
<s>  you would not come
in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was thoughtful again </s>
<s>  the result of his reverie was no
emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take
me by surprize </s>
<s> i never had a thought of her in that way i assure
you </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young
womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect </s>
<s>  she has a fault </s>
<s>  she has
not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife </s>
<s> 

emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault </s>
<s>  well said
she and you soon silenced <abvr> cole i suppose </s>
<s> 

yes very soon </s>
<s>  he gave me a quiet hint </s>
<s>  i told him he was mistaken </s>
<s> 
he asked my pardon and said no more </s>
<s>  cole does not want to be wiser or
wittier than his neighbours </s>
<s> 

in that respect how unlike dear <abvr> elton who wants to be wiser and
wittier than all the world </s>
<s>  i wonder how she speaks of the coleswhat
she calls them </s>
<s>  how can she find any appellation for them deep enough
in familiar vulgarity </s>
<s>  she calls you knightleywhat can she do for
mr </s>
<s>  cole </s>
<s>  and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts
her civilities and consents to be with her </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston your argument
weighs most with me </s>
<s>  i can much more readily enter into the temptation
of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of
miss fairfaxs mind over <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  i have no faith in <abvr> eltons
acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed </s>
<s>  or in her
being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding </s>
<s> 
i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor
with praise encouragement and offers of service </s>
<s>  that she will not be
continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her
a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring
parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax has feeling said <abvr> knightleyi do not accuse her
of want of feeling </s>
<s>  her sensibilities i suspect are strongand her
temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience selfcontrol </s>
<s> 
but it wants openness </s>
<s>  she is reserved more reserved i think than
she used to beand i love an open temper </s>
<s>  notill cole alluded to my
supposed attachment it had never entered my head </s>
<s>  i saw jane fairfax
and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no
thought beyond </s>
<s> 

well <abvr> weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do
you say now to <abvr> knightleys marrying jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the
idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it
were to end in his being so at last </s>
<s>  do not beat me </s>

chapter xvi


every body in and about highbury who had ever visited <abvr> elton was
disposed to pay him attention on his marriage </s>
<s>  dinnerparties and
eveningparties were made for him and his lady </s>
<s>  and invitations flowed
in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were
never to have a disengaged day </s>
<s> 

i see how it is said she </s>
<s>  i see what a life i am to lead among you </s>
<s> 
upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated </s>
<s>  we really seem quite
the fashion </s>
<s>  if this is living in the country it is nothing very
formidable </s>
<s>  from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a
disengaged day </s>
<s> a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have
been at a loss </s>
<s> 

no invitation came amiss to her </s>
<s>  her bath habits made eveningparties
perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for
dinners </s>
<s>  she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at
the poor attempt at routcakes and there being no ice in the highbury
cardparties </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates <abvr> perry <abvr> goddard and others were a
good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew
them how every thing ought to be arranged </s>
<s>  in the course of the spring
she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which
her cardtables should be set out with their separate candles and
unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the
evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the
refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order </s>
<s> 

emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at
hartfield for the eltons </s>
<s>  they must not do less than others or she
should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful
resentment </s>
<s>  a dinner there must be </s>
<s>  after emma had talked about it for
ten minutes <abvr> woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the
usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself
with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him </s>
<s> 

the persons to be invited required little thought </s>
<s>  besides the
eltons it must be the westons and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  so far it was all of
courseand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must
be asked to make the eighth </s>
<s> but this invitation was not given with
equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased
by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it </s>
<s>  she would rather not
be in his company more than she could help </s>
<s>  she was not yet quite
able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling
uncomfortable </s>
<s>  if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would
rather stay at home </s>
<s>  it was precisely what emma would have wished had
she deemed it possible enough for wishing </s>
<s>  she was delighted with the
fortitude of her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to
give up being in company and stay at home </s>
<s>  and she could now invite the
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax </s>
<s> 
since her last conversation with <abvr> weston and <abvr> knightley she
was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had often
been </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightleys words dwelt with her </s>
<s>  he had said that jane
fairfax received attentions from <abvr> elton which nobody else paid her </s>
<s> 

this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which
was all that was meantand it is very shameful </s>
<s> of the same ageand
always knowing heri ought to have been more her friend </s>
<s> she will
never like me now </s>
<s>  i have neglected her too long </s>
<s>  but i will shew her
greater attention than i have done </s>
<s> 

every invitation was successful </s>
<s>  they were all disengaged and all
happy </s>
<s> the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet
over </s>
<s>  a circumstance rather unlucky occurred </s>
<s>  the two eldest little
knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some
weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and
staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be the very day
of this party </s>
<s> his professional engagements did not allow of his being
put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening
so </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the
utmost that his nerves could bearand here would be a ninthand emma
apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not
being able to come even to hartfield for fortyeight hours without
falling in with a dinnerparty </s>
<s> 

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by
representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet
he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very
immaterial </s>
<s>  she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to
have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her
instead of his brother </s>
<s> 

the event was more favourable to <abvr> woodhouse than to emma </s>
<s>  john
knightley came </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and
must be absent on the very day </s>
<s>  he might be able to join them in the
evening but certainly not to dinner </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse was quite at ease </s>
<s> 
and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the
philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the
chief of even emmas vexation </s>
<s> 

the day came the party were punctually assembled and <abvr> john
knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being
agreeable </s>
<s>  instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they
waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton
as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in
silencewanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut
miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk
to her </s>
<s>  he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk
with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain </s>
<s>  it was
natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said

i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am
sure you must have been wet </s>
<s> we scarcely got home in time </s>
<s>  i hope you
turned directly </s>
<s> 

i went only to the postoffice said she and reached home before the
rain was much </s>
<s>  it is my daily errand </s>
<s>  i always fetch the letters when
i am here </s>
<s>  it saves trouble and is a something to get me out </s>
<s>  a walk
before breakfast does me good </s>
<s> 

not a walk in the rain i should imagine </s>
<s> 

no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley smiled and replied

that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards
from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you </s>
<s>  and henry
and john had seen more drops than they could count long before </s>
<s>  the
postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives </s>
<s>  when you have
lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going
through the rain for </s>
<s> 

there was a little blush and then this answer

i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every
dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing
older should make me indifferent about letters </s>
<s> 

indifferent </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  noi never conceived you could become indifferent </s>
<s> 
letters are no matter of indifference </s>
<s>  they are generally a very
positive curse </s>
<s> 

you are speaking of letters of business </s>
<s>  mine are letters of
friendship </s>
<s> 

i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly </s>
<s> 
business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you are not serious now </s>
<s>  i know <abvr> john knightley too welli am
very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body </s>
<s>  i
can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than
to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which
makes the difference it is not age but situation </s>
<s>  you have every
body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again </s>
<s> 
and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a postoffice
i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than
today </s>
<s> 

when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years
 said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which
time usually brings </s>
<s>  i consider one as including the other </s>
<s>  time will
generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily
circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you </s>
<s>  as an old
friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence
you may have as many concentrated objects as i have </s>
<s> 

it was kindly said and very far from giving offence </s>
<s>  a pleasant thank
you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear
in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh </s>
<s>  her attention was
now claimed by <abvr> woodhouse who being according to his custom on such
occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular
compliments to the ladies was ending with herand with all his mildest
urbanity said

i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning
in the rain </s>
<s>  young ladies should take care of themselves </s>
<s> young ladies
are delicate plants </s>
<s>  they should take care of their health and their
complexion </s>
<s>  my dear did you change your stockings </s>
<s> 

yes sir i did indeed </s>
<s>  and i am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me </s>
<s> 

my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for </s>
<s> i
hope your good grandmama and aunt are well </s>
<s>  they are some of my very
old friends </s>
<s>  i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour </s>
<s>  you
do us a great deal of honour today i am sure </s>
<s>  my daughter and i
are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest
satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield </s>
<s> 

the kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he
had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy </s>
<s> 

by this time the walk in the rain had reached <abvr> elton and her
remonstrances now opened upon jane </s>
<s> 

my dear jane what is this i hear </s>
<s> going to the postoffice in the
rain </s>
<s> this must not be i assure you </s>
<s> you sad girl how could you do
such a thing </s>
<s> it is a sign i was not there to take care of you </s>
<s> 

jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  do not tell me </s>
<s>  you really are a very sad girl and do not know
how to take care of yourself </s>
<s> to the postoffice indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
did you ever hear the like </s>
<s>  you and i must positively exert our
authority </s>
<s> 

my advice said <abvr> weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do
feel tempted to give </s>
<s>  miss fairfax you must not run such risks </s>
<s> liable
as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly
careful especially at this time of year </s>
<s>  the spring i always think
requires more than common care </s>
<s>  better wait an hour or two or even
half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough
again </s>
<s>  now do not you feel that you had </s>
<s>  yes i am sure you are much too
reasonable </s>
<s>  you look as if you would not do such a thing again </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  we will not allow her to do such a thing again </s>
<s> and nodding
significantlythere must be some arrangement made there must indeed </s>
<s> 
i shall speak to <abvr> e </s>
<s>  the man who fetches our letters every morning
one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and
bring them to you </s>
<s>  that will obviate all difficulties you know </s>
<s>  and from
us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept
such an accommodation </s>
<s> 

you are extremely kind said jane </s>
<s>  but i cannot give up my early
walk </s>
<s>  i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk
somewhere and the postoffice is an object </s>
<s>  and upon my word i have
scarcely ever had a bad morning before </s>
<s> 

my dear jane say no more about it </s>
<s>  the thing is determined that is
laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing
without the concurrence of my lord and master </s>
<s>  you know <abvr> weston
you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves </s>
<s>  but i do flatter
myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out </s>
<s>  if i
meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as
settled </s>
<s> 

excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such
an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant </s>
<s>  if the errand
were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am
not here by my grandmamas </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear </s>
<s>  but so much as patty has to do </s>
<s> and it is a kindness to
employ our men </s>
<s> 

jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered </s>
<s>  but instead of
answering she began speaking again to <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> 

the postoffice is a wonderful establishment </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> the
regularity and despatch of it </s>
<s>  if one thinks of all that it has to do
and all that it does so well it is really astonishing </s>
<s> 

it is certainly very well regulated </s>
<s> 

so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears </s>
<s>  so seldom that
a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the
kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million i suppose
actually lost </s>
<s>  and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad
hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder </s>
<s> 

the clerks grow expert from habit </s>
<s> they must begin with some quickness
of sight and hand and exercise improves them </s>
<s>  if you want any farther
explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it </s>
<s>  that is
the key to a great deal of capacity </s>
<s>  the public pays and must be served
well </s>
<s> 

the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual
observations made </s>
<s> 

i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort
of handwriting often prevails in a family </s>
<s>  and where the same master
teaches it is natural enough </s>
<s>  but for that reason i should imagine
the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very
little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can
get </s>
<s>  isabella and emma i think do write very much alike </s>
<s>  i have not
always known their writing apart </s>
<s> 

yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness </s>
<s>  i know what
you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest </s>
<s> 

isabella and emma both write beautifully said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  and
always did </s>
<s>  and so does poor <abvr> westonwith half a sigh and half a
smile at her </s>
<s> 

i never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also at
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  but stopped on perceiving that <abvr> weston was attending
to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect now how am
i going to introduce him </s>
<s> am i unequal to speaking his name at once
before all these people </s>
<s>  is it necessary for me to use any roundabout
phrase </s>
<s> your yorkshire friendyour correspondent in yorkshire </s>
<s> that
would be the way i suppose if i were very bad </s>
<s> no i can pronounce
his name without the smallest distress </s>
<s>  i certainly get better and
better </s>
<s> now for it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was disengaged and emma began againmr </s>
<s>  frank churchill

<s> 

i do not admire it said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  it is too smallwants
strength </s>
<s>  it is like a womans writing </s>
<s> 

this was not submitted to by either lady </s>
<s>  they vindicated him against
the base aspersion </s>
<s>  no it by no means wanted strengthit was not a
large hand but very clear and certainly strong </s>
<s>  had not <abvr> weston any
letter about her to produce </s>
<s>  no she had heard from him very lately

<s> 

if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk i

remember <abvr> weston employing him to write for you one day </s>

he chose to say he was employed

well well i have that note </s>

mr </s>

dinner was on table </s>

<s>  elton before she could be spoken to was
ready </s>
<s>  and before <abvr> woodhouse had reached her with his request to be
allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying

must i go first </s>
<s>  i really am ashamed of always leading the way </s>
<s> 

janes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma </s>
<s> 
she had heard and seen it all </s>
<s>  and felt some curiosity to know whether
the wet walk of this morning had produced any </s>
<s>  she suspected that it
had </s>
<s>  that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full
expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been
in vain </s>
<s>  she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usuala
glow both of complexion and spirits </s>
<s> 

she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the
expense of the irish mails </s>
<s> it was at her tongues endbut she
abstained </s>
<s>  she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt
jane fairfaxs feelings </s>
<s>  and they followed the other ladies out of the
room arm in arm with an appearance of goodwill highly becoming to the
beauty and grace of each </s>

chapter xvii


when the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found it
hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties </s>
<s> with so
much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did <abvr> elton engross
jane fairfax and slight herself </s>

be almost always either talking together or silent together </s>

left them no choice </s>
<s>  if jane repressed her for a little time she
soon began again </s>
<s>  and though much that passed between them was in a
halfwhisper especially on <abvr> eltons side there was no avoiding
a knowledge of their principal subjects </s>
<s>  the postofficecatching
coldfetching lettersand friendship were long under discussion </s>

and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant
to janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to
suit her and professions of <abvr> eltons meditated activity </s>

<s>  dear <abvr> elton who can
have thought of it as i have done </s>

trouble </s>

but my dear child the time is drawing near </s>

inquiring directly </s>

excuse me maam but this is by no means my intention </s>

something that would do </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  aye that may suit
your humble ideas of yourself </s>
<s> i know what a modest creature you are </s>
<s> 
but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any
thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family
not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of
life </s>
<s> 

you are very obliging </s>
<s>  but as to all that i am very indifferent </s>
<s> 
it would be no object to me to be with the rich </s>

think would only be the greater </s>

a gentlemans family is all that i should condition for </s>

be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite
on my side </s>
<s>  with your superior talents you have a right to move in the

might do all that i am very sure </s>
<s>  but you sing as well as play </s>
<s> yes i
really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what
you chose </s>
<s> and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and
comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest </s>
<s> 

you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such

<s> 
however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted

obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing
nothing to be done till the summer </s>
<s>  for two or three months longer i

<s> 

and i am quite serious too i assure you replied <abvr> elton gaily
in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to
watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us </s>
<s> 

in this style she ran on </s>
<s>  never thoroughly stopped by any thing till <abvr>
woodhouse came into the room </s>
<s>  her vanity had then a change of object
and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane

gallantry in coming away before the other men </s>

he is </s>
<s> i assure you i like him excessively </s>
<s>  i admire all that quaint
oldfashioned politeness </s>
<s>  it is much more to my taste than modern ease </s>
<s> 
modern ease often disgusts me </s>
<s>  but this good old <abvr> woodhouse i wish
you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  i assure you i
began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous </s>
<s>  i fancy i
am rather a favourite </s>
<s>  he took notice of my gown </s>
<s>  how do you like
it </s>
<s> selinas choicehandsome i think but i do not know whether it
is not overtrimmed </s>
<s>  i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being
overtrimmedquite a horror of finery </s>
<s>  i must put on a few ornaments
now because it is expected of me </s>
<s>  a bride you know must appear like
a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity </s>
<s>  a simple style
of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery </s>
<s>  but i am quite in the
minority i believe </s>
<s>  few people seem to value simplicity of dressshow
and finery are every thing </s>
<s>  i have some notion of putting such a
trimming as this to my white and silver poplin </s>
<s>  do you think it will
look well </s>
<s> 

the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom when <abvr>
weston made his appearance among them </s>
<s>  he had returned to a late dinner
and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over </s>
<s>  he had been too much
expected by the best judges for surprizebut there was great joy </s>
<s>  <abvr>
woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry
to see him before </s>
<s>  john knightley only was in mute astonishment </s>
<s> that
a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day
of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile
to another mans house for the sake of being in mixed company till
bedtime of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise
of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply </s>
<s>  a man who had been
in motion since eight oclock in the morning and might now have been
still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had
been in more than one crowd and might have been alone </s>
<s> such a man to
quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the
evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world </s>
<s> could
he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there
would have been a motive </s>
<s>  but his coming would probably prolong rather
than break up the party </s>
<s>  john knightley looked at him with amazement
then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it
even of him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was
exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being
principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was
making himself agreeable among the rest </s>
<s>  and having satisfied the
inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all
her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread
abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family
communication which though principally addressed to <abvr> weston he
had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in
the room </s>
<s>  he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself </s>
<s>  he
had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it </s>
<s> 

read it read it said he it will give you pleasure </s>
<s>  only a few
lineswill not take you long </s>
<s>  read it to emma </s>
<s> 

the two ladies looked over it together </s>
<s>  and he sat smiling and talking
to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to
every body </s>
<s> 

well he is coming you see </s>
<s>  good news i think </s>
<s>  well what do you say
to it </s>
<s> i always told you he would be here again soon did not i </s>
<s> anne
my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me </s>
<s> in
town next week you seeat the latest i dare say </s>
<s>  for she is as
impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done </s>
<s>  most
likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday </s>
<s>  as to her illness all
nothing of course </s>
<s>  but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us
again so near as town </s>
<s>  they will stay a good while when they do come
and he will be half his time with us </s>
<s>  this is precisely what i wanted </s>
<s> 
well pretty good news is not it </s>
<s>  have you finished it </s>
<s>  has emma read
it all </s>
<s>  put it up put it up </s>
<s>  we will have a good talk about it some
other time but it will not do now </s>
<s>  i shall only just mention the
circumstance to the others in a common way </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion </s>
<s>  her looks
and words had nothing to restrain them </s>
<s>  she was happy she knew she was
happy and knew she ought to be happy </s>
<s>  her congratulations were warm and
open </s>
<s>  but emma could not speak so fluently </s>
<s>  she was a little occupied
in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her
agitation which she rather thought was considerable </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative
to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already </s>
<s> 

it was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he might
not have thought either <abvr> woodhouse or <abvr> knightley particularly
delighted </s>
<s>  they were the first entitled after <abvr> weston and emma to
be made happy </s>
<s> from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but
she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have
been too positive an interruption </s>
<s>  and finding himself close to <abvr>
elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject
with her </s>

chapter xviii


i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you
 said <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her
by such a hope smiled most graciously </s>
<s> 

you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he
continuedand know him to be my son though he does not bear my name </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance </s>
<s>  i am sure <abvr>
elton will lose no time in calling on him </s>
<s>  and we shall both have great
pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage </s>
<s> 

you are very obliging </s>
<s> frank will be extremely happy i am sure </s>
<s> 
he is to be in town next week if not sooner </s>
<s>  we have notice of it in a
letter today </s>
<s>  i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my
sons hand presumed to open itthough it was not directed to meit
was to <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she is his principal correspondent i assure you </s>
<s>  i
hardly ever get a letter </s>
<s> 

and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  <abvr>
westonlaughing affectedly i must protest against that </s>
<s> a most
dangerous precedent indeed </s>
<s> i beg you will not let your neighbours
follow your example </s>
<s> upon my word if this is what i am to expect we
married women must begin to exert ourselves </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston i could
not have believed it of you </s>
<s> 

aye we men are sad fellows </s>
<s>  you must take care of yourself <abvr>
elton </s>
<s> this letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry
merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to
town directly on <abvr> churchills accountshe has not been well the
whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for herso they are all to
move southward without loss of time </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> from yorkshire i think </s>
<s>  enscombe is in yorkshire </s>
<s> 

yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a
considerable journey </s>
<s> 

yes upon my word very considerable </s>
<s>  sixtyfive miles farther than
from maple grove to london </s>
<s>  but what is distance <abvr> weston to people
of large fortune </s>
<s> you would be amazed to hear how my brother <abvr>
suckling sometimes flies about </s>
<s>  you will hardly believe mebut twice
in one week he and <abvr> bragge went to london and back again with four
horses </s>
<s> 

the evil of the distance from enscombe said <abvr> weston is that
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together </s>
<s>  in franks last letter she complained he
said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
both his arm and his uncles </s>
<s>  this you know speaks a great degree of
weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to
sleep only two nights on the road </s>
<s> so frank writes word </s>
<s>  certainly
delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  you
must grant me that </s>
<s> 

no indeed i shall grant you nothing </s>
<s>  i always take the part of my
own sex </s>
<s>  i do indeed </s>
<s>  i give you noticeyou will find me a formidable
antagonist on that point </s>
<s>  i always stand up for womenand i assure you
if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you
would not wonder at <abvr> churchills making incredible exertions to
avoid it </s>
<s>  selina says it is quite horror to herand i believe i have
caught a little of her nicety </s>
<s>  she always travels with her own sheets </s>
<s> 
an excellent precaution </s>
<s>  does <abvr> churchill do the same </s>
<s> 

depend upon it <abvr> churchill does every thing that any other fine
lady ever did </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill will not be second to any lady in the land
for

mrs </s>
<s>  elton eagerly interposed with

oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston do not mistake me </s>
<s>  selina is no fine lady i assure
you </s>
<s>  do not run away with such an idea </s>
<s> 

is not she </s>
<s>  then she is no rule for <abvr> churchill who is as thorough
a fine lady as any body ever beheld </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly </s>
<s> 
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was
not a fine lady </s>
<s>  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of
it </s>
<s> and she was considering in what way she had best retract when <abvr>
weston went on </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspectbut
this is quite between ourselves </s>
<s>  she is very fond of frank and
therefore i would not speak ill of her </s>
<s>  besides she is out of health
now </s>
<s>  but that indeed by her own account she has always been </s>
<s>  i would
not say so to every body <abvr> elton but i have not much faith in <abvr>
churchills illness </s>
<s> 

if she is really ill why not go to bath <abvr> weston </s>
<s> to bath or to
clifton </s>
<s>  she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for
her </s>
<s>  the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe </s>
<s>  she has now
been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she
begins to want change </s>
<s>  it is a retired place </s>
<s>  a fine place but very
retired </s>
<s> 

ayelike maple grove i dare say </s>
<s>  nothing can stand more retired from
the road than maple grove </s>
<s>  such an immense plantation all round it </s>
<s>  you
seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement </s>
<s> and
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy
that sort of seclusion </s>
<s>  or perhaps she may not have resources enough in
herself to be qualified for a country life </s>
<s>  i always say a woman cannot
have too many resourcesand i feel very thankful that i have so many
myself as to be quite independent of society </s>
<s> 

frank was here in february for a fortnight </s>
<s> 

so i remember to have heard </s>
<s>  he will find an addition to the society
of highbury when he comes again </s>
<s>  that is if i may presume to call
myself an addition </s>
<s>  but perhaps he may never have heard of there being
such a creature in the world </s>
<s> 

this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and <abvr>
weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed

my dear madam </s>
<s>  nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible </s>
<s> 
not heard of you </s>
<s> i believe <abvr> westons letters lately have been full
of very little else than <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

he had done his duty and could return to his son </s>
<s> 

when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we
might see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome </s>
<s>  it has
been completely unexpected </s>
<s>  that is i always had a strong persuasion
he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn
upbut nobody believed me </s>
<s>  he and <abvr> weston were both dreadfully
desponding </s>
<s>  ˜how could he contrive to come </s>
<s>  and how could it be supposed
that his uncle and aunt would spare him again </s>
<s>  and so forthi always
felt that something would happen in our favour </s>
<s>  and so it has you see </s>
<s> 
i have observed <abvr> elton in the course of my life that if things
are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next </s>
<s> 

very true <abvr> weston perfectly true </s>
<s>  it is just what i used to say to
a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because
things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity
which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that
he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymens saffron robe
would be put on for us </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the pains i have been at to dispel those
gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views </s>
<s>  the carriagewe had
disappointments about the carriage </s>
<s> one morning i remember he came to
me quite in despair </s>
<s> 

she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and <abvr> weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on </s>
<s> 

you were mentioning may </s>
<s>  may is the very month which <abvr> churchill
is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than
enscombein short to spend in london </s>
<s>  so that we have the agreeable
prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole springprecisely the
season of the year which one should have chosen for it </s>
<s>  days almost at
the longest </s>
<s>  weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and
never too hot for exercise </s>
<s>  when he was here before we made the best
of it </s>
<s>  but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather </s>
<s> 
there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we
intended </s>
<s>  now will be the time </s>
<s>  this will be complete enjoyment </s>
<s>  and i
do not know <abvr> elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the
sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in today or
tomorrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than
having him actually in the house </s>
<s>  i think it is so </s>
<s>  i think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight </s>
<s>  i hope you will be
pleased with my son </s>
<s>  but you must not expect a prodigy </s>
<s>  he is generally
thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy </s>
<s>  <abvr> westons
partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most
gratifying to me </s>
<s>  she thinks nobody equal to him </s>
<s> 

and i assure you <abvr> weston i have very little doubt that my opinion
will be decidedly in his favour </s>
<s>  i have heard so much in praise of <abvr>
frank churchill </s>
<s> at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one
of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly
guided by others </s>
<s>  i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall
judge of him </s>
<s> i am no flatterer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston was musing </s>
<s> 

i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor <abvr>
churchill </s>
<s>  if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice </s>
<s>  but
there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to
speak of her with the forbearance i could wish </s>
<s>  you cannot be ignorant
mrs </s>
<s>  elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have
met with </s>
<s>  and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid
to her </s>
<s>  she was the instigator </s>
<s>  franks mother would never have been
slighted as she was but for her </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill has pride </s>
<s>  but his pride
is nothing to his wifes </s>
<s>  his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort
of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless
and tiresome </s>
<s>  but her pride is arrogance and insolence </s>
<s>  and what
inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood </s>
<s> 
she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman </s>
<s> 
but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld
them all in high and mighty claims </s>
<s>  but in herself i assure you she is
an upstart </s>
<s> 

only think </s>
<s>  well that must be infinitely provoking </s>
<s>  i have quite
a horror of upstarts </s>
<s>  maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to
people of that sort </s>
<s>  for there is a family in that neighbourhood who
are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give
themselves </s>
<s>  your description of <abvr> churchill made me think of them
directly </s>
<s>  people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and
encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs
and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families </s>
<s> 
a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west
hall </s>
<s>  and how they got their fortune nobody knows </s>
<s>  they came from
birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
one has not great hopes from birmingham </s>
<s>  i always say there is something
direful in the sound </s>
<s>  but nothing more is positively known of the
tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected </s>
<s>  and
yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to
my brother <abvr> suckling who happens to be one of their nearest
neighbours </s>
<s>  it is infinitely too bad </s>
<s>  <abvr> suckling who has been eleven
years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before himi
believe at leasti am almost sure that old <abvr> suckling had completed
the purchase before his death </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted </s>
<s>  tea was carrying round and <abvr> weston having
said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away </s>
<s> 

after tea <abvr> and <abvr> weston and <abvr> elton sat down with <abvr>
woodhouse to cards </s>
<s>  the remaining five were left to their own powers
and emma doubted their getting on very well </s>
<s>  for <abvr> knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was wanting notice which
nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits
which would have made her prefer being silent </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley proved more talkative than his brother </s>
<s>  he was to
leave them early the next day </s>
<s>  and he soon began with

well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the
boys </s>
<s>  but you have your sisters letter and every thing is down at full
length there we may be sure </s>
<s>  my charge would be much more concise than
hers and probably not much in the same spirit </s>
<s>  all that i have to
recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic
them </s>
<s> 

i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all
in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella </s>
<s>  and
happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic </s>
<s> 

and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again </s>
<s> 

that is very likely </s>
<s>  you think so do not you </s>
<s> 

i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your fatheror even
may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to
increase as much as they have done lately </s>
<s> 

increase </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>  you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made a
great difference in your way of life </s>
<s> 

difference </s>
<s>  no indeed i am not </s>
<s> 

there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than
you used to be </s>
<s>  witness this very time </s>
<s>  here am i come down for only
one day and you are engaged with a dinnerparty </s>
<s> when did it happen
before or any thing like it </s>
<s>  your neighbourhood is increasing and you
mix more with it </s>
<s>  a little while ago every letter to isabella brought
an account of fresh gaieties </s>
<s>  dinners at <abvr> coles or balls at the
crown </s>
<s>  the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your
goingson is very great </s>
<s> 

yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all </s>
<s> 

very welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less
influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that
henry and john may be sometimes in the way </s>
<s>  and if they are i only beg
you to send them home </s>
<s> 

no cried <abvr> knightley that need not be the consequence </s>
<s>  let them
be sent to donwell </s>
<s>  i shall certainly be at leisure </s>
<s> 

upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me </s>
<s>  i should like to know how
many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of
the party </s>
<s>  and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to
attend to the little boys </s>
<s>  these amazing engagements of minewhat have
they been </s>
<s>  dining once with the colesand having a ball talked of
which never took place </s>
<s>  i can understand younodding at <abvr> john
knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at
once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed </s>
<s>  but you turning to
mr </s>
<s>  knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from
hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i
cannot imagine </s>
<s>  and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt
emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better
with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she
is absent oneand who when he is at home is either reading to himself
or settling his accounts </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley seemed to be trying not to smile </s>
<s>  and succeeded without
difficulty upon <abvr> eltons beginning to talk to him </s>

volume iii



chapter i


a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill </s>
<s>  she
was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all
apprehensive or embarrassed </s>
<s>  it was for him </s>
<s>  her own attachment had
really subsided into a mere nothing </s>
<s>  it was not worth thinking of </s>
<s> but
if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the
two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had
taken away it would be very distressing </s>
<s>  if a separation of two
months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before
her </s>
<s> caution for him and for herself would be necessary </s>
<s>  she did
not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be
incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his </s>
<s> 

she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration </s>
<s> 
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present
acquaintance </s>
<s>  and yet she could not help rather anticipating something
decisive </s>
<s>  she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a
crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil
state </s>
<s> 

it was not very long though rather longer than <abvr> weston had foreseen
before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills
feelings </s>
<s>  the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been
imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards </s>
<s>  he rode down
for a couple of hours </s>
<s>  he could not yet do more </s>
<s>  but as he came from
randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick
observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she
must act </s>
<s>  they met with the utmost friendliness </s>
<s>  there could be no doubt
of his great pleasure in seeing her </s>
<s>  but she had an almost instant doubt
of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness
in the same degree </s>
<s>  she watched him well </s>
<s>  it was a clear thing he was
less in love than he had been </s>
<s>  absence with the conviction probably
of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable
effect </s>
<s> 

he was in high spirits </s>
<s>  as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed
delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories </s>
<s>  and he
was not without agitation </s>
<s>  it was not in his calmness that she read
his comparative difference </s>
<s>  he was not calm </s>
<s>  his spirits were evidently
fluttered </s>
<s>  there was restlessness about him </s>
<s>  lively as he was it seemed
a liveliness that did not satisfy himself </s>
<s>  but what decided her belief
on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying
away to make other calls in highbury </s>
<s>  he had seen a group of old
acquaintance in the street as he passedhe had not stopped he would
not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would
be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer
at hartfield he must hurry off </s>
<s>  she had no doubt as to his being less
in lovebut neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed
like a perfect cure </s>
<s>  and she was rather inclined to think it implied a
dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting
himself with her long </s>
<s> 

this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days </s>
<s> 
he was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented </s>
<s>  his
aunt could not bear to have him leave her </s>
<s>  such was his own account at
randalls </s>
<s>  if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was
to be inferred that <abvr> churchills removal to london had been of no
service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder </s>
<s>  that she was
really ill was very certain </s>
<s>  he had declared himself convinced of it at
randalls </s>
<s>  though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked
back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a
year ago </s>
<s>  he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care
and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many
years of existence before her </s>
<s>  but he could not be prevailed on by all
his fathers doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary
or that she was as strong as ever </s>
<s> 

it soon appeared that london was not the place for her </s>
<s>  she could
not endure its noise </s>
<s>  her nerves were under continual irritation and
suffering </s>
<s>  and by the ten days end her nephews letter to randalls
communicated a change of plan </s>
<s>  they were going to remove immediately to
richmond </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of
an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place </s>
<s>  a
readyfurnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit
expected from the change </s>
<s> 

emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months
before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friendsfor the
house was taken for may and june </s>
<s>  she was told that now he wrote with
the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he
could even wish </s>
<s> 

emma saw how <abvr> weston understood these joyous prospects </s>
<s>  he was
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered </s>
<s>  she
hoped it was not so </s>
<s>  two months must bring it to the proof </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  westons own happiness was indisputable </s>
<s>  he was quite delighted </s>
<s> 
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for </s>
<s>  now it would be
really having frank in their neighbourhood </s>
<s>  what were nine miles to
a young man </s>
<s> an hours ride </s>
<s>  he would be always coming over </s>
<s>  the
difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make
the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never </s>
<s>  sixteen
milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen to manchesterstreetwas
a serious obstacle </s>
<s>  were he ever able to get away the day would be
spent in coming and returning </s>
<s>  there was no comfort in having him in
london </s>
<s>  he might as well be at enscombe </s>
<s>  but richmond was the very
distance for easy intercourse </s>
<s>  better than nearer </s>
<s> 

one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this
removalthe ball at the crown </s>
<s>  it had not been forgotten before
but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day </s>
<s>  now
however it was absolutely to be </s>
<s>  every preparation was resumed and
very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from
frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and
that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour hours at
any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  westons ball was to be a real thing </s>
<s>  a very few tomorrows stood
between the young people of highbury and happiness </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was resigned </s>
<s>  the time of year lightened the evil to him </s>
<s> 
may was better for every thing than february </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates was engaged to
spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely
hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any
thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone </s>
<s> 



chapter ii


no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball </s>
<s>  the day approached
the day arrived </s>
<s>  and after a morning of some anxious watching frank
churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before
dinner and every thing was safe </s>
<s> 

no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma </s>
<s>  the room
at the crown was to witness it </s>
<s> but it would be better than a
common meeting in a crowd </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had been so very earnest in his
entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves
for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of
the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him
and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young mans company </s>
<s> 
she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the
randalls party just sufficiently before them </s>
<s> 

frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch </s>
<s>  and though he did not
say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening </s>
<s> 
they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should
be </s>
<s>  and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another
carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great
surprize </s>
<s>  so unreasonably early </s>
<s>  she was going to exclaim </s>
<s>  but she
presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming
like herself by particular desire to help <abvr> westons judgment </s>
<s>  and
they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins
who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing
earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company
might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory
inspection </s>
<s> 

emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which <abvr> weston
depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man
who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first
distinction in the scale of vanity </s>
<s>  she liked his open manners but
a little less of openheartedness would have made him a higher
character </s>
<s> general benevolence but not general friendship made a
man what he ought to be </s>
<s> she could fancy such a man </s>
<s>  the whole party
walked about and looked and praised again </s>
<s>  and then having nothing
else to do formed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe
in their various modes till other subjects were started that though
may a fire in the evening was still very pleasant </s>
<s> 

emma found that it was not <abvr> westons fault that the number of privy
councillors was not yet larger </s>
<s>  they had stopped at <abvr> batess door
to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be
brought by the eltons </s>
<s> 

frank was standing by her but not steadily </s>
<s>  there was a restlessness
which shewed a mind not at ease </s>
<s>  he was looking about he was going to
the door he was watching for the sound of other carriagesimpatient
to begin or afraid of being always near her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton was spoken of </s>
<s>  i think she must be here soon said he </s>
<s>  i
have a great curiosity to see <abvr> elton i have heard so much of her </s>
<s> 
it cannot be long i think before she comes </s>
<s> 

a carriage was heard </s>
<s>  he was on the move immediately </s>
<s>  but coming back
said

i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her </s>
<s>  i have never seen
either <abvr> or <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  i have no business to put myself forward </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton appeared </s>
<s>  and all the smiles and the proprieties
passed </s>
<s> 

but miss bates and miss fairfax </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston looking about </s>
<s>  we
thought you were to bring them </s>
<s> 

the mistake had been slight </s>
<s>  the carriage was sent for them now </s>
<s>  emma
longed to know what franks first opinion of <abvr> elton might be </s>
<s>  how
he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of
graciousness </s>
<s>  he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion
by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes the carriage returned </s>
<s> somebody talked of rain </s>
<s> i
will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father </s>
<s> 
miss bates must not be forgotten </s>
<s>  and away he went </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was
following </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion
of his son </s>
<s>  and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself
though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing </s>
<s> 

a very fine young man indeed <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  you know i candidly told you
i should form my own opinion </s>
<s>  and i am happy to say that i am extremely
pleased with him </s>
<s> you may believe me </s>
<s>  i never compliment </s>
<s>  i think him
a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and
approveso truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism </s>
<s> 
you must know i have a vast dislike to puppiesquite a horror of them </s>
<s> 
they were never tolerated at maple grove </s>
<s>  neither <abvr> suckling nor
me had ever any patience with them </s>
<s>  and we used sometimes to say very
cutting things </s>
<s>  selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them
much better </s>
<s> 

while she talked of his son <abvr> westons attention was chained </s>
<s>  but
when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies
just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton turned to <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i have no doubt of its being our
carriage with miss bates and jane </s>
<s>  our coachman and horses are so
extremely expeditious </s>
<s> i believe we drive faster than any body </s>
<s> what
a pleasure it is to send ones carriage for a friend </s>
<s> i understand you
were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary </s>
<s> 
you may be very sure i shall always take care of them </s>
<s> 

miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into
the room </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton seemed to think it as much her duty as <abvr>
westons to receive them </s>
<s>  her gestures and movements might be understood
by any one who looked on like emma </s>
<s>  but her words every bodys words
were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in
talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her
being admitted into the circle at the fire </s>
<s>  as the door opened she was
heard

so very obliging of you </s>
<s> no rain at all </s>
<s>  nothing to signify </s>
<s>  i do not
care for myself </s>
<s>  quite thick shoes </s>

<s> 

frank churchill returned to his station by emma </s>
<s>  and as soon as miss
bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse
of <abvr> elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind
her </s>
<s> he was thoughtful </s>
<s>  whether he were overhearing too she could not
determine </s>
<s>  after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look
compliments very quietly and properly taken <abvr> elton was evidently
wanting to be complimented herselfand it was how do you like
my gown </s>
<s> how do you like my trimming </s>
<s> how has wright done my
hair </s>
<s> with many other relative questions all answered with patient
politeness </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton then said nobody can think less of dress in
general than i dobut upon such an occasion as this when every bodys
eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westonswho i have
no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish
to be inferior to others </s>
<s>  and i see very few pearls in the room except
mine </s>
<s> so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand </s>
<s> we shall
see if our styles suit </s>
<s> a fine young man certainly is frank churchill </s>
<s> 
i like him very well </s>
<s> 

at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not
but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear
more </s>
<s> and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till
another suspension brought <abvr> eltons tones again distinctly
forward </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming

oh </s>
<s>  you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion </s>
<s> i was
this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for
tidings of us </s>
<s> 

jane </s>
<s> repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and
displeasure </s>
<s> that is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i
suppose </s>
<s> 

how do you like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  said emma in a whisper </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s> 

you are ungrateful </s>
<s> 

ungrateful </s>
<s> what do you mean </s>
<s>  then changing from a frown to a
smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you mean </s>
<s> where
is my father </s>
<s> when are we to begin dancing </s>
<s> 

emma could hardly understand him </s>
<s>  he seemed in an odd humour </s>
<s>  he walked
off to find his father but was quickly back again with both <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be
laid before emma </s>
<s>  it had just occurred to <abvr> weston that <abvr> elton
must be asked to begin the ball </s>
<s>  that she would expect it </s>
<s>  which
interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction </s>
<s> emma
heard the sad truth with fortitude </s>
<s> 

and what are we to do for a proper partner for her </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
she will think frank ought to ask her </s>
<s> 

frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise </s>
<s>  and
boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect
approbation ofand it then appeared that <abvr> weston was wanting him
to dance with <abvr> elton himself and that their business was to help to
persuade him into it which was done pretty soon </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  weston and <abvr>
elton led the way <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed </s>
<s> 
emma must submit to stand second to <abvr> elton though she had always
considered the ball as peculiarly for her </s>
<s>  it was almost enough to make
her think of marrying </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this
time in vanity completely gratified </s>
<s>  for though she had intended to
begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
might be his sons superior </s>
<s> in spite of this little rub however
emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length
of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours
of unusual festivity before her </s>
<s> she was more disturbed by <abvr>
knightleys not dancing than by any thing else </s>
<s> there he was among
the standersby where he ought not to be </s>
<s>  he ought to be dancingnot
classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whistplayers who
were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were
made upso young as he looked </s>
<s> he could not have appeared to greater
advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself </s>
<s>  his tall
firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of
the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes </s>
<s> 
and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of
young men who could be compared with him </s>
<s> he moved a few steps nearer
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner
with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the
trouble </s>
<s> whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile </s>
<s>  but
in general he was looking grave </s>
<s>  she wished he could love a ballroom
better and could like frank churchill better </s>
<s> he seemed often
observing her </s>
<s>  she must not flatter herself that he thought of her
dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel
afraid </s>
<s>  there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner </s>
<s> 
they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers </s>
<s>  that frank
churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable </s>
<s> 

the ball proceeded pleasantly </s>
<s>  the anxious cares the incessant
attentions of <abvr> weston were not thrown away </s>
<s>  every body seemed
happy </s>
<s>  and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom
bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in
the very beginning of the existence of this </s>
<s>  of very important very
recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually
are </s>
<s>  there was one however which emma thought something of </s>
<s> the two
last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner </s>
<s> the
only young lady sitting down </s>
<s> and so equal had been hitherto the
number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the
wonder </s>
<s> but emmas wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing <abvr> elton
sauntering about </s>
<s>  he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible
to be avoided </s>
<s>  she was sure he would notand she was expecting him
every moment to escape into the cardroom </s>
<s> 

escape however was not his plan </s>
<s>  he came to the part of the room where
the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about in front
of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining
it </s>
<s>  he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or
speaking to those who were close to her </s>
<s> emma saw it </s>
<s>  she was not yet
dancing </s>
<s>  she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore
leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw
it all </s>
<s>  when she was halfway up the set the whole group were exactly
behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which
just then took place between him and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  and she perceived that
his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only
listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances </s>
<s> the
kindhearted gentle <abvr> weston had left her seat to join him and say
do not you dance <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  to which his prompt reply was most
readily <abvr> weston if you will dance with me </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noi would get you a better partner than myself </s>
<s>  i am no
dancer </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great
pleasure i am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old
married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very
great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like <abvr>
gilbert </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady
disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith </s>
<s>  miss
smith </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i had not observed </s>
<s> you are extremely obligingand if i
were not an old married man </s>
<s> but my dancing days are over <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
you will excuse me </s>
<s>  any thing else i should be most happy to do at your
commandbut my dancing days are over </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston said no more </s>
<s>  and emma could imagine with what surprize and
mortification she must be returning to her seat </s>
<s>  this was <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the
amiable obliging gentle <abvr> elton </s>
<s> she looked round for a moment </s>
<s>  he
had joined <abvr> knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself
for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him
and his wife </s>
<s> 

she would not look again </s>
<s>  her heart was in a glow and she feared her
face might be as hot </s>
<s> 

in another moment a happier sight caught her </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley leading
harriet to the set </s>
<s> never had she been more surprized seldom more
delighted than at that instant </s>
<s>  she was all pleasure and gratitude
both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him </s>
<s>  and though
too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could
catch his eye again </s>
<s> 

his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good </s>
<s> 
and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for
the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment
and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features
announced </s>
<s>  it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever
flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted very
foolish </s>
<s>  she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though
growing very like her </s>
<s> she spoke some of her feelings by observing
audibly to her partner

knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith </s>
<s> very goodnatured

emma had no opportunity of speaking to <abvr> knightley till after supper </s>

reprobation of <abvr> eltons conduct </s>

<s> 
and <abvr> eltons looks also received the due share of censure </s>

they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he </s>

that they are your enemies </s>
<s> 

he looked with smiling penetration </s>

be </s>

<s>  but confess emma
that you did want him to marry harriet </s>

i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me </s>

he shook his head </s>

only said

was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet </s>

chapter iii


this little explanation with <abvr> knightley gave emma considerable
pleasure </s>
<s>  it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which
she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy </s>
<s> she was extremely
glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the
eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much
alike </s>
<s>  and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was
peculiarly gratifying </s>
<s>  the impertinence of the eltons which for a few
minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions </s>
<s>  and she looked forward
to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuation </s>
<s> from
harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the
ballroom she had strong hopes </s>
<s>  it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly
opened and she were enabled to see that <abvr> elton was not the superior
creature she had believed him </s>
<s>  the fever was over and emma could
harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious
courtesy </s>
<s>  she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for
supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther
requisite </s>
<s> harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and
mr </s>
<s>  knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer
must be before her </s>
<s> 

she was not to see frank churchill this morning </s>
<s>  he had told her that he
could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was
to be at home by the middle of the day </s>
<s>  she did not regret it </s>
<s> 

having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all
to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa
when the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered whom she
had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill with harriet
leaning on his armactually harriet </s>
<s> a moment sufficed to convince
her that something extraordinary had happened </s>
<s>  harriet looked white
and frightened and he was trying to cheer her </s>
<s> the iron gates and the
frontdoor were not twenty yards asunder </s>
<s> they were all three soon in
the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away </s>
<s> 

a young lady who faints must be recovered </s>
<s>  questions must be answered
and surprizes be explained </s>
<s>  such events are very interesting but the
suspense of them cannot last long </s>
<s>  a few minutes made emma acquainted
with the whole </s>
<s> 

miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at <abvr>
goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together and
taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough
for safety had led them into alarm </s>
<s> about half a mile beyond highbury
making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became
for a considerable stretch very retired </s>
<s>  and when the young ladies
had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small
distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a
party of gipsies </s>
<s>  a child on the watch came towards them to beg </s>
<s>  and
miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling
on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at
the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury </s>
<s> 
but poor harriet could not follow </s>
<s>  she had suffered very much from cramp
after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such
a return of it as made her absolutely powerlessand in this state and
exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain </s>
<s> 

how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more
courageous must be doubtful </s>
<s>  but such an invitation for attack could
not be resisted </s>
<s>  and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children
headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent
in look though not absolutely in word </s>
<s> more and more frightened she
immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a
shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill </s>
<s> she
was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving awaybut her
terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather
surrounded by the whole gang demanding more </s>
<s> 

in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and
conditioning they loud and insolent </s>
<s>  by a most fortunate chance his
leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance
at this critical moment </s>
<s>  the pleasantness of the morning had induced
him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road
a mile or two beyond highburyand happening to have borrowed a pair
of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to
restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a
few minutes </s>
<s>  he was therefore later than he had intended </s>
<s>  and being
on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them </s>
<s>  the
terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then
their own portion </s>
<s>  he had left them completely frightened </s>
<s>  and harriet
eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength
enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome </s>
<s> 
it was his idea to bring her to hartfield </s>
<s>  he had thought of no other
place </s>
<s> 

this was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and of
harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech </s>
<s> he dared
not stay longer than to see her well </s>
<s>  these several delays left him
not another minute to lose </s>
<s>  and emma engaging to give assurance of her
safety to <abvr> goddard and notice of there being such a set of people
in the neighbourhood to <abvr> knightley he set off with all the grateful
blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself </s>
<s> 

such an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young woman
thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain
ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain </s>
<s>  so emma thought at
least </s>
<s>  could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician
have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and
heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been
at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other </s>
<s> how much
more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and
foresight </s>
<s> especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her
mind had already made </s>
<s> 

it was a very extraordinary thing </s>
<s>  nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory </s>
<s>  no
rencontre no alarm of the kind </s>
<s> and now it had happened to the very
person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing
to pass by to rescue her </s>
<s> it certainly was very extraordinary </s>
<s> and
knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this
period it struck her the more </s>
<s>  he was wishing to get the better of his
attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 
it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting
consequences </s>
<s>  it was not possible that the occurrence should not be
strongly recommending each to the other </s>
<s> 

in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while
harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror
her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a
sensibility amused and delighted </s>
<s>  and just at last after harriets
own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the
abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms </s>
<s>  every thing was
to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted </s>
<s> 
she would not stir a step nor drop a hint </s>
<s>  no she had had enough of
interference </s>
<s>  there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme </s>
<s> 
it was no more than a wish </s>
<s>  beyond it she would on no account proceed </s>
<s> 

emmas first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of
what had passedaware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion </s>
<s>  but
she soon felt that concealment must be impossible </s>
<s>  within half an hour
it was known all over highbury </s>
<s>  it was the very event to engage those
who talk most the young and the low </s>
<s>  and all the youth and servants in
the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news </s>
<s>  the last nights
ball seemed lost in the gipsies </s>
<s>  poor <abvr> woodhouse trembled as he sat
and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their
promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again </s>
<s>  it was some comfort
to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his
neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss
smith were coming in during the rest of the day </s>
<s>  and he had
the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very
indifferentwhich though not exactly true for she was perfectly well
and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with </s>
<s>  she had
an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man
for she hardly knew what indisposition was </s>
<s>  and if he did not invent
illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message </s>
<s> 

the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice </s>
<s>  they took
themselves off in a hurry </s>
<s>  the young ladies of highbury might have
walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history
dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her
nephews </s>
<s> in her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and
john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the
gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the
slightest particular from the original recital </s>
<s> 



chapter iv


a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one
morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down
and hesitating thus began </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i should
like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then you know it
will be over </s>
<s> 

emma was a good deal surprized </s>
<s>  but begged her to speak </s>
<s>  there was a
seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her quite as much as her
words for something more than ordinary </s>
<s> 

it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have
no reserves with you on this subject </s>
<s>  as i am happily quite an altered
creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have
the satisfaction of knowing it </s>
<s>  i do not want to say more than is
necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and
i dare say you understand me </s>
<s> 

yes said emma i hope i do </s>
<s> 

how i could so long a time be fancying myself </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  cried harriet
warmly </s>
<s>  it seems like madness </s>
<s>  i can see nothing at all extraordinary
in him now </s>
<s> i do not care whether i meet him or notexcept that of the
two i had rather not see himand indeed i would go any distance round
to avoid himbut i do not envy his wife in the least </s>
<s>  i neither admire
her nor envy her as i have done </s>
<s>  she is very charming i dare say and
all that but i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall
never forget her look the other night </s>
<s> however i assure you miss
woodhouse i wish her no evil </s>
<s> no let them be ever so happy together
it will not give me another moments pang </s>
<s>  and to convince you that i
have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i ought to
have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kepti know that
very well blushing as she spoke </s>
<s> however now i will destroy it
alland it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you
may see how rational i am grown </s>
<s>  cannot you guess what this parcel
holds </s>
<s>  said she with a conscious look </s>
<s> 

not the least in the world </s>
<s> did he ever give you any thing </s>
<s> 

noi cannot call them gifts </s>
<s>  but they are things that i have valued
very much </s>
<s> 

she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most
precious treasures on the top </s>
<s>  her curiosity was greatly excited </s>
<s> 
harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience </s>
<s>  within
abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box
which harriet opened </s>
<s>  it was well lined with the softest cotton </s>
<s>  but
excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister </s>
<s> 

now said harriet you must recollect </s>
<s> 

no indeed i do not </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  i should not have thought it possible you could forget what
passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very last
times we ever met in it </s>
<s> it was but a very few days before i had my
sore throatjust before <abvr> and <abvr> john knightley camei think the
very evening </s>
<s> do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new
penknife and your recommending courtplaister </s>
<s> but as you had none
about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him </s>
<s>  and so i took
mine out and cut him a piece </s>
<s>  but it was a great deal too large and he
cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he
gave it back to me </s>
<s>  and so then in my nonsense i could not help making
a treasure of itso i put it by never to be used and looked at it now
and then as a great treat </s>
<s> 

my dearest harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma putting her hand before her face
and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear </s>
<s> 
remember it </s>
<s>  aye i remember it all now </s>
<s>  all except your saving this
relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the
finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none
about me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  my sins my sins </s>
<s> and i had plenty all the while in my
pocket </s>
<s> one of my senseless tricks </s>
<s> i deserve to be under a continual
blush all the rest of my life </s>
<s> wellsitting down againgo onwhat
else </s>
<s> 

and had you really some at hand yourself </s>
<s>  i am sure i never suspected
it you did it so naturally </s>
<s> 

and so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake </s>
<s> 
 said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement </s>
<s>  and secretly she added to herself lord
bless me </s>
<s>  when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a
piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about </s>
<s>  i
never was equal to this </s>
<s> 

here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something
still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because
this is what did really once belong to him which the courtplaister
never did </s>
<s> 

emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure </s>
<s>  it was the end of an
old pencilthe part without any lead </s>
<s> 

this was really his said harriet </s>
<s> do not you remember one
morning </s>
<s> no i dare say you do not </s>
<s>  but one morningi forget exactly
the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that
evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook </s>
<s>  it was
about sprucebeer </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had been telling him something about
brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down </s>
<s>  but when he took out
his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and
it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the
table as good for nothing </s>
<s>  but i kept my eye on it </s>
<s>  and as soon as i
dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment </s>
<s> 

i do remember it cried emma </s>
<s>  i perfectly remember it </s>
<s> talking
about sprucebeer </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yesmr </s>
<s>  knightley and i both saying we
liked it and <abvr> eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too </s>
<s>  i
perfectly remember it </s>
<s> stop </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley was standing just here was
not he </s>
<s>  i have an idea he was standing just here </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i do not know </s>
<s>  i cannot recollect </s>
<s> it is very odd but i cannot
recollect </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton was sitting here i remember much about where i
am now </s>
<s> 

well go on </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s>  i have nothing more to shew you or to sayexcept that
i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see
me do it </s>
<s> 

my poor dear harriet </s>
<s>  and have you actually found happiness in
treasuring up these things </s>
<s> 

yes simpleton as i was </s>
<s> but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i
could forget as easily as i can burn them </s>
<s>  it was very wrong of me you
know to keep any remembrances after he was married </s>
<s>  i knew it wasbut
had not resolution enough to part with them </s>
<s> 

but harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaister </s>
<s> i have not
a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister might be
useful </s>
<s> 

i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet </s>
<s>  it has a disagreeable
look to me </s>
<s>  i must get rid of every thing </s>
<s> there it goes and there is
an end thank heaven </s>
<s>  of <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

and when thought emma will there be a beginning of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s> 

she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already
made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no
fortune might be proved to have made harriets </s>
<s> about a fortnight
after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite
undesignedly </s>
<s>  emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the
information she received more valuable </s>
<s>  she merely said in the course
of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise
you to do so and soand thought no more of it till after a minutes
silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never
marry </s>
<s> 

emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was </s>
<s>  and after a
moments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied

never marry </s>
<s> this is a new resolution </s>
<s> 

it is one that i shall never change however </s>
<s> 

after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed fromi hope
it is not in compliment to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton indeed </s>
<s>  cried harriet indignantly </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noand emma could
just catch the words so superior to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

she then took a longer time for consideration </s>
<s>  should she proceed no
farther </s>
<s> should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing </s>
<s> perhaps
harriet might think her cold or angry if she did </s>
<s>  or perhaps if she were
totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too
much </s>
<s>  and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such
an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly
resolved </s>
<s> she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at
once all that she meant to say and know </s>
<s>  plain dealing was always
best </s>
<s>  she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any
application of the sort </s>
<s>  and it would be safer for both to have the
judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed </s>
<s> she was decided
and thus spoke

harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning </s>
<s>  your
resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from
an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your
superior in situation to think of you </s>
<s>  is not it so </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose
indeed i am not so mad </s>
<s> but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a
distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of
the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so
proper in me especially </s>
<s> 

i am not at all surprized at you harriet </s>
<s>  the service he rendered you
was enough to warm your heart </s>
<s> 

service </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  it was such an inexpressible obligation </s>
<s> the very
recollection of it and all that i felt at the timewhen i saw him
cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before </s>
<s>  such a change </s>
<s>  in
one moment such a change </s>
<s>  from perfect misery to perfect happiness </s>
<s> 

it is very natural </s>
<s>  it is natural and it is honourable </s>
<s> yes
honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully </s>
<s> but that
it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise </s>
<s>  i do not
advise you to give way to it harriet </s>
<s>  i do not by any means engage
for its being returned </s>
<s>  consider what you are about </s>
<s>  perhaps it will be
wisest in you to check your feelings while you can </s>
<s>  at any rate do not
let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you </s>
<s>  be
observant of him </s>
<s>  let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations </s>
<s>  i
give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on
the subject </s>
<s>  i am determined against all interference </s>
<s>  henceforward i
know nothing of the matter </s>
<s>  let no name ever pass our lips </s>
<s>  we were very
wrong before </s>
<s>  we will be cautious now </s>
<s> he is your superior no doubt
and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature </s>
<s>  but
yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been
matches of greater disparity </s>
<s>  but take care of yourself </s>
<s>  i would not
have you too sanguine </s>
<s>  though however it may end be assured your
raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall
always know how to value </s>
<s> 

harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude </s>
<s>  emma was
very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend </s>
<s> 
its tendency would be to raise and refine her mindand it must be
saving her from the danger of degradation </s>

chapter v


in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon

eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use

grandmothers </s>
<s>  and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again
delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely

mr </s>
<s>  knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly
taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike
him more </s>

declared it </s>

to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet <abvr> knightley
began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax </s>
<s>  he
could not understand it </s>
<s>  but there were symptoms of intelligence between
themhe thought so at leastsymptoms of admiration on his side which
having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely
void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emmas errors
of imagination </s>
<s>  she was not present when the suspicion first arose </s>
<s> 
he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons </s>
<s>  and he
had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from
the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place </s>
<s>  when he was
again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen </s>
<s> 
nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and
his fire at twilight

myself creating what i saw

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private
liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane </s>
<s> 

he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend
his evening at hartfield </s>
<s>  emma and harriet were going to walk </s>
<s>  he joined
them </s>
<s>  and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like
themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the
weather threatened rain </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> weston and their son miss bates
and her niece who had accidentally met </s>
<s>  they all united </s>
<s>  and on
reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of
visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in
and drink tea with him </s>
<s>  the randalls party agreed to it immediately </s>
<s>  and
after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened
to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouses most
obliging invitation </s>
<s> 

as they were turning into the grounds <abvr> perry passed by on horseback </s>
<s> 
the gentlemen spoke of his horse </s>
<s> 

by the bye said frank churchill to <abvr> weston presently what
became of <abvr> perrys plan of setting up his carriage </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had
any such plan </s>
<s> 

nay i had it from you </s>
<s>  you wrote me word of it three months ago </s>

me </s>
<s>  impossible </s>
<s> 

indeed you did </s>
<s>  i remember it perfectly </s>
<s>  you mentioned it as what
was certainly to be very soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry had told somebody and was
extremely happy about it </s>

thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm </s>

must remember it now </s>

upon my word i never heard of it till this moment </s>

never </s>

what is this </s>

carriage </s>

<s>  i am glad he can
afford it </s>
<s>  you had it from himself had you </s>
<s> 

no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from
nobody </s>
<s> very odd </s>
<s> i really was persuaded of <abvr> westons having
mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all
these particularsbut as she declares she never heard a syllable of
it before of course it must have been a dream </s>
<s>  i am a great dreamer </s>

i dream of every body at highbury when i am awayand when i have gone

it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at enscombe </s>
<s>  perrys setting up his carriage </s>
<s>  and
his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his healthjust
what will happen i have no doubt some time or other </s>
<s>  only a little
premature </s>

<s> 
and at others what a heap of absurdities it is </s>
<s>  well frank your dream
certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent </s>
<s> 
emma you are a great dreamer i think </s>
<s> 

emma was out of hearing </s>
<s>  she had hurried on before her guests to
prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of <abvr>
westons hint </s>
<s> 

why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject
there is no denying that <abvr> frank churchill might havei do not mean
to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes the oddest
dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge
that there was such an idea last spring </s>
<s>  for <abvr> perry herself
mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as
ourselvesbut it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only
thought of about three days </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry was very anxious that he should
have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning
because she thought she had prevailed </s>
<s>  jane dont you remember
grandmamas telling us of it when we got home </s>
<s>  i forget where we
had been walking tovery likely to randalls </s>
<s>  yes i think it was to
randalls </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed
i do not know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence </s>
<s> 
she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go
beyond </s>

i know of </s>
<s>  at the same time i will not positively answer for my having
never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before

mrs </s>

they were entering the hall </s>

batess in a glance at jane </s>

involuntarily turned to hers </s>

with her shawl </s>

<s>  the two other gentlemen waited
at the door to let her pass </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley suspected in frank
churchill the determination of catching her eyehe seemed watching her
intentlyin vain however if it were sojane passed between them
into the hall and looked at neither </s>
<s> 

there was no time for farther remark or explanation </s>
<s>  the dream must be
borne with and <abvr> knightley must take his seat with the rest round the
large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and
which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her
father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke on which two of his
daily meals had for forty years been crowded </s>
<s>  tea passed pleasantly
and nobody seemed in a hurry to move </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind
him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their
alphabetstheir box of letters </s>
<s>  it used to stand here </s>
<s>  where is it </s>
<s> 
this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought to be treated rather
as winter than summer </s>
<s>  we had great amusement with those letters one
morning </s>
<s>  i want to puzzle you again </s>
<s> 

emma was pleased with the thought </s>
<s>  and producing the box the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves </s>
<s>  they were rapidly forming words
for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled </s>
<s>  the quietness
of the game made it particularly eligible for <abvr> woodhouse who had
often been distressed by the more animated sort which <abvr> weston had
occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting
with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys
 or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how
beautifully emma had written it </s>
<s> 

frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax </s>
<s>  she gave a slight
glance round the table and applied herself to it </s>
<s>  frank was next to
emma jane opposite to themand <abvr> knightley so placed as to see them
all </s>
<s>  and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little
apparent observation </s>
<s>  the word was discovered and with a faint smile
pushed away </s>
<s>  if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and
buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of
looking just across for it was not mixed </s>
<s>  and harriet eager after
every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to
work </s>
<s>  she was sitting by <abvr> knightley and turned to him for help </s>
<s>  the
word was blunder </s>
<s>  and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a
blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  knightley connected it with the dream </s>
<s>  but how it could all be
was beyond his comprehension </s>
<s>  how the delicacy the discretion of his
favourite could have been so lain asleep </s>
<s>  he feared there must be some
decided involvement </s>
<s>  disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet
him at every turn </s>
<s>  these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and
trick </s>
<s>  it was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank
churchills part </s>
<s> 

with great indignation did he continue to observe him </s>
<s>  with great alarm
and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions </s>
<s>  he saw a short
word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure </s>
<s>  he
saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining
though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure </s>
<s> 
for she said nonsense </s>
<s>  for shame </s>
<s>  he heard frank churchill next say
with a glance towards jane i will give it to hershall i </s>
<s> and as
clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth </s>
<s>  no no you
must not </s>
<s>  you shall not indeed </s>
<s> 

it was done however </s>
<s>  this gallant young man who seemed to love without
feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed
over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate
civility entreated her to study it </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightleys excessive curiosity
to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment
for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it
to be dixon </s>
<s>  jane fairfaxs perception seemed to accompany his </s>
<s> 
her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning
the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged </s>
<s>  she was
evidently displeased </s>
<s>  looked up and seeing herself watched blushed
more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not
know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even
an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word
that could be offered </s>
<s>  her face was averted from those who had made the
attack and turned towards her aunt </s>
<s> 

aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken
a wordi was just going to say the same thing </s>
<s>  it is time for us to be
going indeed </s>
<s>  the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking
for us </s>
<s>  my dear sir you are too obliging </s>
<s>  we really must wish you good
night </s>
<s> 

janes alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had
preconceived </s>
<s>  she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table </s>
<s>  but
so many were also moving that she could not get away </s>
<s>  and <abvr> knightley
thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards
her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined </s>
<s>  she was afterwards
looking for her shawlfrank churchill was looking alsoit was growing
dusk and the room was in confusion </s>
<s>  and how they parted <abvr> knightley
could not tell </s>

he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of
what he had seen </s>
<s>  so full that when the candles came to assist his
observations he mustyes he certainly must as a friendan anxious

<s>  he could not see her
in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her </s>
<s>  it was
his duty </s>
<s> 

pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the
poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax </s>
<s>  i saw the
word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the
one and so very distressing to the other </s>
<s> 

emma was extremely confused </s>
<s>  she could not endure to give him the true
explanation </s>
<s>  for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was
really ashamed of having ever imparted them </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing </s>
<s>  a mere
joke among ourselves </s>
<s> 

the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and <abvr>
churchill </s>
<s> 

he had hoped she would speak again but she did not </s>
<s>  she would rather
busy herself about any thing than speak </s>
<s>  he sat a little while in
doubt </s>
<s>  a variety of evils crossed his mind </s>
<s>  interferencefruitless
interference </s>

declare her affection engaged </s>

<s>  he owed it to her
to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference
rather than her welfare </s>

remembrance of neglect in such a cause </s>
<s> 

my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you

gentleman and lady we have been speaking of </s>

between <abvr> frank churchill and miss fairfax </s>

<s> why
do you make a doubt of it </s>

have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or
that she admired him </s>

never never </s>

twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me </s>

it possibly come into your head </s>

admiration between them i do assure you </s>
<s>  and the appearances which
have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstancesfeelings

explain </s>
<s> there is a good deal of nonsense in itbut the part which is
capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far

the world can be </s>
<s>  that is i presume it to be so on her side and i
can answer for its being so on his </s>
<s>  i will answer for the gentlemans
indifference </s>
<s> 

she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction
which silenced <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  she was in gay spirits and would have
prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his
suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a
circumstance which highly entertained her </s>

hers </s>

irritated for talking </s>

fever by the fire which <abvr> woodhouses tender habits required almost
every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty
leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey </s>

chapter vi


after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from <abvr> and <abvr>
suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn </s>
<s>  no such
importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at
present </s>
<s>  in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted
to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had
been united such as the last accounts of <abvr> churchill whose health
seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of <abvr>
weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much
increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was
by the approach of it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton was very much disappointed </s>
<s>  it was the delay of a great deal
of pleasure and parade </s>
<s>  her introductions and recommendations must all
wait and every projected party be still only talked of </s>
<s>  so she thought
at first </s>
<s> but a little consideration convinced her that every thing
need not be put off </s>
<s>  why should not they explore to box hill though
the sucklings did not come </s>
<s>  they could go there again with them in the
autumn </s>
<s>  it was settled that they should go to box hill </s>
<s>  that there was
to be such a party had been long generally known </s>
<s>  it had even given the
idea of another </s>
<s>  emma had never been to box hill </s>
<s>  she wished to see what
every body found so well worth seeing and she and <abvr> weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither </s>
<s>  two or three more of the
chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a
quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and
preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the
eltons and the sucklings </s>
<s> 

this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but
feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from <abvr> weston
that he had been proposing to <abvr> elton as her brother and sister had
failed her that the two parties should unite and go together </s>
<s>  and that
as <abvr> elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she
had no objection </s>
<s>  now as her objection was nothing but her very great
dislike of <abvr> elton of which <abvr> weston must already be perfectly
aware it was not worth bringing forward again </s>
<s> it could not be done
without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife </s>
<s>  and
she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which
she would have done a great deal to avoid </s>
<s>  an arrangement which would
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of <abvr>
eltons party </s>
<s>  every feeling was offended </s>
<s>  and the forbearance of her
outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her
reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of <abvr> westons temper </s>
<s> 

i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably </s>
<s> 
but i thought you would </s>
<s>  such schemes as these are nothing without
numbers </s>
<s>  one cannot have too large a party </s>
<s>  a large party secures its
own amusement </s>
<s>  and she is a goodnatured woman after all </s>
<s>  one could not
leave her out </s>
<s> 

emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private </s>
<s> 

it was now the middle of june and the weather fine </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton
was growing impatient to name the day and settle with <abvr> weston as to
pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw every thing
into sad uncertainty </s>
<s>  it might be weeks it might be only a few days
before the horse were useable </s>
<s>  but no preparations could be ventured
on and it was all melancholy stagnation </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons resources were
inadequate to such an attack </s>
<s> 

is not this most vexatious knightley </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s> and such weather
for exploring </s>
<s> these delays and disappointments are quite odious </s>
<s>  what
are we to do </s>
<s> the year will wear away at this rate and nothing

<s>  before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful
exploring party from maple grove to kings weston </s>

you had better explore to donwell replied <abvr> knightley </s>

be done without horses </s>
<s>  come and eat my strawberries </s>

if <abvr> knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so

it of all things was not plainer in words than manner </s>
<s>  donwell was
famous for its strawberrybeds which seemed a plea for the invitation </s>

the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere </s>

<s>

<s>  and jane will have such another </s>
<s>  there is to be
no form or paradea sort of gipsy party </s>

trees </s>

<s>  every thing as natural
and simple as possible </s>
<s>  is not that your idea </s>
<s> 

not quite </s>
<s>  my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the diningroom </s>

donkeys jane miss bates and meand my caro sposo walking by </s>

really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey </s>

you will not find either between donwell and highbury </s>

mr </s>

wished to persuade <abvr> woodhouse as well as emma to join the party </s>
<s>

eat would inevitably make him ill </s>

specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at

his easy credulity </s>

years </s>

very well </s>

<s>  elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment
to themselves </s>

pleasure from it </s>

in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to
box hill was again under happy consideration </s>

under a bright midday sun at almost midsummer <abvr> woodhouse was
safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of
this alfresco party </s>
<s>  and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the
abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was

it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was

around her </s>

observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must

<s> 

she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with
the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed
the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming

stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with
all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sightand its abundance
of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance

removal </s>

<s>  would not <abvr> knightley shew them the
gardensall the gardens </s>
<s> she wished to see the whole extent </s>
<s> the
pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear </s>
<s> 

it was hot </s>
<s>  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered
dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one
another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which
stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed
the finish of the pleasure grounds </s>
<s> it led to nothing </s>
<s>  nothing but a
view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed
intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to
the house which never had been there </s>
<s>  disputable however as might be
the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and
the view which closed it extremely pretty </s>
<s> the considerable slope at
nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds </s>
<s>  and at half a mile distant was a bank of
considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood </s>
<s> and at
the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the
abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and
handsome curve around it </s>
<s> 

it was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind </s>
<s>  english verdure
english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being
oppressive </s>
<s> 

in this walk emma and <abvr> weston found all the others assembled </s>
<s>  and
towards this view she immediately perceived <abvr> knightley and harriet
distinct from the rest quietly leading the way </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley and
harriet </s>
<s> it was an odd teteatete </s>
<s>  but she was glad to see it </s>
<s> there
had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and
turned from her with little ceremony </s>
<s>  now they seemed in pleasant
conversation </s>
<s>  there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry
to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm </s>
<s>  but now
she feared it not </s>
<s>  it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of
prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in
blossom and light column of smoke ascending </s>
<s> she joined them at the
wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around </s>
<s>  he
was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc </s>
<s>  and emma
received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns </s>
<s>  i have
a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of
introducing robert martin </s>
<s> she did not suspect him </s>
<s>  it was too old
a story </s>
<s> robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet </s>
<s> they
took a few turns together along the walk </s>
<s> the shade was most
refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day </s>
<s> 

the next remove was to the house </s>
<s>  they must all go in and eat </s>
<s> and they
were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston looked and looked in vain </s>
<s>  his father would not own himself
uneasy and laughed at her fears </s>
<s>  but she could not be cured of wishing
that he would part with his black mare </s>

coming with more than common certainty </s>

that he had not a doubt of getting over to them </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  churchills
state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such
sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable
dependenceand <abvr> weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say
that it must be by some attack of <abvr> churchill that he was
prevented coming </s>
<s> emma looked at harriet while the point was under
consideration </s>
<s>  she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion </s>
<s> 

the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see
what had not yet been seen the old abbey fishponds </s>
<s>  perhaps get as far
as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at

<s> mr </s>
<s> 
woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part
of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him
stirred no more </s>
<s>  and his daughter resolved to remain with him that

variety which her spirits seemed to need </s>

mr </s>

<s> before this second looking over was begun however emma
walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of

look of escape </s>

was a start at first </s>

quest of </s>
<s>

<s> my aunt is not aware how late it
is nor how long we have been absentbut i am sure we shall be wanted

<s>  it would only be giving trouble and distress </s>
<s>  some are gone to the
ponds and some to the lime walk </s>
<s>  till they all come in i shall not be
missed </s>
<s>  and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am
gone </s>
<s> 

certainly if you wish it </s>
<s> but you are not going to walk to highbury
alone </s>
<s> 

yeswhat should hurt me </s>
<s> i walk fast </s>
<s>  i shall be at home in twenty
minutes </s>

but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone </s>
<s>  let my

round in five minutes </s>
<s> 

thank you thank youbut on no account </s>
<s> i would rather walk </s>
<s> and
for me to be afraid of walking alone </s>
<s> i who may so soon have to
guard others </s>
<s> 

she spoke with great agitation </s>
<s>  and emma very feelingly replied that
can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now </s>
<s>  i must order the
carriage </s>
<s>  the heat even would be danger </s>
<s> you are fatigued already </s>
<s> 

i amshe answeredi am fatigued </s>

at times what it is to be wearied in spirits </s>

exhausted </s>
<s>  the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have
my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary </s>
<s> 

emma had not another word to oppose </s>
<s>  she saw it all </s>
<s>  and entering into
her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and
watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend </s>
<s>  her parting look was
gratefuland her parting words oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse the comfort of

<s> seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and
to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her

the hall again </s>

jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only
accomplished some views of st </s>

<s> absolute madness </s>
<s> 

emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of
humour </s>
<s>  some people were always cross when they were hot </s>
<s>  such might be
his constitution </s>
<s>  and as she knew that eating and drinking were often
the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking
some refreshment </s>

diningroomand she humanely pointed out the door </s>
<s> 

nohe should not eat </s>

<s>  it would only make him
hotter </s>

attention to her father saying in secret

employment </s>
<s>  and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late </s>

the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected </s>

with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill </s>

took it very composedly </s>

little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last
words to emma were

chapter vii


they had a very fine day for box hill </s>
<s>  and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in
favour of a pleasant party </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston directed the whole officiating
safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good
time </s>
<s>  emma and harriet went together </s>
<s>  miss bates and her niece with
the eltons </s>
<s>  the gentlemen on horseback </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston remained with <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s>  nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there </s>
<s> 
seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body
had a burst of admiration on first arriving </s>
<s>  but in the general amount
of the day there was deficiency </s>
<s>  there was a languor a want of spirits
a want of union which could not be got over </s>
<s>  they separated too much
into parties </s>
<s>  the eltons walked together </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley took charge of
miss bates and jane </s>
<s>  and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better </s>
<s>  it seemed
at first an accidental division but it never materially varied </s>
<s>  <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable
as they could </s>
<s>  but during the two whole hours that were spent on the
hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties
too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any
cheerful <abvr> weston to remove </s>
<s> 

at first it was downright dulness to emma </s>
<s>  she had never seen frank
churchill so silent and stupid </s>
<s>  he said nothing worth hearinglooked
without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without knowing
what she said </s>
<s>  while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet
should be dull likewise </s>
<s>  and they were both insufferable </s>
<s> 

when they all sat down it was better </s>
<s>  to her taste a great deal better
for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object </s>
<s> 
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her </s>
<s> 
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared
forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay
and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission
to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating
period of their acquaintance </s>
<s>  but which now in her own estimation
meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must
have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very
well describe </s>
<s>  <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together
excessively </s>
<s>  they were laying themselves open to that very phraseand
to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to
ireland by another </s>
<s>  not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any
real felicity </s>
<s>  it was rather because she felt less happy than she had
expected </s>
<s>  she laughed because she was disappointed </s>
<s>  and though she liked
him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship
admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning
back her heart </s>
<s>  she still intended him for her friend </s>
<s> 

how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come
today </s>
<s> if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all
the happiness of this party </s>
<s>  i had quite determined to go away again </s>
<s> 

yes you were very cross </s>
<s>  and i do not know what about except that you
were too late for the best strawberries </s>
<s>  i was a kinder friend than you
deserved </s>
<s>  but you were humble </s>

<s>

<s>  i was fatigued </s>

<s>

<s>

you are comfortable because you are under command </s>
<s>

<s>  you had
somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own
management </s>
<s>  but today you are got back againand as i cannot be always
with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command
rather than mine </s>
<s> 

it comes to the same thing </s>
<s>  i can have no selfcommand without a

<s>  i thought i had seen you

<s> 

your gallantry is really unanswerable </s>
<s>  but lowering her voicenobody

nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people </s>

understanding and gratification came together </s>

the rest of the party equally </s>

oh </s>

jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off </s>

hearing </s>
<s> how well they suit one another </s>
<s> very luckymarrying as they
did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place </s>

each other i think a few weeks in bath </s>
<s>  peculiarly lucky </s>
<s> for as to
any real knowledge of a persons disposition that bath or any public
place can giveit is all nothing </s>
<s>  there can be no knowledge </s>
<s>  it is
only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as
they always are that you can form any just judgment </s>
<s>  short of that it
is all guess and luckand will generally be illluck </s>
<s>  how many a man
has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest
of his life </s>
<s> 

miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own
confederates spoke now </s>
<s> 

such things do occur undoubtedly </s>
<s> she was stopped by a cough </s>
<s>  frank
churchill turned towards her to listen </s>
<s> 

you were speaking said he gravely </s>
<s>  she recovered her voice </s>
<s> 

i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be
very frequent </s>
<s>  a hasty and imprudent attachment may arisebut there is
generally time to recover from it afterwards </s>
<s>  i would be understood to
mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness
must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate
acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever </s>
<s> 

he made no answer </s>
<s>  merely looked and bowed in submission </s>
<s>  and soon
afterwards said in a lively tone

well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i
marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me </s>

emma </s>

<s> 

emma was in no danger of forgetting </s>
<s>  it was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling </s>
<s>  would not harriet be the very creature described </s>
<s> 
hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished </s>
<s> 
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment </s>

<s> 
referring the education to her seemed to imply it </s>

declare

they walked off followed in half a minute by <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
his son emma and harriet only remained </s>
<s>  and the young mans spirits
now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant </s>
<s>  even emma grew tired at last of
flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about
with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended
to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her </s>
<s>  the
appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the
carriages was a joyful sight </s>
<s>  and even the bustle of collecting and
preparing to depart and the solicitude of <abvr> elton to have her
carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive
home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of
pleasure </s>
<s>  such another scheme composed of so many illassorted people
she hoped never to be betrayed into again </s>
<s> 

while waiting for the carriage she found <abvr> knightley by her side </s>
<s>  he
looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said

emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do </s>
<s>  a
privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it </s>
<s> 
i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance </s>
<s>  how could you be
so unfeeling to miss bates </s>
<s>  how could you be so insolent in your wit to
a woman of her character age and situation </s>
<s> emma i had not thought
it possible </s>
<s> 

emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off </s>
<s> 

nay how could i help saying what i did </s>
<s> nobody could have helped it </s>
<s> 
it was not so very bad </s>
<s>  i dare say she did not understand me </s>
<s> 

i assure you she did </s>
<s>  she felt your full meaning </s>
<s>  she has talked of
it since </s>
<s>  i wish you could have heard how she talked of itwith what
candour and generosity </s>
<s>  i wish you could have heard her honouring your
forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for
ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be
so irksome </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world </s>
<s> 
but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most
unfortunately blended in her </s>
<s> 

they are blended said he i acknowledge </s>
<s>  and were she prosperous
i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over
the good </s>
<s>  were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless
absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any
liberties of manner </s>
<s>  were she your equal in situationbut emma
consider how far this is from being the case </s>

from the comforts she was born to </s>

probably sink more </s>
<s>  her situation should secure your compassion </s>
<s>  it was
badly done indeed </s>
<s>  you whom she had known from an infant whom she had
seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you
now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her

of her </s>

<s> 
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and
trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you
can do now </s>
<s> 

while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage </s>
<s>  it was
ready </s>
<s>  and before she could speak again he had handed her in </s>
<s>  he had
misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her
tongue motionless </s>
<s>  they were combined only of anger against herself
mortification and deep concern </s>
<s>  she had not been able to speak </s>
<s>  and on
entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcomethen reproaching
herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in
apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a
difference </s>
<s>  but it was just too late </s>
<s>  he had turned away and the horses
were in motion </s>
<s>  she continued to look back but in vain </s>
<s>  and soon with
what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and
every thing left far behind </s>
<s>  she was vexed beyond what could have been
expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal </s>
<s>  never had she felt so
agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life </s>
<s>  she was
most forcibly struck </s>
<s>  the truth of this representation there was no
denying </s>
<s>  she felt it at her heart </s>
<s>  how could she have been so brutal
so cruel to miss bates </s>
<s>  how could she have exposed herself to such ill
opinion in any one she valued </s>
<s>  and how suffer him to leave her without
saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness </s>
<s> 

time did not compose her </s>
<s>  as she reflected more she seemed but to feel
it more </s>
<s>  she never had been so depressed </s>
<s>  happily it was not necessary
to speak </s>
<s>  there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself
fagged and very willing to be silent </s>

down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to
check them extraordinary as they were </s>

chapter viii


the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all the
evening </s>
<s>  how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could
not tell </s>
<s>  they in their different homes and their different ways
might be looking back on it with pleasure </s>
<s>  but in her view it was
a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than
any she had ever passed </s>
<s>  a whole evening of backgammon with her father
was felicity to it </s>
<s>  there indeed lay real pleasure for there she
was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour to his comfort </s>
<s>  and
feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and
confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any
severe reproach </s>
<s>  as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart </s>
<s> 
she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling
to your father </s>
<s> i must i will tell you truths while i can </s>
<s>  miss
bates should never againno never </s>
<s>  if attention in future could do
away the past she might hope to be forgiven </s>
<s>  she had been often remiss
her conscience told her so </s>
<s>  remiss perhaps more in thought than fact </s>
<s> 
scornful ungracious </s>
<s>  but it should be so no more </s>
<s>  in the warmth of true
contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should
be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse </s>
<s> 

she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that
nothing might prevent her </s>
<s>  it was not unlikely she thought that she
might see <abvr> knightley in her way </s>
<s>  or perhaps he might come in
while she were paying her visit </s>
<s>  she had no objection </s>
<s>  she would not be
ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers </s>
<s> 
her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not </s>
<s> 

the ladies were all at home </s>
<s>  she had never rejoiced at the sound
before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs
with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of
deriving it except in subsequent ridicule </s>
<s> 

there was a bustle on her approach </s>
<s>  a good deal of moving and talking </s>
<s> 
she heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry </s>
<s>  the
maid looked frightened and awkward </s>
<s>  hoped she would be pleased to wait a
moment and then ushered her in too soon </s>
<s>  the aunt and niece seemed both
escaping into the adjoining room </s>
<s>  jane she had a distinct glimpse of
looking extremely ill </s>
<s>  and before the door had shut them out she heard
miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon
the bed and i am sure you are ill enough </s>
<s> 

poor old <abvr> bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not
quite understand what was going on </s>
<s> 

i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know </s>
<s>  they
tell me she is well </s>
<s>  i dare say my daughter will be here presently
miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i hope you find a chair </s>
<s>  i wish hetty had not gone </s>
<s>  i am
very little ablehave you a chair maam </s>
<s>  do you sit where you like </s>
<s>  i
am sure she will be here presently </s>
<s> 

emma seriously hoped she would </s>
<s>  she had a moments fear of miss bates
keeping away from her </s>
<s>  but miss bates soon camevery happy and
obligedbut emmas conscience told her that there was not the same
cheerful volubility as beforeless ease of look and manner </s>
<s>  a very
friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a
return of old feelings </s>
<s>  the touch seemed immediate </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse how kind you are </s>
<s> i suppose you have heardand
are come to give us joy </s>
<s>  this does not seem much like joy indeed in
metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be very trying for us
to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful
headache just now writing all the morning </s>
<s> such long letters you
know to be written to colonel campbell and <abvr> dixon </s>
<s>  ˜my dear said
i ˜you will blind yourselffor tears were in her eyes perpetually </s>
<s> 
one cannot wonder one cannot wonder </s>
<s>  it is a great change </s>
<s>  and though
she is amazingly fortunatesuch a situation i suppose as no
young woman before ever met with on first going outdo not think us
ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortuneagain
dispersing her tearsbut poor dear soul </s>
<s>  if you were to see what a
headache she has </s>
<s>  when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel
any blessing quite as it may deserve </s>
<s>  she is as low as possible </s>
<s>  to
look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have
secured such a situation </s>
<s>  you will excuse her not coming to youshe is
not ableshe is gone into her own roomi want her to lie down upon the
bed </s>
<s>  ˜my dear said i ˜i shall say you are laid down upon the bed </s>
<s> 
but however she is not </s>
<s>  she is walking about the room </s>
<s>  but now that
she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well </s>
<s>  she will
be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your
kindness will excuse her </s>
<s>  you were kept waiting at the doori was quite
ashamedbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that
we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not
know any body was coming </s>
<s>  ˜it is only <abvr> cole said i ˜depend upon
it </s>
<s>  nobody else would come so early </s>
<s>  ˜well said she ˜it must be
borne some time or other and it may as well be now </s>
<s>  but then patty
came in and said it was you </s>
<s>  ˜oh </s>
<s>  said i ˜it is miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i am
sure you will like to see her </s>
<s> ˜i can see nobody said she </s>
<s>  and
up she got and would go away </s>
<s>  and that was what made us keep you
waitingand extremely sorry and ashamed we were </s>
<s>  ˜if you must go my
dear said i ˜you must and i will say you are laid down upon the
bed </s>
<s> 

emma was most sincerely interested </s>
<s>  her heart had been long growing
kinder towards jane </s>
<s>  and this picture of her present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but
pity </s>
<s>  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of
the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on
seeing <abvr> cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear
to see herself </s>
<s>  she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and
solicitudesincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected
from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for
miss fairfaxs advantage and comfort as possible </s>
<s>  it must be a severe
trial to them all </s>
<s>  she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel
campbells return </s>
<s> 

so very kind </s>
<s>  replied miss bates </s>
<s>  but you are always kind </s>
<s> 

there was no bearing such an always </s>
<s>  and to break through her dreadful
gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of

wheremay i ask </s>
<s> is miss fairfax going </s>
<s> 

to a <abvr> smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have the charge
of her three little girlsdelightful children </s>
<s>  impossible that any
situation could be more replete with comfort </s>
<s>  if we except perhaps
mrs </s>
<s>  sucklings own family and <abvr> bragges </s>
<s>  but <abvr> smallridge is
intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood </s>
<s> lives only four
miles from maple grove </s>
<s>  jane will be only four miles from maple grove </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes

yes our good <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the most indefatigable true friend </s>
<s>  she
would not take a denial </s>
<s>  she would not let jane say ˜no </s>
<s>  for when jane
first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning
we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided
against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention </s>
<s>  exactly
as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel
campbells return and nothing should induce her to enter into any
engagement at presentand so she told <abvr> elton over and over
againand i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her
mind </s>
<s> but that good <abvr> elton whose judgment never fails her saw
farther than i did </s>
<s>  it is not every body that would have stood out in
such a kind way as she did and refuse to take janes answer </s>
<s>  but she
positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as
jane wished her </s>
<s>  she would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it
was all settled that jane should go </s>
<s>  quite a surprize to me </s>
<s>  i had not
the least idea </s>
<s> jane took <abvr> elton aside and told her at once that
upon thinking over the advantages of <abvr> smallridges situation she
had come to the resolution of accepting it </s>
<s> i did not know a word of it
till it was all settled </s>
<s> 

you spent the evening with <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

yes all of us </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton would have us come </s>
<s>  it was settled so upon
the hill while we were walking about with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  ˜you must
all spend your evening with us said she˜i positively must have you
all come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was there too was he </s>
<s> 

no not <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he declined it from the first </s>
<s>  and though i
thought he would come because <abvr> elton declared she would not let him
off he did not </s>
<s> but my mother and jane and i were all there and
a very agreeable evening we had </s>
<s>  such kind friends you know miss
woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed
rather fagged after the mornings party </s>
<s>  even pleasure you know is
fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have
enjoyed it </s>
<s>  however i shall always think it a very pleasant party
and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it </s>
<s> 

miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been
making up her mind the whole day </s>
<s> 

i dare say she had </s>
<s> 

whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her
friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is
possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family </s>
<s> 

thank you dear miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  yes indeed there is every thing
in the world that can make her happy in it </s>
<s>  except the sucklings and
bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal
and elegant in all <abvr> eltons acquaintance </s>
<s>  <abvr> smallridge a most
delightful woman </s>
<s> a style of living almost equal to maple groveand as
to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there
are not such elegant sweet children anywhere </s>
<s>  jane will be treated with
such regard and kindness </s>
<s> it will be nothing but pleasure a life of
pleasure </s>
<s> and her salary </s>
<s> i really cannot venture to name her salary
to you miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  even you used as you are to great sums would
hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i
remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of
what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly
earned </s>
<s> 

you are so noble in your ideas </s>
<s> 

and when is miss fairfax to leave you </s>
<s> 

very soon very soon indeed </s>
<s>  thats the worst of it </s>
<s>  within a
fortnight </s>
<s>  <abvr> smallridge is in a great hurry </s>
<s>  my poor mother does not
know how to bear it </s>
<s>  so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and
say come maam do not let us think about it any more </s>
<s> 

her friends must all be sorry to lose her </s>
<s>  and will not colonel and
mrs </s>
<s>  campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their
return </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  jane says she is sure they will </s>
<s>  but yet this is such a situation
as she cannot feel herself justified in declining </s>
<s>  i was so astonished
when she first told me what she had been saying to <abvr> elton and when
mrs </s>
<s>  elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it </s>
<s>  it was
before teastayno it could not be before tea because we were
just going to cardsand yet it was before tea because i remember
thinkingoh </s>
<s>  no now i recollect now i have it </s>
<s>  something happened
before tea but not that </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was called out of the room before
tea old john abdys son wanted to speak with him </s>
<s>  poor old john i
have a great regard for him </s>
<s>  he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven
years </s>
<s>  and now poor old man he is bedridden and very poorly with the
rheumatic gout in his jointsi must go and see him today </s>
<s>  and so will
jane i am sure if she gets out at all </s>
<s>  and poor johns son came to
talk to <abvr> elton about relief from the parish </s>
<s>  he is very well to do
himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing
of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help </s>
<s> 
and so when <abvr> elton came back he told us what john ostler had been
telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to
randalls to take <abvr> frank churchill to richmond </s>
<s>  that was what happened
before tea </s>
<s>  it was after tea that jane spoke to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this
circumstance was to her </s>
<s>  but as without supposing it possible that she
could be ignorant of any of the particulars of <abvr> frank churchills
going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence </s>
<s> 

what <abvr> elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the
accumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge of the
servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond
soon after the return of the party from box hillwhich messenger
however had been no more than was expected </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> churchill had
sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable
account of <abvr> churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming
back beyond the next morning early </s>
<s>  but that <abvr> frank churchill having
resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse
seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the
crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy
going a good pace and driving very steady </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it
caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject which already
engaged her mind </s>
<s>  the contrast between <abvr> churchills importance in
the world and jane fairfaxs struck her </s>
<s>  one was every thing the
other nothingand she sat musing on the difference of womans destiny
and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss
batess saying

aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte </s>
<s>  what is to become
of that </s>
<s> very true </s>
<s>  poor dear jane was talking of it just now </s>
<s> ˜you
must go said she </s>
<s>  ˜you and i must part </s>
<s>  you will have no business
here </s>
<s> let it stay however said she </s>
<s>  ˜give it houseroom till colonel
campbell comes back </s>
<s>  i shall talk about it to him </s>
<s>  he will settle for
me </s>
<s>  he will help me out of all my difficulties </s>
<s> and to this day i do
believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters </s>
<s> 

now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte </s>
<s>  and the remembrance of
all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough </s>
<s> 
and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of
the good wishes which she really felt took leave </s>
<s> 



chapter ix


emmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted </s>

knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting
with her father </s>

and miss bates <abvr> knightley as i told you before </s>
<s>  she is always so
attentive to them </s>
<s> 

emmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise </s>
<s>  and with a
smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in
her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that
had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured </s>
<s> 
he looked at her with a glow of regard </s>
<s>  she was warmly gratifiedand in
another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common
friendliness on his part </s>
<s> he took her hand </s>
<s> whether she had not
herself made the first motion she could not sayshe might perhaps
have rather offered itbut he took her hand pressed it and certainly
was on the point of carrying it to his lipswhen from some fancy or
other he suddenly let it go </s>
<s> why he should feel such a scruple why
he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not
perceive </s>
<s> he would have judged better she thought if he had not
stopped </s>
<s> the intention however was indubitable </s>
<s>  and whether it was
that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it
happened but she thought nothing became him more </s>
<s> it was with him
of so simple yet so dignified a nature </s>
<s> she could not but recall the
attempt with great satisfaction </s>
<s>  it spoke such perfect amity </s>
<s> he left
them immediately afterwardsgone in a moment </s>
<s>  he always moved with the
alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but
now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance </s>
<s> 

emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she
had left her ten minutes earlier </s>
<s> it would have been a great pleasure
to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> neither
would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she
knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have happened
at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it would have been
pleasanter </s>
<s> they parted thorough friends however </s>
<s>  she could not
be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished
gallantry </s>
<s> it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered
his good opinion </s>
<s> he had been sitting with them half an hour she
found </s>
<s>  it was a pity that she had not come back earlier </s>
<s> 

in the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness
of <abvr> knightleys going to london </s>
<s>  and going so suddenly </s>
<s>  and going on
horseback which she knew would be all very bad </s>
<s>  emma communicated her
news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified </s>
<s> 
it supplied a very useful checkinterested without disturbing him </s>
<s>  he
had long made up his mind to jane fairfaxs going out as governess and
could talk of it cheerfully but <abvr> knightleys going to london had
been an unexpected blow </s>
<s> 

i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably
settled </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton is very goodnatured and agreeable and i dare say
her acquaintance are just what they ought to be </s>
<s>  i hope it is a dry
situation and that her health will be taken good care of </s>
<s>  it ought to
be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me </s>
<s> 
you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor
was to us </s>

induced to go away after it has been her home so long </s>
<s> 

the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else
into the background </s>
<s>  an express arrived at randalls to announce the
death of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  though her nephew had had no particular reason
to hasten back on her account she had not lived above sixandthirty
hours after his return </s>
<s>  a sudden seizure of a different nature from any
thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short
struggle </s>
<s>  the great <abvr> churchill was no more </s>
<s> 

it was felt as such things must be felt </s>
<s>  every body had a degree of
gravity and sorrow </s>
<s>  tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the
surviving friends </s>
<s>  and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where
she would be buried </s>
<s>  goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops
to folly she has nothing to do but to die </s>
<s>  and when she stoops to be
disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill after being disliked at least twentyfive years was
now spoken of with compassionate allowances </s>
<s>  in one point she was fully
justified </s>
<s>  she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill </s>
<s>  the
event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of
imaginary complaints </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  no doubt she had been suffering a great deal </s>
<s> 
more than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try the
temper </s>
<s>  it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults what
would <abvr> churchill do without her </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchills loss would be
dreadful indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill would never get over it </s>
<s> even <abvr>
weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah </s>
<s>  poor woman
who would have thought it </s>
<s>  and resolved that his mourning should be as
handsome as possible </s>
<s>  and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her
broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady </s>
<s>  how it
would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both </s>
<s>  it was also
a very early speculation with emma </s>
<s>  the character of <abvr> churchill
the grief of her husbandher mind glanced over them both with awe and
compassionand then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might
be affected by the event how benefited how freed </s>
<s>  she saw in a moment
all the possible good </s>
<s>  now an attachment to harriet smith would have
nothing to encounter </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill independent of his wife was feared
by nobody </s>
<s>  an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his
nephew </s>
<s>  all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form
the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed </s>
<s> 

harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand </s>
<s> 
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing </s>
<s>  emma
was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance </s>
<s> 
they spoke therefore of <abvr> churchills death with mutual
forbearance </s>
<s> 

short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all
that was immediately important of their state and plans </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill
was better than could be expected </s>
<s>  and their first removal on the
departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very
old friend in windsor to whom <abvr> churchill had been promising a
visit the last ten years </s>
<s>  at present there was nothing to be done for
harriet </s>
<s>  good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible
on emmas side </s>
<s> 

it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose
prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose engagements
now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her
kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish </s>
<s>  she had scarcely
a stronger regret than for her past coldness </s>
<s>  and the person whom she
had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she
would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy </s>
<s>  she wanted
to be of use to her </s>
<s>  wanted to shew a value for her society and testify
respect and consideration </s>
<s>  she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day
at hartfield </s>
<s>  a note was written to urge it </s>
<s>  the invitation was refused
and by a verbal message </s>
<s>  miss fairfax was not well enough to write </s>
<s> 
 and when <abvr> perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared
that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against
her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe
headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the
possibility of her going to <abvr> smallridges at the time proposed </s>
<s> 
her health seemed for the moment completely derangedappetite quite
goneand though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing
touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension
of the family <abvr> perry was uneasy about her </s>
<s>  he thought she had
undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself
though she would not own it </s>
<s>  her spirits seemed overcome </s>
<s>  her
present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous
disorder </s>
<s> confined always to one room </s>
<s> he could have wished it
otherwiseand her good aunt though his very old friend he must
acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that
description </s>
<s>  her care and attention could not be questioned </s>
<s>  they were
in fact only too great </s>
<s>  he very much feared that miss fairfax derived
more evil than good from them </s>
<s>  emma listened with the warmest concern </s>
<s> 
grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some
way of being useful </s>
<s>  to take herbe it only an hour or twofrom
her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational
conversation even for an hour or two might do her good </s>
<s>  and the
following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language
she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any
hour that jane would namementioning that she had <abvr> perrys decided
opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient </s>
<s>  the answer was only
in this short note </s>
<s> 

miss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any
exercise </s>
<s> 

emma felt that her own note had deserved something better </s>
<s>  but it was
impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed
indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best
counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted </s>
<s>  in spite of the
answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to <abvr> batess
in the hope that jane would be induced to join herbut it would not
do </s>
<s> miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing
with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest
serviceand every thing that message could do was triedbut all in
vain </s>
<s>  miss bates was obliged to return without success </s>
<s>  jane was
quite unpersuadable </s>
<s>  the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her
worse </s>
<s> emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers </s>
<s> 
but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear
that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in </s>
<s> 
indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any
bodyany body at allmrs </s>
<s>  elton indeed could not be deniedand
mrs </s>
<s>  cole had made such a pointand <abvr> perry had said so muchbut
except them jane would really see nobody </s>
<s> 

emma did not want to be classed with the <abvr> eltons the <abvr> perrys
and the <abvr> coles who would force themselves anywhere </s>
<s>  neither could
she feel any right of preference herselfshe submitted therefore and
only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieces appetite and diet
which she longed to be able to assist </s>
<s>  on that subject poor miss bates
was very unhappy and very communicative </s>
<s>  jane would hardly eat any
thing </s>
<s> <abvr> perry recommended nourishing food </s>
<s>  but every thing
they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was
distasteful </s>
<s> 

emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an
examination of her stores </s>
<s>  and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note </s>
<s>  in half
an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss
bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent
back </s>
<s>  it was a thing she could not takeand moreover she insisted on
her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing </s>
<s> 

when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of
the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any
exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage
she could have no doubtputting every thing togetherthat jane was
resolved to receive no kindness from her </s>
<s>  she was sorry very sorry </s>
<s> 
her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable
from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and
inequality of powers </s>
<s>  and it mortified her that she was given so little
credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend </s>
<s>  but
she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of
being able to say to herself that could <abvr> knightley have been privy
to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen
into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to
reprove </s>

chapter x


one morning about ten days after <abvr> churchills decease emma was
called downstairs to <abvr> weston who could not stay five minutes
and wanted particularly to speak with her </s>
<s> he met her at the
parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of
his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father

possible </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston wants to see you </s>

<s>  you will know it all in
time </s>
<s>  the most unaccountable business </s>
<s>  but hush hush </s>
<s> 

to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma </s>
<s>  something
really important seemed announced by his looks </s>
<s>  but as her friend was
well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father
that she would take her walk now she and <abvr> weston were soon out of
the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls </s>

<s> 

upon my honour said he very seriously it does not </s>
<s>  it is not in

<s> in short my
dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it </s>
<s>  i dont
say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much
worse </s>
<s> if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls </s>

emma found that she must wait </s>

asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and

<s>  half a dozen natural

undesirable would be no matter of agony to her </s>

proceededspeaking more to assist <abvr> weston in keeping his secret
than with any other view </s>
<s>

oh </s>

<s> well well never mind </s>
<s> 

for a moment he was silent </s>
<s>  and then added in a tone much more guarded
and demure

<s> 

they hurried on and were speedily at randalls </s>
<s> well my dear said
he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now i hope you
will soon be better </s>

<s> and emma distinctly
heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the roomi have
been as good as my word </s>
<s>  she has not the least idea </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation
that emmas uneasiness increased </s>
<s>  and the moment they were alone she
eagerly said

<s>  something of a very unpleasant nature i
find has occurred </s>
<s> do let me know directly what it is </s>
<s>  i have been
walking all this way in complete suspense </s>
<s>  we both abhor suspense </s>

cannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to
hear </s>
<s> 

so far as that it relates to <abvr> frank churchill i do guess </s>
<s> 

you are right </s>
<s>  it does relate to him and i will tell you directly </s>
<s> 
 resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up </s>
<s>  he has
been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand </s>
<s>  it is
impossible to express our surprize </s>
<s>  he came to speak to his father on a
subjectto announce an attachment

harriet </s>
<s> 

more than an attachment indeed resumed <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  an
engagementa positive engagement </s>
<s> what will you say emmawhat will
any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are
engaged </s>
<s> nay that they have been long engaged </s>
<s> 

emma even jumped with surprize </s>
<s> and horrorstruck exclaimed

jane fairfax </s>
<s> good god </s>
<s>  you are not serious </s>
<s>  you do not mean it </s>
<s> 

you may well be amazed returned <abvr> weston still averting her eyes
and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover
you may well be amazed </s>
<s>  but it is even so </s>
<s>  there has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth and
kept a secret from every body </s>
<s>  not a creature knowing it but
themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor his </s>
<s> it is so
wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost
incredible to myself </s>
<s>  i can hardly believe it </s>
<s> i thought i knew him </s>
<s> 

emma scarcely heard what was said </s>
<s> her mind was divided between two
ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax </s>
<s>  and
poor harriet </s>
<s> and for some time she could only exclaim and require
confirmation repeated confirmation </s>
<s> 

well said she at last trying to recover herself </s>
<s>  this is a
circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at
all comprehend it </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s> engaged to her all the winterbefore either
of them came to highbury </s>
<s> 

engaged since octobersecretly engaged </s>
<s> it has hurt me emma very
much </s>
<s>  it has hurt his father equally </s>
<s>  some part of his conduct we
cannot excuse </s>
<s> 

emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend not to
understand you </s>
<s>  and to give you all the relief in my power be assured
that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are
apprehensive of </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston looked up afraid to believe </s>
<s>  but emmas countenance was as
steady as her words </s>
<s> 

that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my
present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i
did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to himnay
was attachedand how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder </s>
<s> 
fortunately however it did cease </s>
<s>  i have really for some time past
for at least these three months cared nothing about him </s>
<s>  you may
believe me <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  this is the simple truth </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston kissed her with tears of joy </s>
<s>  and when she could find
utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good
than any thing else in the world could do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she </s>
<s>  on
this point we have been wretched </s>
<s>  it was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so </s>
<s> 
imagine what we have been feeling on your account </s>
<s> 

i have escaped </s>
<s>  and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful
wonder to you and myself </s>
<s>  but this does not acquit him <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
and i must say that i think him greatly to blame </s>
<s>  what right had he
to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners
so very disengaged </s>
<s>  what right had he to endeavour to please as
he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with persevering
attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged to
another </s>
<s> how could he tell what mischief he might be doing </s>
<s> how could
he tell that he might not be making me in love with him </s>
<s> very wrong
very wrong indeed </s>
<s> 

from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine

and how could she bear such behaviour </s>
<s>  composure with a witness </s>
<s> 
to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman
before her face and not resent it </s>
<s> that is a degree of placidity
which i can neither comprehend nor respect </s>
<s> 

there were misunderstandings between them emma </s>
<s>  he said so expressly </s>
<s> 
he had not time to enter into much explanation </s>
<s>  he was here only a
quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow
the full use even of the time he could staybut that there had been
misunderstandings he decidedly said </s>
<s>  the present crisis indeed
seemed to be brought on by them </s>
<s>  and those misunderstandings might very
possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct </s>
<s> 

impropriety </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> westonit is too calm a censure </s>
<s>  much much
beyond impropriety </s>
<s> it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him
in my opinion </s>
<s>  so unlike what a man should be </s>
<s> none of that upright
integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of
trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of
his life </s>
<s> 

nay dear emma now i must take his part </s>
<s>  for though he has been wrong
in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having
many very many good qualities </s>
<s>  and

good god </s>
<s>  cried emma not attending to her </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  smallridge too </s>
<s> 
jane actually on the point of going as governess </s>
<s>  what could he mean by
such horrible indelicacy </s>
<s>  to suffer her to engage herselfto suffer her
even to think of such a measure </s>
<s> 

he knew nothing about it emma </s>
<s>  on this article i can fully acquit
him </s>
<s>  it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to himor at
least not communicated in a way to carry conviction </s>
<s> till yesterday i
know he said he was in the dark as to her plans </s>
<s>  they burst on him i do
not know how but by some letter or messageand it was the discovery of
what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him
to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on
his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of
concealment that had been carrying on so long </s>
<s> 

emma began to listen better </s>
<s> 

i am to hear from him soon continued <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  he told me at
parting that he should soon write </s>
<s>  and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now </s>
<s>  let
us wait therefore for this letter </s>
<s>  it may bring many extenuations </s>
<s>  it
may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to
be understood </s>
<s>  dont let us be severe dont let us be in a hurry to
condemn him </s>
<s>  let us have patience </s>
<s>  i must love him </s>
<s>  and now that i am
satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious
for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may </s>
<s>  they must
both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and
concealment </s>
<s> 

his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him
much harm </s>
<s>  well and how did <abvr> churchill take it </s>
<s> 

most favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely a
difficulty </s>
<s>  conceive what the events of a week have done in that family </s>
<s> 
while poor <abvr> churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a
hope a chance a possibility </s>
<s> but scarcely are her remains at rest in
the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite
to what she would have required </s>
<s>  what a blessing it is when undue
influence does not survive the grave </s>
<s> he gave his consent with very
little persuasion </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thought emma he would have done as much for harriet </s>
<s> 

this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this
morning </s>
<s>  he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy some timeand
then came on hither </s>
<s>  but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle
to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you
he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour </s>
<s> he was very much
agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made him appear quite
a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before </s>
<s> in
addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so
very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion ofand there was
every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal </s>
<s> 

and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such
perfect secresy </s>
<s> the campbells the dixons did none of them know of
the engagement </s>
<s> 

emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush </s>
<s> 

none </s>
<s>  not one </s>
<s>  he positively said that it had been known to no being in
the world but their two selves </s>
<s> 

well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the
idea and i wish them very happy </s>
<s>  but i shall always think it a
very abominable sort of proceeding </s>
<s>  what has it been but a system of
hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treachery </s>
<s> to come among us with
professions of openness and simplicity </s>
<s>  and such a league in secret
to judge us all </s>
<s> here have we been the whole winter and spring
completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth
and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been
carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and
words that were never meant for both to hear </s>
<s> they must take the
consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not
perfectly agreeable </s>
<s> 

i am quite easy on that head replied <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i am very sure
that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not
have heard </s>
<s> 

you are in luck </s>
<s> your only blunder was confined to my ear when you
imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady </s>

true </s>
<s>  but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss
fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her </s>

at this moment <abvr> weston appeared at a little distance from the window
evidently on the watch </s>

in </s>

intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease

why should we </s>
<s>  and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for
frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such
steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her
credit forand still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of
this one great deviation from the strict rule of right </s>
<s>  and how much may
be said in her situation for even that error </s>
<s> 

much indeed </s>
<s>  cried emma feelingly </s>
<s>  if a woman can ever be
excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane
fairfaxs </s>
<s> of such one may almost say that ˜the world is not theirs
nor the worlds law </s>
<s> 

she met <abvr> weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance
exclaiming

a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word </s>
<s>  this was a
device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of
guessing </s>
<s>  but you really frightened me </s>
<s>  i thought you had lost half
your property at least </s>
<s>  and here instead of its being a matter of
condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation </s>
<s> i congratulate
you <abvr> weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the
most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter </s>
<s> 

a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as
right as this speech proclaimed </s>

immediate </s>
<s>  his air and voice recovered their usual briskness </s>
<s>  he shook
her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in

the engagement no very bad thing </s>

could palliate imprudence or smooth objections </s>
<s>  and by the time they
had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again

chapter xi


harriet poor harriet </s>
<s> those were the words </s>
<s>  in them lay the
tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her </s>
<s>  frank churchill had behaved very
ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much his
behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him </s>
<s>  it was the
scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account that gave the
deepest hue to his offence </s>
<s> poor harriet </s>
<s>  to be a second time the
dupe of her misconceptions and flattery </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had spoken
prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend
to harriet smith </s>
<s> she was afraid she had done her nothing but
disservice </s>
<s> it was true that she had not to charge herself in this
instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of
the mischief </s>
<s>  with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise
never have entered harriets imagination </s>
<s>  for harriet had acknowledged
her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever
given her a hint on the subject </s>
<s>  but she felt completely guilty
of having encouraged what she might have repressed </s>
<s>  she might have
prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments </s>
<s>  her influence
would have been enough </s>
<s>  and now she was very conscious that she ought
to have prevented them </s>
<s> she felt that she had been risking her friends
happiness on most insufficient grounds </s>
<s>  common sense would have directed
her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him
and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring
for her </s>
<s> but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had
little to do </s>
<s> 

she was extremely angry with herself </s>
<s>  if she could not have been angry
with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful </s>
<s> as for jane
fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present
solicitude on her account </s>
<s>  harriet would be anxiety enough </s>
<s>  she need
no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose illhealth
having of course the same origin must be equally under cure </s>
<s> her
days of insignificance and evil were over </s>
<s> she would soon be well and
happy and prosperous </s>
<s> emma could now imagine why her own attentions
had been slighted </s>
<s>  this discovery laid many smaller matters open </s>
<s>  no
doubt it had been from jealousy </s>
<s> in janes eyes she had been a rival </s>
<s> 
and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be
repulsed </s>
<s>  an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison </s>
<s>  she
understood it all </s>
<s>  and as far as her mind could disengage itself from
the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that
jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her
desert </s>
<s>  but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge </s>
<s>  there was little
sympathy to be spared for any body else </s>
<s>  emma was sadly fearful
that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first </s>
<s> 
considering the very superior claims of the object it ought </s>
<s>  and
judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriets mind producing
reserve and selfcommand it would </s>
<s> she must communicate the painful
truth however and as soon as possible </s>
<s>  an injunction of secresy had
been among <abvr> westons parting words </s>
<s>  for the present the whole
affair was to be completely a secret </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill had made a point of
it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost </s>
<s> 
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum </s>
<s> emma had
promised </s>
<s>  but still harriet must be excepted </s>
<s>  it was her superior duty </s>
<s> 

in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost
ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate
office to perform by harriet which <abvr> weston had just gone through by
herself </s>
<s>  the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another </s>
<s>  her heart beat quick
on hearing harriets footstep and voice </s>
<s>  so she supposed had poor <abvr>
weston felt when she was approaching randalls </s>
<s>  could the event of
the disclosure bear an equal resemblance </s>
<s> but of that unfortunately
there could be no chance </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  cried harriet coming eagerly into the roomis
not this the oddest news that ever was </s>
<s> 

what news do you mean </s>
<s>  replied emma unable to guess by look or
voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint </s>
<s> 

about jane fairfax </s>
<s>  did you ever hear any thing so strange </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> you
need not be afraid of owning it to me for <abvr> weston has told me
himself </s>
<s>  i met him just now </s>
<s>  he told me it was to be a great secret </s>
<s> 
and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you
but he said you knew it </s>
<s> 

what did <abvr> weston tell you </s>
<s> said emma still perplexed </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he told me all about it </s>
<s>  that jane fairfax and <abvr> frank churchill
are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one
another this long while </s>
<s>  how very odd </s>
<s> 

it was indeed so odd </s>
<s>  harriets behaviour was so extremely odd
that emma did not know how to understand it </s>
<s>  her character appeared
absolutely changed </s>
<s>  she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or
disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery </s>
<s>  emma looked at
her quite unable to speak </s>
<s> 

had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her </s>
<s> you
perhaps might </s>
<s> you blushing as she spoke who can see into every
bodys heart </s>
<s>  but nobody else

upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent </s>
<s> 
can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached
to another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not
openlyencouraging you to give way to your own feelings </s>
<s> i never
had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of <abvr> frank
churchills having the least regard for jane fairfax </s>
<s>  you may be very
sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  cried harriet colouring and astonished </s>
<s>  why should you caution
me </s>
<s> you do not think i care about <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s> 

i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied
emma smiling </s>
<s>  but you do not mean to deny that there was a timeand
not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason to understand that you
did care about him </s>
<s> 

him </s>
<s> never never </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me </s>
<s> 
 turning away distressed </s>
<s> 

harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you mean </s>
<s> good
heaven </s>
<s>  what do you mean </s>
<s> mistake you </s>
<s> am i to suppose then </s>
<s> 

she could not speak another word </s>
<s> her voice was lost </s>
<s>  and she sat down
waiting in great terror till harriet should answer </s>
<s> 

harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from
her did not immediately say any thing </s>
<s>  and when she did speak it was
in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas </s>
<s> 

i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have
misunderstood me </s>
<s>  i know we agreed never to name himbut considering
how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have
thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill indeed </s>
<s>  i do not know who would ever look at him in
the company of the other </s>
<s>  i hope i have a better taste than to think of
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill who is like nobody by his side </s>
<s>  and that you should
have been so mistaken is amazing </s>
<s> i am sure but for believing that
you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i
should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost
to dare to think of him </s>
<s>  at first if you had not told me that more
wonderful things had happened </s>
<s>  that there had been matches of greater
disparity those were your very words </s>
<s> i should not have dared to
give way toi should not have thought it possiblebut if you who
had been always acquainted with him

harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us understand
each other now without the possibility of farther mistake </s>
<s>  are you
speaking ofmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> 

to be sure i am </s>
<s>  i never could have an idea of any body elseand so
i thought you knew </s>
<s>  when we talked about him it was as clear as
possible </s>
<s> 

not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then
said appeared to me to relate to a different person </s>
<s>  i could almost
assert that you had named <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  i am sure the service
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the
gipsies was spoken of </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse how you do forget </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on
the occasion </s>
<s>  i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment </s>
<s> 
that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely
natural </s>
<s> and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to
your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had
been in seeing him come forward to your rescue </s>
<s> the impression of it is
strong on my memory </s>
<s> 

oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean </s>
<s>  but i
was thinking of something very different at the time </s>
<s>  it was not the
gipsiesit was not <abvr> frank churchill that i meant </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  with some
elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstanceof <abvr>
knightleys coming and asking me to dance when <abvr> elton would not
stand up with me </s>
<s>  and when there was no other partner in the room </s>
<s>  that
was the kind action </s>
<s>  that was the noble benevolence and generosity </s>
<s>  that
was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every
other being upon earth </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  cried emma this has been a most unfortunatemost
deplorable mistake </s>
<s> what is to be done </s>
<s> 

you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me </s>
<s>  at
least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the
other had been the person </s>
<s>  and nowit is possible

she paused a few moments </s>
<s>  emma could not speak </s>
<s> 

i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a
great difference between the two as to me or as to any body </s>
<s>  you must
think one five hundred million times more above me than the other </s>
<s>  but
i hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat ifstrange as it may
appear </s>
<s>  but you know they were your own words that more wonderful
things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than
between <abvr> frank churchill and me </s>
<s>  and therefore it seems as if such
a thing even as this may have occurred beforeand if i should be so
fortunate beyond expression as toif <abvr> knightley should reallyif
he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will
not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way </s>
<s>  but
you are too good for that i am sure </s>
<s> 

harriet was standing at one of the windows </s>
<s>  emma turned round to look at
her in consternation and hastily said

have you any idea of <abvr> knightleys returning your affection </s>
<s> 

yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say that i
have </s>
<s> 

emmas eyes were instantly withdrawn </s>
<s>  and she sat silently meditating
in a fixed attitude for a few minutes </s>
<s>  a few minutes were sufficient
for making her acquainted with her own heart </s>
<s>  a mind like hers
once opening to suspicion made rapid progress </s>
<s>  she touchedshe
admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth </s>
<s>  why was it so much worse
that harriet should be in love with <abvr> knightley than with frank
churchill </s>
<s>  why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriets having
some hope of a return </s>
<s>  it darted through her with the speed of an
arrow that <abvr> knightley must marry no one but herself </s>
<s> 

her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same
few minutes </s>
<s>  she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed
her before </s>
<s>  how improperly had she been acting by harriet </s>
<s>  how
inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been
her conduct </s>
<s>  what blindness what madness had led her on </s>
<s>  it struck her
with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the
world </s>
<s>  some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all
these demeritssome concern for her own appearance and a strong sense
of justice by harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the
girl who believed herself loved by <abvr> knightleybut justice required
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the
resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent
kindness </s>
<s> for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost
extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into </s>
<s>  and harriet had done
nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily
formed and maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by the person whose
counsels had never led her right </s>
<s> rousing from reflection therefore
and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more
inviting accent renewed the conversation </s>
<s>  for as to the subject which
had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was
quite sunk and lost </s>
<s> neither of them thought but of <abvr> knightley and
themselves </s>
<s> 

harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad
to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and
such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give
the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight </s>
<s> emmas
tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than
harriets but they were not less </s>
<s>  her voice was not unsteady </s>
<s>  but her
mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such
a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing
emotions must create </s>
<s> she listened with much inward suffering but
with great outward patience to harriets detail </s>
<s> methodical or well
arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be </s>
<s>  but it
contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of
the narration a substance to sink her spiritespecially with the
corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys most improved opinion of harriet </s>
<s> 

harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances </s>
<s> emma knew that he had on that occasion
found her much superior to his expectation </s>
<s>  from that evening or at
least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her to think of him
harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he
had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner
towards her </s>
<s>  a manner of kindness and sweetness </s>
<s> latterly she had been
more and more aware of it </s>
<s>  when they had been all walking together
he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very
delightfully </s>
<s> he seemed to want to be acquainted with her </s>
<s>  emma knew it
to have been very much the case </s>
<s>  she had often observed the change to
almost the same extent </s>
<s> harriet repeated expressions of approbation
and praise from himand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement
with what she had known of his opinion of harriet </s>
<s>  he praised her for
being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous
feelings </s>
<s> she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet </s>
<s>  he
had dwelt on them to her more than once </s>
<s> much that lived in harriets
memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from
him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment
implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected
by emma </s>
<s>  circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed
undiscerned by her who now heard them </s>
<s>  but the two latest occurrences to
be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without
some degree of witness from emma herself </s>
<s> the first was his walking
with her apart from the others in the limewalk at donwell where they
had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as
she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first
he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done
before in a very particular way indeed </s>
<s> harriet could not recall
it without a blush </s>
<s>  he seemed to be almost asking her whether her
affections were engaged </s>
<s> but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared
likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about
farming </s>
<s> the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half
an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of
his being at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said that
he could not stay five minutesand his having told her during their
conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against
his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as
emma felt than he had acknowledged to her </s>
<s>  the superior degree of
confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her
severe pain </s>
<s> 

on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a
little reflection venture the following question </s>
<s>  might he not </s>
<s> is
not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of
your affections he might be alluding to <abvr> martinhe might have
mr </s>
<s>  martins interest in view </s>
<s>  but harriet rejected the suspicion with
spirit </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  martin </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s> there was not a hint of <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  i hope i
know better now than to care for <abvr> martin or to be suspected of it </s>
<s> 

when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss
woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope </s>
<s> 

i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but
for you </s>
<s>  you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour
be the rule of mineand so i have </s>
<s>  but now i seem to feel that i may
deserve him </s>
<s>  and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so
very wonderful </s>
<s> 

the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings
made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side to enable her to say
on reply

harriet i will only venture to declare that <abvr> knightley is the last
man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his
feeling for her more than he really does </s>
<s> 

harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so
satisfactory </s>
<s>  and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which
at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her
fathers footsteps </s>
<s>  he was coming through the hall </s>
<s>  harriet was too
much agitated to encounter him </s>
<s>  she could not compose herself
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better go </s>
<s> with most ready
encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another
doorand the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of
emmas feelings </s>
<s>  oh god </s>
<s>  that i had never seen her </s>
<s> 

the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her
thoughts </s>
<s> she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had
rushed on her within the last few hours </s>
<s>  every moment had brought a
fresh surprize </s>
<s>  and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to
her </s>
<s> how to understand it all </s>
<s>  how to understand the deceptions she had
been thus practising on herself and living under </s>
<s> the blunders the
blindness of her own head and heart </s>
<s> she sat still she walked about
she tried her own room she tried the shrubberyin every place every
posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly </s>
<s>  that she had
been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree </s>
<s>  that she had
been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying </s>
<s>  that she
was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of
wretchedness </s>
<s> 

to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first
endeavour </s>
<s>  to that point went every leisure moment which her fathers
claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind </s>
<s> 

how long had <abvr> knightley been so dear to her as every feeling
declared him now to be </s>
<s>  when had his influence such influence begun </s>
<s> 
when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank
churchill had once for a short period occupied </s>
<s> she looked back </s>
<s> 
she compared the twocompared them as they had always stood in her
estimation from the time of the latters becoming known to herand as
they must at any time have been compared by her had itoh </s>
<s>  had it by
any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison </s>
<s> she
saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider <abvr>
knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not
been infinitely the most dear </s>
<s>  she saw that in persuading herself
in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a
delusion totally ignorant of her own heartand in short that she had
never really cared for frank churchill at all </s>
<s> 

this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection </s>
<s>  this was
the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which
she reached </s>
<s>  and without being long in reaching it </s>
<s> she was most
sorrowfully indignant </s>
<s>  ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed
to herher affection for <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> every other part of her mind
was disgusting </s>
<s>

<s>  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every

<s>  she was proved to have been universally mistaken </s>

brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on <abvr>

mr </s>

too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him </s>

it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent

a little curiosity emma had </s>

of agitation herself </s>

to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and <abvr>
churchill could be reconciled to the engagements becoming known </s>

considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid
without leading to reports </s>

was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her
family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it </s>
<s> 
or if it were that it would be of any consequence </s>
<s>  for such things
 he observed always got about </s>
<s>  emma smiled and felt that <abvr> weston
had very good reason for saying so </s>
<s>  they had gone in shortand very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady </s>
<s>  she had
hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn
how deeply she was suffering from consciousness </s>
<s>  the quiet heartfelt
satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her
daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a
gratifying yet almost an affecting scene </s>
<s>  they were both so truly
respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation </s>
<s> 
thought so much of jane </s>
<s>  so much of every body and so little of
themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them </s>
<s>  miss
fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea for <abvr> weston to
invite her to an airing </s>
<s>  she had drawn back and declined at first but
on being pressed had yielded </s>
<s>  and in the course of their drive
mrs </s>
<s>  weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her
embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject </s>
<s> 
apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception
and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling
towards herself and <abvr> weston must necessarily open the cause </s>
<s>  but
when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the
present and of the future state of the engagement </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was
convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her
companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been
and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject </s>
<s> 

on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so
many months continued <abvr> weston she was energetic </s>
<s>  this was one
of her expressions </s>
<s>  ˜i will not say that since i entered into the
engagement i have not had some happy moments </s>
<s>  but i can say that i have
never known the blessing of one tranquil hour </s>
<s> and the quivering lip
emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart </s>
<s> 

poor girl </s>
<s>  said emma </s>
<s>  she thinks herself wrong then for having
consented to a private engagement </s>
<s> 

wrong </s>
<s>  no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed
to blame herself </s>
<s>  ˜the consequence said she ˜has been a state of
perpetual suffering to me </s>
<s>  and so it ought </s>
<s>  but after all the punishment
that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct </s>
<s>  pain is no
expiation </s>
<s>  i never can be blameless </s>
<s>  i have been acting contrary to all
my sense of right </s>
<s>  and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken
and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me
ought not to be </s>
<s>  ˜do not imagine madam she continued ˜that i was
taught wrong </s>
<s>  do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the
care of the friends who brought me up </s>
<s>  the error has been all my own </s>
<s> 
and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances
may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel
campbell </s>
<s> 

poor girl </s>
<s>  said emma again </s>
<s>  she loves him then excessively i
suppose </s>
<s>  it must have been from attachment only that she could be
led to form the engagement </s>
<s>  her affection must have overpowered her
judgment </s>
<s> 

yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him </s>
<s> 

i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have
contributed to make her unhappy </s>
<s> 

on your side my love it was very innocently done </s>
<s>  but she
probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the
misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before </s>
<s>  one natural
consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was
that of making her unreasonable </s>
<s>  the consciousness of having done
amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious
and irritable to a degree that must have beenthat had beenhard for
him to bear </s>
<s>  ˜i did not make the allowances said she ˜which i ought
to have done for his temper and spiritshis delightful spirits and
that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other
circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to
me as they were at first </s>
<s>  she then began to speak of you and of the
great kindness you had shewn her during her illness </s>
<s>  and with a blush
which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had
an opportunity to thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every
wish and every endeavour to do her good </s>
<s>  she was sensible that you had
never received any proper acknowledgment from herself </s>
<s> 

if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which
in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she
must be i could not bear these thanks </s>
<s> for oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston if there
were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss
fairfax </s>
<s> well checking herself and trying to be more lively this
is all to be forgotten </s>

very goodi hope she will be very happy </s>
<s>  it is fit that the fortune

<s> 

such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she thought
well of frank in almost every respect </s>
<s>  and what was more she loved him
very much and her defence was therefore earnest </s>

<s>  and when <abvr> weston ended

mrs </s>
<s>  westons communications furnished emma with more food for
unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her
sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax </s>
<s>  she bitterly regretted
not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the
envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause </s>
<s> 
had she followed <abvr> knightleys known wishes in paying that attention
to miss fairfax which was every way her due </s>
<s>  had she tried to know her
better </s>
<s>  had she done her part towards intimacy </s>
<s>  had she endeavoured
to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith </s>
<s>  she must in all
probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her
now </s>
<s> birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as
an associate for her to be received with gratitude </s>
<s>  and the otherwhat
was she </s>
<s> supposing even that they had never become intimate friends </s>
<s> 
that she had never been admitted into miss fairfaxs confidence on this
important matterwhich was most probablestill in knowing her as
she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the
abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to <abvr> dixon which she
had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so
unpardonably imparted </s>
<s>  an idea which she greatly feared had been made a
subject of material distress to the delicacy of janes feelings by the
levity or carelessness of frank churchills </s>
<s>  of all the sources of evil
surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded
that she must herself have been the worst </s>
<s>  she must have been a
perpetual enemy </s>
<s>  they never could have been all three together without
her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace in a thousand instances </s>
<s>  and on
box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no
more </s>
<s> 

the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield </s>
<s> 
the weather added what it could of gloom </s>
<s>  a cold stormy rain set in and
nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was
despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights
the longer visible </s>
<s> 

the weather affected <abvr> woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side and by
exertions which had never cost her half so much before </s>
<s>  it reminded
her of their first forlorn teteatete on the evening of <abvr> westons
weddingday </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley had walked in then soon after tea
and dissipated every melancholy fancy </s>
<s>  alas </s>
<s>  such delightful proofs of
hartfields attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly
be over </s>
<s>  the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the
approaching winter had proved erroneous </s>
<s>  no friends had deserted them
no pleasures had been lost </s>
<s> but her present forebodings she feared
would experience no similar contradiction </s>
<s>  the prospect before her now
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelledthat
might not be even partially brightened </s>
<s>  if all took place that
might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be
comparatively deserted </s>
<s>  and she left to cheer her father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness </s>
<s> 

the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than
herself </s>
<s>  and <abvr> westons heart and time would be occupied by it </s>
<s> 
they should lose her </s>
<s>  and probably in great measure her husband
also </s>
<s> frank churchill would return among them no more </s>
<s>  and miss
fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to
highbury </s>
<s>  they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe </s>
<s> 
all that were good would be withdrawn </s>
<s>  and if to these losses the
loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or
of rational society within their reach </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley to be no longer
coming there for his evening comfort </s>
<s> no longer walking in at all
hours as if ever willing to change his own home for theirs </s>
<s> how was
it to be endured </s>
<s>  and if he were to be lost to them for harriets sake </s>
<s> 
if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriets society
all that he wanted </s>
<s>  if harriet were to be the chosen the first
the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best
blessings of existence </s>
<s>  what could be increasing emmas wretchedness but
the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her
own work </s>
<s> 

when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from
a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a
few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better
conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might
be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it
would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and
leave her less to regret when it were gone </s>

chapter xiii


the weather continued much the same all the following morning </s>
<s>  and
the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at
hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared </s>
<s>  the wind changed into a
softer quarter </s>
<s>  the clouds were carried off </s>
<s>  the sun appeared </s>
<s>  it was
summer again </s>
<s>  with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma
resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible </s>
<s>  never had the exquisite
sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after
a storm been more attractive to her </s>
<s>  she longed for the serenity they
might gradually introduce </s>
<s>  and on <abvr> perrys coming in soon after
dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time
in hurrying into the shrubbery </s>
<s> there with spirits freshened and
thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw <abvr>
knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her </s>
<s> it
was the first intimation of his being returned from london </s>
<s>  she had
been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles
distant </s>
<s> there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind </s>
<s>  she
must be collected and calm </s>
<s>  in half a minute they were together </s>
<s>  the
how dye dos were quiet and constrained on each side </s>
<s>  she asked after
their mutual friends </s>
<s>  they were all well </s>
<s> when had he left them </s>
<s> only
that morning </s>
<s>  he must have had a wet ride </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> he meant to walk with
her she found </s>
<s>  he had just looked into the diningroom and as he was
not wanted there preferred being out of doors </s>
<s> she thought he neither
looked nor spoke cheerfully </s>
<s>  and the first possible cause for it
suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his
plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had
been received </s>
<s> 

they walked together </s>
<s>  he was silent </s>
<s>  she thought he was often looking
at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to
give </s>
<s>  and this belief produced another dread </s>
<s>  perhaps he wanted to
speak to her of his attachment to harriet </s>
<s>  he might be watching for
encouragement to begin </s>
<s> she did not could not feel equal to lead the
way to any such subject </s>
<s>  he must do it all himself </s>
<s>  yet she could
not bear this silence </s>
<s>  with him it was most unnatural </s>
<s>  she
consideredresolvedand trying to smile began

you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather
surprize you </s>
<s> 

have i </s>
<s>  said he quietly and looking at her </s>
<s>  of what nature </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  the best nature in the worlda wedding </s>
<s> 

after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he
replied

if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that
already </s>
<s> 

how is it possible </s>
<s>  cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards
him </s>
<s>  for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called
at <abvr> goddards in his way </s>
<s> 

i had a few lines on parish business from <abvr> weston this morning and
at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened </s>
<s> 

emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more
composure

you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have
had your suspicions </s>
<s> i have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution </s>
<s> i wish i had attended to itbutwith a sinking voice
and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness </s>
<s> 

for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having
excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within
his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone
of great sensibility speaking low

time my dearest emma time will heal the wound </s>
<s> your own excellent
senseyour exertions for your fathers sakei know you will not allow
yourself </s>
<s>  her arm was pressed again as he added in a more
broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest
friendshipindignationabominable scoundrel </s>
<s> and in a louder
steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone </s>
<s>  they will soon
be in yorkshire </s>
<s>  i am sorry for her </s>
<s>  she deserves a better fate </s>
<s> 

emma understood him </s>
<s>  and as soon as she could recover from the flutter
of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied

you are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right </s>
<s> 
i am not in want of that sort of compassion </s>
<s>  my blindness to what was
going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed
of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may
well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason

<s> 

emma </s>
<s>  cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed </s>
<s> but
checking himselfno no i understand youforgive mei am pleased
that you can say even so much </s>
<s> he is no object of regret indeed </s>
<s>  and

<s> fortunate that your affections were not
farther entangled </s>
<s> i could never i confess from your manners assure
myself as to the degree of what you felti could only be certain that

error </s>
<s>  and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i

<s> 

he listened in perfect silence </s>
<s>  she wished him to speak but he would
not </s>
<s>  she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his
clemency </s>
<s>  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in
his opinion </s>
<s>  she went on however </s>

<s> i was tempted by his
attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased </s>
<s> an old story

<s>  and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up
as i do for understanding </s>
<s>  many circumstances assisted the temptation </s>
<s> 
he was the son of <abvr> westonhe was continually herei always found
him very pleasantand in short for with a sigh let me swell out the
causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at lastmy vanity
was flattered and i allowed his attentions </s>
<s>  latterly howeverfor some
time indeedi have had no idea of their meaning any thing </s>

them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side </s>

he has imposed on me but he has not injured me </s>
<s>  i have never been

<s>  he
never wished to attach me </s>
<s>  it was merely a blind to conceal his real
situation with another </s>

no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myselfexcept
that i was not blindedthat it was my good fortunethat in short i
was somehow or other safe from him </s>
<s> 

she had hoped for an answer herefor a few words to say that her
conduct was at least intelligible </s>
<s>  but he was silent </s>
<s>  and as far as she
could judge deep in thought </s>
<s>  at last and tolerably in his usual tone
he said

i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill </s>
<s> i can suppose
however that i may have underrated him </s>
<s>  my acquaintance with him has
been but trifling </s>

while he spoke emmas mind was most busy and with all the wonderful

with contrition </s>

judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever

chapter xiv


what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from
what she had brought out </s>
<s> she had then been only daring to hope for
a little respite of suffering </s>
<s> she was now in an exquisite flutter of
happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be
greater when the flutter should have passed away </s>
<s> 

they sat down to teathe same party round the same tablehow often
it had been collected </s>
<s> and how often had her eyes fallen on the same
shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the
western sun </s>
<s> but never in such a state of spirits never in any thing
like it </s>
<s>  and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her
usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive
daughter </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the
breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously
hoping might not have taken cold from his ride </s>
<s> could he have seen the
heart he would have cared very little for the lungs </s>
<s>  but without the
most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest
perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either
he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had
received from <abvr> perry and talked on with much selfcontentment
totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return </s>
<s> 

as long as <abvr> knightley remained with them emmas fever continued </s>
<s> 
but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and
subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax
for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points
to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some
alloy </s>
<s>  her fatherand harriet </s>
<s>  she could not be alone without feeling
the full weight of their separate claims </s>
<s>  and how to guard the comfort
of both to the utmost was the question </s>
<s>  with respect to her father
it was a question soon answered </s>
<s>  she hardly knew yet what <abvr> knightley
would ask </s>
<s>  but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most
solemn resolution of never quitting her father </s>
<s> she even wept over
the idea of it as a sin of thought </s>
<s>  while he lived it must be only an
engagement </s>
<s>  but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of
drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him </s>
<s> how
to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision </s>
<s> how to spare
her from any unnecessary pain </s>
<s>  how to make her any possible atonement </s>
<s> 
how to appear least her enemy </s>
<s> on these subjects her perplexity
and distress were very greatand her mind had to pass again and
again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever
surrounded it </s>
<s> she could only resolve at last that she would still
avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by
letter </s>
<s>  that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed
just now for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme
morenearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her to brunswick square </s>
<s> isabella had been pleased with harriet </s>
<s> 
and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement </s>
<s> she did
not think it in harriets nature to escape being benefited by novelty
and variety by the streets the shops and the children </s>
<s> at any rate
it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom
every thing was due </s>
<s>  a separation for the present </s>
<s>  an averting of the
evil day when they must all be together again </s>
<s> 

she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet </s>
<s>  an employment which
left her so very serious so nearly sad that <abvr> knightley in walking
up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon </s>
<s>  and half
an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him
literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a
proper share of the happiness of the evening before </s>
<s> 

he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the
slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was
brought her from randallsa very thick letter </s>
<s> she guessed what it
must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it </s>
<s> she was now
in perfect charity with frank churchill </s>
<s>  she wanted no explanations she
wanted only to have her thoughts to herselfand as for understanding
any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it </s>

my dear madam

if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be
expected </s>
<s>  but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and
indulgence </s>
<s> you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of
even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct </s>
<s> but
i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent </s>
<s>  my courage
rises while i write </s>
<s>  it is very difficult for the prosperous to be
humble </s>
<s>  i have already met with such success in two applications for
pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours
and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence </s>
<s> you
must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i
first arrived at randalls </s>
<s>  you must consider me as having a secret which
was to be kept at all hazards </s>
<s>  this was the fact </s>
<s>  my right to place
myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question </s>
<s> 
i shall not discuss it here </s>
<s>  for my temptation to think it a right
i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and
casements above in highbury </s>
<s>  i dared not address her openly </s>
<s>  my
difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to
require definition </s>
<s>  and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we
parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the
creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement </s>
<s> had she refused i
should have gone mad </s>
<s> but you will be ready to say what was your
hope in doing this </s>
<s> what did you look forward to </s>
<s> to any thing every
thingto time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts
perseverance and weariness health and sickness </s>
<s>  every possibility of
good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her
promises of faith and correspondence </s>
<s>  if you need farther explanation
i have the honour my dear madam of being your husbands son and
the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no
inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of </s>
<s> see
me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to
randalls </s>
<s> and here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have
been sooner paid </s>
<s>  you will look back and see that i did not come till
miss fairfax was in highbury </s>
<s>  and as you were the person slighted you
will forgive me instantly </s>
<s>  but i must work on my fathers compassion by
reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long
i lost the blessing of knowing you </s>
<s>  my behaviour during the very
happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to
reprehension excepting on one point </s>
<s>  and now i come to the principal
the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which
excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation </s>
<s>  with
the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss
woodhouse </s>
<s>  my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest
humiliation </s>
<s> a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his
opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to </s>
<s> my behaviour
to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought </s>
<s> in order to
assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than
an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately
thrown </s>
<s> i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible objectbut
i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been
convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any
selfish views to go on </s>
<s> amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is
she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached </s>
<s>  and
that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me
was as much my conviction as my wish </s>
<s> she received my attentions with
an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me </s>
<s> 
we seemed to understand each other </s>
<s>  from our relative situation those
attentions were her due and were felt to be so </s>
<s> whether miss woodhouse
began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight
i cannot say </s>
<s> when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was
within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not
without suspicion </s>
<s>  but i have no doubt of her having since detected me
at least in some degree </s>
<s> she may not have surmised the whole but her
quickness must have penetrated a part </s>
<s>  i cannot doubt it </s>
<s>  you will find
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it
did not take her wholly by surprize </s>
<s>  she frequently gave me hints of it </s>
<s> 
i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed <abvr> elton gratitude
for her attentions to miss fairfax </s>
<s> i hope this history of my conduct
towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation
of what you saw amiss </s>
<s>  while you considered me as having sinned against
emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either </s>
<s>  acquit me here and
procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes
of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly
affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as
myself </s>
<s> whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight
you have now a key to </s>
<s>  my heart was in highbury and my business was to
get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion </s>
<s> 
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account </s>
<s> of
the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that
its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never
have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her </s>
<s> the
delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam
is much beyond my power of doing justice to </s>
<s>  you will soon i earnestly
hope know her thoroughly yourself </s>
<s> no description can describe her </s>
<s> 
she must tell you herself what she isyet not by word for never
was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own
merit </s>
<s> since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw
i have heard from her </s>
<s> she gives a good account of her own health </s>
<s>  but
as she never complains i dare not depend </s>
<s>  i want to have your opinion
of her looks </s>
<s>  i know you will soon call on her </s>
<s>  she is living in dread
of the visit </s>
<s>  perhaps it is paid already </s>
<s>  let me hear from you without
delay </s>
<s>  i am impatient for a thousand particulars </s>
<s>  remember how few
minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state </s>
<s>  and
i am not much better yet </s>
<s>  still insane either from happiness or
misery </s>
<s>  when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her
excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad with joy </s>
<s> 
but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little
i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger </s>
<s>  if i could but see her
again </s>
<s> but i must not propose it yet </s>
<s>  my uncle has been too good for me
to encroach </s>
<s> i must still add to this long letter </s>
<s>  you have not heard
all that you ought to hear </s>
<s>  i could not give any connected detail
yesterday </s>
<s>  but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness
with which the affair burst out needs explanation </s>
<s>  for though the event
of the th ult </s>
<s>  as you will conclude immediately opened to me the
happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures
but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to
lose </s>
<s>  i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she
would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and
refinement </s>
<s> but i had no choice </s>
<s>  the hasty engagement she had entered
into with that womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off
abruptly to recollect and compose myself </s>
<s> i have been walking over
the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of
my letter what it ought to be </s>
<s> it is in fact a most mortifying
retrospect for me </s>
<s>  i behaved shamefully </s>
<s>  and here i can admit that
my manners to miss w </s>
<s>  in being unpleasant to miss f </s>
<s>  were highly
blameable </s>
<s>  she disapproved them which ought to have been enough </s>
<s> my
plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient </s>
<s> she was
displeased </s>
<s>  i thought unreasonably so </s>
<s>  i thought her on a thousand
occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious </s>
<s>  i thought her even
cold </s>
<s>  but she was always right </s>
<s>  if i had followed her judgment and
subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known </s>
<s> we quarrelled </s>
<s> 
do you remember the morning spent at donwell </s>
<s> there every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis </s>
<s>  i was late </s>
<s> 
i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she
would not suffer it </s>
<s>  she absolutely refused to allow me which i then
thought most unreasonable </s>
<s>  now however i see nothing in it but a very
natural and consistent degree of discretion </s>
<s>  while i to blind the
world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable
particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a
proposal which might have made every previous caution useless </s>
<s> had we
been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must
have been suspected </s>
<s> i was mad enough however to resent </s>
<s> i doubted
her affection </s>
<s>  i doubted it more the next day on box hill </s>
<s>  when
provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect
of her and such apparent devotion to miss w </s>
<s>  as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in
a form of words perfectly intelligible to me </s>
<s> in short my dear
madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine </s>
<s>  and
i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with
you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with
her as possible </s>
<s>  even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to
be reconciled in time </s>
<s>  but i was the injured person injured by her
coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first
advances </s>
<s> i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of
the box hill party </s>
<s>  had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly
suppose you would ever have thought well of me again </s>
<s>  its effect upon
her appears in the immediate resolution it produced </s>
<s>  as soon as she
found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that
officious <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the whole system of whose treatment of her by the
bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred </s>
<s>  i must not quarrel
with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards
myself </s>
<s>  but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it
which that woman has known </s>
<s> ˜jane indeed </s>
<s> you will observe that i
have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you </s>
<s> 
think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between
the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the
insolence of imaginary superiority </s>
<s>  have patience with me i shall soon
have done </s>
<s> she closed with this offer resolving to break with me
entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet
again </s>
<s> she felt the engagement to be a source of
repentance and misery to each </s>
<s>  she dissolved it </s>
<s> this
letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunts death </s>
<s>  i
answered it within an hour </s>
<s>  but from the confusion of my mind and the
multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of
being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in
my writingdesk </s>
<s>  and i trusting that i had written enough though but
a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness </s>
<s> i was
rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily </s>
<s>  but i
made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i add </s>
<s> too cheerful
in my views to be captious </s>
<s> we removed to windsor </s>
<s>  and two
days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all
returned </s>
<s> and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her
extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last </s>
<s>  and
adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued
and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate
arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe
conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly
command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would
forward them after that period to her at </s>
<s>  in short the full direction
to <abvr> smallridges near bristol stared me in the face </s>
<s>  i knew the
name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had
been doing </s>
<s>  it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which i knew her to possess </s>
<s>  and the secrecy she had maintained as to
any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its
anxious delicacy </s>
<s>  for the world would not she have seemed to threaten
me </s>

own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post </s>

could not hope to be listened to again </s>

earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying </s>
<s> 
and could say at last poor man </s>
<s>  with a deep sigh that he wished i
might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done </s>
<s> i
felt that it would be of a different sort </s>
<s> are you disposed to pity
me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my
suspense while all was at stake </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  do not pity me till i reached
highbury and saw how ill i had made her </s>
<s>  do not pity me till i saw her
wan sick looks </s>
<s> i reached highbury at the time of day when from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance
of finding her alone </s>
<s> i was not disappointed </s>

disappointed either in the object of my journey </s>

reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away </s>

done </s>

release you </s>

it was irresistible </s>

have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever </s>

she thought so well of the letter that when <abvr> knightley came again
she desired him to read it </s>
<s>  she was sure of <abvr> westons wishing it to
be communicated </s>
<s>  especially to one who like <abvr> knightley had seen so
much to blame in his conduct </s>
<s> 

i shall be very glad to look it over said he </s>

will take it home with me at night </s>

but that would not do </s>

must return it by him </s>
<s> 

i would rather be talking to you he replied </s>

<s> 

he beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered
the sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few
months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference </s>

he proceeded a little farther reading to himself </s>

way </s>

it will not be so great a loss of time </s>

mr </s>
<s>  knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity </s>
<s> 

he trifles here said he as to the temptation </s>
<s>  he knows he is wrong
and has nothing rational to urge </s>
<s> bad </s>
<s> he ought not to have formed the
engagement </s>
<s> ˜his fathers disposition </s>
<s> he is unjust however to his
father </s>
<s>  <abvr> westons sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright
and honourable exertions </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston earned every present comfort
before he endeavoured to gain it </s>
<s> very true </s>

fairfax was here </s>

were perfectly right </s>
<s> 

i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma </s>

when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it
aloudall that related to her with a smile </s>
<s>  a look </s>
<s>  a shake of the
head </s>
<s>  a word or two of assent or disapprobation </s>

<s>  my emma does not every thing serve to prove more

<s> 

emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriets account
which she could not give any sincere explanation of </s>
<s> 

you had better go on said she </s>
<s> 

he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  that
was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether
the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure </s>
<s>  a
boyish scheme indeed </s>
<s> i cannot comprehend a mans wishing to give a
woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense
with </s>
<s>  and he did know that she would have prevented the instruments
coming if she could </s>
<s> 

after this he made some progress without any pause </s>
<s>  frank churchills
confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for
more than a word in passing </s>
<s> 

i perfectly agree with you sirwas then his remark </s>
<s>  you did behave
very shamefully </s>
<s>  you never wrote a truer line </s>
<s>  and having gone through
what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his
persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxs sense of right
he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad </s>
<s> he had induced her
to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and
uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from
suffering unnecessarily </s>
<s> she must have had much more to contend
with in carrying on the correspondence than he could </s>
<s>  he should have
respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such </s>
<s>  but hers were
all reasonable </s>
<s>  we must look to her one fault and remember that she
had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she
should have been in such a state of punishment </s>
<s> 

emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew
uncomfortable </s>
<s>  her own behaviour had been so very improper </s>
<s>  she was
deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look </s>
<s>  it was all read
however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark </s>
<s>  and
excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear
of giving painno remembrance of box hill seemed to exist </s>
<s> 

there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the
eltons was his next observation </s>
<s> his feelings are natural </s>

<s>

<s> she felt the engagement to
be a source of repentance and misery to eachshe dissolved it </s>
<s> what a
view this gives of her sense of his behaviour </s>

extraordinary

<s> 

i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him </s>
<s> 

well there is feeling here </s>
<s> he does seem to have suffered in
finding her ill </s>
<s> certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of
her </s>
<s>  ˜dearer much dearer than ever </s>
<s>  i hope he may long continue to
feel all the value of such a reconciliation </s>
<s> he is a very liberal
thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands </s>
<s> ˜happier than i
deserve </s>
<s>  come he knows himself there </s>
<s>  ˜miss woodhouse calls me the
child of good fortune </s>
<s> those were miss woodhouses words were they </s>
<s> 
and a fine endingand there is the letter </s>
<s>  the child of good fortune </s>
<s> 
that was your name for him was it </s>
<s> 

you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am </s>
<s>  but still
you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it </s>
<s>  i
hope it does him some service with you </s>
<s> 

yes certainly it does </s>
<s>  he has had great faults faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness </s>
<s>  and i am very much of his opinion
in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves </s>
<s>  but still as he
is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it
may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very
ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the
steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants </s>
<s>  and now let me talk
to you of something else </s>
<s>  i have another persons interest at present
so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill </s>
<s> 
ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work
on one subject </s>
<s> 

the subject followed </s>
<s>  it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike
english such as <abvr> knightley used even to the woman he was in love
with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the
happiness of her father </s>
<s>  emmas answer was ready at the first word </s>
<s> 
while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible
for her </s>
<s>  she could never quit him </s>
<s>  part only of this answer however
was admitted </s>
<s>  the impossibility of her quitting her father <abvr>
knightley felt as strongly as herself </s>
<s>  but the inadmissibility of any
other change he could not agree to </s>
<s>  he had been thinking it over most
deeply most intently </s>
<s>  he had at first hoped to induce <abvr> woodhouse to
remove with her to donwell </s>
<s>  he had wanted to believe it feasible but
his knowledge of <abvr> woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself
long </s>
<s>  and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation
would be a risk of her fathers comfort perhaps even of his life which
must not be hazarded </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse taken from hartfield </s>
<s> no he felt
that it ought not to be attempted </s>
<s>  but the plan which had arisen on the
sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any
respect objectionable </s>
<s>  it was that he should be received at hartfield </s>
<s> 
that so long as her fathers happinessin other words his liferequired
hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise </s>
<s> 

of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing
thoughts </s>
<s>  like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it </s>
<s>  but such
an alternative as this had not occurred to her </s>
<s>  she was sensible of all
the affection it evinced </s>
<s>  she felt that in quitting donwell he must
be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits </s>
<s>  that
in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there
would be much very much to be borne with </s>
<s>  she promised to think of it
and advised him to think of it more </s>
<s>  but he was fully convinced that no
reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject </s>
<s>  he had
given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration </s>
<s>  he had
been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his
thoughts to himself </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma </s>
<s>  i am sure
william larkins will not like it </s>
<s>  you must get his consent before you
ask mine </s>
<s> 

she promised however to think of it </s>
<s>  and pretty nearly promised
moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good
scheme </s>
<s> 

it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in
which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as
heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded </s>
<s>  think she must
of the possible difference to the poor little boy </s>
<s>  and yet she only
gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in
detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of <abvr> knightleys
marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had
wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt </s>
<s> 

this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at
hartfieldthe more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became </s>
<s> 
his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual
good to outweigh every drawback </s>
<s>  such a companion for herself in the
periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her </s>
<s> such a partner in
all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of
melancholy </s>
<s> 

she would have been too happy but for poor harriet </s>
<s>  but every blessing
of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend
who must now be even excluded from hartfield </s>
<s>  the delightful family
party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere
charitable caution be kept at a distance from </s>
<s>  she would be a loser in
every way </s>
<s>  emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction
from her own enjoyment </s>
<s>  in such a party harriet would be rather a
dead weight than otherwise </s>
<s>  but for the poor girl herself it seemed a
peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of
unmerited punishment </s>
<s> 

in time of course <abvr> knightley would be forgotten that is
supplanted </s>
<s>  but this could not be expected to happen very early </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure </s>
<s> not
like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley always so kind so feeling so truly
considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped
than now </s>
<s>  and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she
could be in love with more than three men in one year </s>
<s> 



chapter xvi


it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as
herself to avoid a meeting </s>
<s>  their intercourse was painful enough by
letter </s>
<s>  how much worse had they been obliged to meet </s>
<s> 

harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without
reproaches or apparent sense of illusage </s>
<s>  and yet emma fancied there
was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style
which increased the desirableness of their being separate </s>
<s> it might be
only her own consciousness </s>
<s>  but it seemed as if an angel only could have
been quite without resentment under such a stroke </s>
<s> 

she had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation </s>
<s>  and she was
fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting
to invention </s>
<s> there was a tooth amiss </s>
<s>  harriet really wished and
had wished some time to consult a dentist </s>
<s>  <abvr> john knightley was
delighted to be of use </s>
<s>  any thing of ill health was a recommendation to
herand though not so fond of a dentist as of a <abvr> wingfield she was
quite eager to have harriet under her care </s>
<s> when it was thus settled
on her sisters side emma proposed it to her friend and found her
very persuadable </s>
<s> harriet was to go </s>
<s>  she was invited for at least a
fortnight </s>
<s>  she was to be conveyed in <abvr> woodhouses carriage </s>
<s> it was
all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick
square </s>
<s> 

now emma could indeed enjoy <abvr> knightleys visits </s>
<s>  now she could
talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense
of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her
when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might
at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings
which she had led astray herself </s>
<s> 

the difference of harriet at <abvr> goddards or in london made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in emmas sensations </s>
<s>  but she could not think
of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must
be averting the past and carrying her out of herself </s>
<s> 

she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which harriet had occupied </s>
<s>  there was a communication before
her one which she only could be competent to makethe confession of
her engagement to her father </s>
<s>  but she would have nothing to do with it
at present </s>
<s> she had resolved to defer the disclosure till <abvr> weston
were safe and well </s>
<s>  no additional agitation should be thrown at this
period among those she lovedand the evil should not act on herself
by anticipation before the appointed time </s>
<s> a fortnight at least of
leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating
delight should be hers </s>
<s> 

she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an
hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax </s>
<s> she ought
to goand she was longing to see her </s>
<s>  the resemblance of their present
situations increasing every other motive of goodwill </s>
<s>  it would be a
secret satisfaction </s>
<s>  but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect
would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any
thing jane might communicate </s>
<s> 

she wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not
been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had
been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the
worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected </s>
<s> the fear of being still
unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to
wait in the passage and send up her name </s>
<s> she heard patty announcing
it </s>
<s>  but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so
happily intelligible </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  she heard nothing but the instant reply of
beg her to walk up </s>
<s> and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs
by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her
were felt sufficient </s>
<s> emma had never seen her look so well so lovely
so engaging </s>
<s>  there was consciousness animation and warmth </s>
<s>  there was
every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted </s>
<s> 
she came forward with an offered hand </s>
<s>  and said in a low but very
feeling tone

this is most kind indeed </s>
<s> miss woodhouse it is impossible for me
to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being so entirely
without words </s>
<s> 

emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the
sound of <abvr> eltons voice from the sittingroom had not checked
her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her
congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates and <abvr> elton were together </s>
<s>  miss bates was out which
accounted for the previous tranquillity </s>
<s>  emma could have wished <abvr>
elton elsewhere </s>
<s>  but she was in a humour to have patience with every
body </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the
rencontre would do them no harm </s>
<s> 

she soon believed herself to penetrate <abvr> eltons thoughts and
understand why she was like herself in happy spirits </s>
<s>  it was being in
miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was
still a secret to other people </s>
<s>  emma saw symptoms of it immediately in
the expression of her face </s>
<s>  and while paying her own compliments to <abvr>
bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladys replies she saw
her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she
had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into
the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods

we can finish this some other time you know </s>
<s>  you and i shall not want
opportunities </s>
<s>  and in fact you have heard all the essential already </s>
<s>  i
only wanted to prove to you that <abvr> s </s>
<s>  admits our apology and is
not offended </s>
<s>  you see how delightfully she writes </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she is a sweet
creature </s>
<s>  you would have doated on her had you gone </s>
<s> but not a word
more </s>
<s>  let us be discreetquite on our good behaviour </s>
<s> hush </s>
<s> you
remember those linesi forget the poem at this moment </s>
<s> 

        for when a ladys in the case
        you know all other things give place </s>
<s> 

now i say my dear in our case for lady readmum </s>
<s>  a word to
the wise </s>
<s> i am in a fine flow of spirits ant i </s>
<s>  but i want to set
your heart at ease as to <abvr> s </s>
<s> my representation you see has
quite appeased her </s>
<s> 

and again on emmas merely turning her head to look at <abvr> batess
knitting she added in a half whisper

i mentioned no names you will observe </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  cautious as a
minister of state </s>
<s>  i managed it extremely well </s>
<s> 

emma could not doubt </s>
<s>  it was a palpable display repeated on every
possible occasion </s>
<s>  when they had all talked a little while in harmony of
the weather and <abvr> weston she found herself abruptly addressed with

do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered </s>
<s> do not you think her cure does perry the highest
credit </s>
<s> here was a sideglance of great meaning at jane </s>
<s>  upon my
word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  if you had
seen her as i did when she was at the worst </s>
<s> and when <abvr> bates
was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word
of any assistance that perry might have </s>
<s>  not a word of a certain young
physician from windsor </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  perry shall have all the credit </s>
<s> 

i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she
shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill </s>
<s>  very pleasant
party </s>
<s>  but yet i think there was something wanting </s>
<s>  things did not
seemthat is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some </s>
<s> so
it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken </s>
<s>  however i think
it answered so far as to tempt one to go again </s>
<s>  what say you both to our
collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the
fine weather lasts </s>
<s> it must be the same party you know quite the
same party not one exception </s>
<s> 

soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being
diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting
she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say
every thing </s>
<s> 

thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness </s>
<s> it is impossible
to sayyes indeed i quite understanddearest janes prospectsthat

<s> but she is charmingly recovered </s>

circle as you find us here </s>
<s> yes indeed </s>

<s> that
isso very friendly </s>
<s>  i mean good <abvr> perry </s>
<s> such attention to
jane </s>
<s> and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight
towards <abvr> elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a
little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter
which was now graciously overcome </s>
<s> after a few whispers indeed which
placed it beyond a guess <abvr> elton speaking louder said

yes here i am my good friend </s>
<s>  and here i have been so long that
anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise </s>
<s>  but the truth
is that i am waiting for my lord and master </s>
<s>  he promised to join me
here and pay his respects to you </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  are we to have the pleasure of a call from <abvr> elton </s>
<s> that will
be a favour indeed </s>
<s>  for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and
mr </s>
<s>  eltons time is so engaged </s>
<s> 

upon my word it is miss bates </s>
<s> he really is engaged from morning to
night </s>
<s> there is no end of peoples coming to him on some pretence or
other </s>
<s> the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always
wanting his opinion </s>
<s>  they seem not able to do any thing without
him </s>
<s> ˜upon my word <abvr> e </s>
<s>  i often say ˜rather you than i </s>
<s> i do
not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had
half so many applicants </s>
<s> bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect
them both to an unpardonable degree </s>
<s> i believe i have not played a bar
this fortnight </s>
<s> however he is coming i assure you </s>
<s>  yes indeed on
purpose to wait on you all </s>
<s>  and putting up her hand to screen her
words from emmaa congratulatory visit you know </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yes quite
indispensable </s>
<s> 

miss bates looked about her so happily </s>
<s> 

he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from knightley </s>
<s>  but he and knightley are shut up together in deep
consultation </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  e </s>
<s>  is knightleys right hand </s>
<s> 

emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is <abvr> elton
gone on foot to donwell </s>
<s> he will have a hot walk </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting </s>
<s>  weston and
cole will be there too </s>
<s>  but one is apt to speak only of those who
lead </s>
<s> i fancy <abvr> e </s>
<s>  and knightley have every thing their own way </s>
<s> 

have not you mistaken the day </s>
<s>  said emma </s>
<s>  i am almost certain that
the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrow </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightley was at
hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer which
denoted the impossibility of any blunder on <abvr> eltons side </s>
<s> i do
believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever
was </s>
<s>  we never heard of such things at maple grove </s>
<s> 

your parish there was small said jane </s>
<s> 

upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject
talked of </s>
<s> 

but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard
you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and <abvr> bragge </s>
<s>  the
only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you clever creature thats very true </s>
<s>  what a thinking brain you
have </s>
<s>  i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we
could be shaken together </s>
<s>  my liveliness and your solidity would produce
perfection </s>
<s> not that i presume to insinuate however that some
people may not think you perfection already </s>
<s> but hush </s>
<s> not a word
if you please </s>
<s> 

it seemed an unnecessary caution </s>
<s>  jane was wanting to give her words
not to <abvr> elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw </s>
<s> 
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very
evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton made his appearance </s>
<s>  his lady greeted him with some of her
sparkling vivacity </s>
<s> 

very pretty sir upon my word </s>
<s>  to send me on here to be an
encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come </s>
<s> but
you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with </s>
<s>  you knew i should
not stir till my lord and master appeared </s>
<s> here have i been sitting
this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal
obediencefor who can say you know how soon it may be wanted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away </s>
<s> 
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid </s>
<s>  but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the
walk he had had for nothing </s>
<s> 

when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found </s>
<s>  very
odd </s>
<s>  very unaccountable </s>
<s>  after the note i sent him this morning and the
message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one </s>
<s> 

donwell </s>
<s>  cried his wife </s>
<s> my dear <abvr> e </s>
<s>  you have not been to
donwell </s>
<s> you mean the crown </s>
<s>  you come from the meeting at the crown </s>
<s> 

no no thats tomorrow </s>
<s>  and i particularly wanted to see knightley
today on that very account </s>
<s> such a dreadful broiling morning </s>
<s> i went
over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage which made
it so much the worse </s>
<s>  and then not to find him at home </s>
<s>  i assure you
i am not at all pleased </s>
<s>  and no apology left no message for me </s>
<s>  the
housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected </s>
<s> very
extraordinary </s>
<s> and nobody knew at all which way he was gone </s>
<s>  perhaps
to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods </s>
<s> miss
woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley </s>
<s> can you explain it </s>
<s> 

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary
indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him </s>

chapter xvii


mrs </s>
<s>  westons friends were all made happy by her safety </s>
<s>  and if the
satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to emma it was by
knowing her to be the mother of a little girl </s>
<s>  she had been decided in
wishing for a miss weston </s>
<s>  she would not acknowledge that it was with
any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabellas
sons </s>
<s>  but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father
and mother best </s>
<s>  it would be a great comfort to <abvr> weston as he grew
olderand even <abvr> weston might be growing older ten years henceto
have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home </s>
<s>  and <abvr> westonno
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her </s>
<s>  and it would be
quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have
their powers in exercise again </s>
<s> 

she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she
continuedlike la baronne dalmane on la comtesse dostalis in madame
de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little
adelaide educated on a more perfect plan </s>
<s> 

that is replied <abvr> knightley she will indulge her even more than
she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all </s>
<s>  it will
be the only difference </s>
<s> 

poor child </s>
<s>  cried emma </s>
<s>  at that rate what will become of her </s>
<s> 

nothing very bad </s>
<s> the fate of thousands </s>
<s>  she will be disagreeable
in infancy and correct herself as she grows older </s>
<s>  i am losing all my
bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma </s>
<s>  i who am owing all
my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be
severe on them </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and replied </s>
<s>  but i had the assistance of all your
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people </s>
<s>  i doubt whether
my own sense would have corrected me without it </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s> i have no doubt </s>
<s>  nature gave you understanding </s>
<s> miss taylor
gave you principles </s>
<s>  you must have done well </s>
<s>  my interference was quite
as likely to do harm as good </s>
<s>  it was very natural for you to say what
right has he to lecture me </s>
<s> and i am afraid very natural for you to
feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner </s>
<s>  i do not believe i did
you any good </s>
<s>  the good was all to myself by making you an object of the
tenderest affection to me </s>
<s>  i could not think about you so much without
doating on you faults and all </s>
<s>  and by dint of fancying so many errors
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least </s>
<s> 

i am sure you were of use to me cried emma </s>
<s>  i was very often
influenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time </s>
<s>  i
am very sure you did me good </s>
<s>  and if poor little anna weston is to be
spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her
as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is
thirteen </s>
<s> 

how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your
saucy looks˜mr </s>
<s>  knightley i am going to do soandso </s>
<s>  papa says i
may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which you knew i
did not approve </s>
<s>  in such cases my interference was giving you two bad
feelings instead of one </s>
<s> 

what an amiable creature i was </s>
<s> no wonder you should hold my speeches
in such affectionate remembrance </s>
<s> 

˜mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> you always called me ˜mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  and from
habit it has not so very formal a sound </s>
<s> and yet it is formal </s>
<s>  i want
you to call me something else but i do not know what </s>
<s> 

i remember once calling you ˜george in one of my amiable fits about
ten years ago </s>
<s>  i did it because i thought it would offend you </s>
<s>  but as
you made no objection i never did it again </s>
<s> 

and cannot you call me ˜george now </s>
<s> 

impossible </s>
<s> i never can call you any thing but ˜mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  i
will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of <abvr> elton by
calling you <abvr> k </s>
<s> but i will promise she added presently laughing
and blushingi will promise to call you once by your christian name </s>
<s> 
i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where </s>
<s> in the building in
which n </s>
<s>  takes m </s>
<s>  for better for worse </s>
<s> 

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important
service which his better sense would have rendered her to the
advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly
folliesher wilful intimacy with harriet smith </s>
<s>  but it was too tender a
subject </s>
<s> she could not enter on it </s>
<s> harriet was very seldom mentioned
between them </s>
<s>  this on his side might merely proceed from her not being
thought of </s>
<s>  but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy
and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were
declining </s>
<s>  she was aware herself that parting under any other
circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that
her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on
isabellas letters </s>
<s>  he might observe that it was so </s>
<s>  the pain of being
obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to
the pain of having made harriet unhappy </s>
<s> 

isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be
expected </s>
<s>  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which
appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted </s>
<s>  but
since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet
different from what she had known her before </s>
<s> isabella to be sure
was no very quick observer </s>
<s>  yet if harriet had not been equal to playing
with the children it would not have escaped her </s>
<s>  emmas comforts and
hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriets being to stay longer </s>
<s> 
her fortnight was likely to be a month at least </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> john
knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain
till they could bring her back </s>
<s> 

john does not even mention your friend said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  here is
his answer if you like to see it </s>
<s> 

it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage </s>
<s>  emma
accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know
what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her
friend was unmentioned </s>
<s> 

john enters like a brother into my happiness continued <abvr> knightley
but he is no complimenter </s>
<s>  and though i well know him to have
likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making
flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in
her praise </s>
<s>  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes </s>
<s> 

he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the
letter </s>
<s>  i honour his sincerity </s>
<s>  it is very plain that he considers the
good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not
without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as
you think me already </s>
<s>  had he said any thing to bear a different
construction i should not have believed him </s>
<s> 

my emma he means no such thing </s>
<s>  he only means

he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two
 interrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps than
he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the
subject </s>
<s> 

emma my dear emma

oh </s>
<s>  she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother
does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret
and hear his opinion </s>
<s>  depend upon it he will be much farther from doing
you justice </s>
<s>  he will think all the happiness all the advantage on
your side of the question </s>
<s>  all the merit on mine </s>
<s>  i wish i may not
sink into ˜poor emma with him at once </s>
<s> his tender compassion towards
oppressed worth can go no farther </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as
john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be
happy together </s>
<s>  i am amused by one part of johns letterdid you notice
it </s>
<s> where he says that my information did not take him wholly by
surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the
kind </s>
<s> 

if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying </s>
<s>  he had no idea of me </s>
<s>  he seems perfectly
unprepared for that </s>
<s> 

yes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into my
feelings </s>
<s>  what has he been judging by </s>
<s> i am not conscious of any
difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at
this time for my marrying any more than at another </s>
<s> but it was so i
suppose </s>
<s>  i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them
the other day </s>
<s>  i believe i did not play with the children quite so much
as usual </s>
<s>  i remember one evening the poor boys saying ˜uncle seems
always tired now </s>
<s> 

the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other
persons reception of it tried </s>
<s>  as soon as <abvr> weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit <abvr> woodhouses visits emma having it in view that
her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to
announce it at home and then at randalls </s>
<s> but how to break it to her
father at last </s>
<s> she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of <abvr>
knightleys absence or when it came to the point her heart would have
failed her and she must have put it off </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley was to come
at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make </s>
<s> she was
forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too </s>
<s>  she must not make it a
more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself </s>
<s> 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune </s>
<s> with all the spirits she
could command she prepared him first for something strange and then
in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be
obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with no difficulty
since it was a plan to promote the happiness of allshe and <abvr>
knightley meant to marry </s>
<s>  by which means hartfield would receive the
constant addition of that persons company whom she knew he loved next
to his daughters and <abvr> weston best in the world </s>
<s> 

poor man </s>
<s> it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried
earnestly to dissuade her from it </s>
<s>  she was reminded more than once of
having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be
a great deal better for her to remain single </s>
<s>  and told of poor isabella
and poor miss taylor </s>
<s> but it would not do </s>
<s>  emma hung about him
affectionately and smiled and said it must be so </s>
<s>  and that he must
not class her with isabella and <abvr> weston whose marriages taking them
from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change </s>
<s>  but she was not
going from hartfield </s>
<s>  she should be always there </s>
<s>  she was introducing
no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better </s>
<s>  and she
was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having <abvr>
knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea </s>
<s> did
he not love <abvr> knightley very much </s>
<s> he would not deny that he did
she was sure </s>
<s> whom did he ever want to consult on business but <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters
who so glad to assist him </s>
<s> who so cheerful so attentive so attached
to him </s>
<s> would not he like to have him always on the spot </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s>  that
was all very true </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley could not be there too often </s>
<s>  he should
be glad to see him every day </s>
<s> but they did see him every day as it
was </s>
<s> why could not they go on as they had done </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse could not be soon reconciled </s>
<s>  but the worst was overcome
the idea was given </s>
<s>  time and continual repetition must do the rest </s>
<s> to
emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded <abvr> knightleys whose fond
praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome </s>
<s>  and he was soon
used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion </s>
<s> they had all
the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest
approbation </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston was ready on the first meeting to
consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst as a settled
and secondly as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance
of the two recommendations to <abvr> woodhouses mind </s>
<s> it was agreed
upon as what was to be </s>
<s>  and every body by whom he was used to be
guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness </s>
<s>  and having some
feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some
time or otherin another year or two perhapsit might not be so very
bad if the marriage did take place </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she
said to him in favour of the event </s>
<s> she had been extremely surprized
never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her </s>
<s>  but she
saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in
urging him to the utmost </s>
<s> she had such a regard for <abvr> knightley as
to think he deserved even her dearest emma </s>
<s>  and it was in every respect
so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one
respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible
so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely
have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself
been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it
long ago </s>
<s> how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma
would have renounced their own home for hartfield </s>
<s>  and who but <abvr>
knightley could know and bear with <abvr> woodhouse so as to make such
an arrangement desirable </s>
<s> the difficulty of disposing of poor <abvr>
woodhouse had been always felt in her husbands plans and her own for
a marriage between frank and emma </s>
<s>  how to settle the claims of enscombe
and hartfield had been a continual impedimentless acknowledged by <abvr>
weston than by herselfbut even he had never been able to finish
the subject better than by sayingthose matters will take care of
themselves </s>
<s>  the young people will find a way </s>
<s>  but here there was
nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future </s>
<s>  it was
all right all open all equal </s>
<s>  no sacrifice on any side worth the name </s>
<s> 
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without
one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections
as these was one of the happiest women in the world </s>
<s>  if any thing could
increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have
outgrown its first set of caps </s>
<s> 

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston
had his five minutes share of it </s>
<s>  but five minutes were enough to
familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind </s>
<s> he saw the advantages
of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife </s>
<s> 
but the wonder of it was very soon nothing </s>
<s>  and by the end of an hour he
was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it </s>
<s> 

it is to be a secret i conclude said he </s>
<s>  these matters are always a
secret till it is found out that every body knows them </s>
<s>  only let me be
told when i may speak out </s>

<s> 

he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that
point </s>
<s>  he told her the news </s>

daughter </s>
<s> he must tell her </s>
<s>  and miss bates being present it passed
of course to <abvr> cole <abvr> perry and <abvr> elton immediately
afterwards </s>
<s>  it was no more than the principals were prepared for </s>
<s>  they
had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it
would be over highbury </s>
<s>  and were thinking of themselves as the evening
wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity </s>
<s> 

in general it was a very well approved match </s>

satisfaction </s>

chapter xviii


time passed on </s>
<s>  a few more tomorrows and the party from london would
be arriving </s>
<s>  it was an alarming change </s>
<s>  and emma was thinking of it one
morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when
mr </s>
<s>  knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by </s>
<s>  after the
first chat of pleasure he was silent </s>
<s>  and then in a graver tone began
with

i have something to tell you emma </s>
<s>  some news </s>
<s> 

good or bad </s>
<s>  said she quickly looking up in his face </s>
<s> 

i do not know which it ought to be called </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  good i am sure </s>
<s> i see it in your countenance </s>
<s>  you are trying not
to smile </s>
<s> 

i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid
my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  but why so </s>
<s> i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases
or amuses you should not please and amuse me too </s>
<s> 

there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not
think alike </s>
<s>  he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on
her face </s>
<s>  does nothing occur to you </s>
<s> do not you recollect </s>
<s> harriet
smith </s>
<s> 

her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though
she knew not what </s>
<s> 

have you heard from her yourself this morning </s>
<s>  cried he </s>
<s>  you have i
believe and know the whole </s>
<s> 

no i have not </s>
<s>  i know nothing </s>
<s>  pray tell me </s>
<s> 

you are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is </s>
<s>  harriet
smith marries robert martin </s>
<s> 

emma gave a start which did not seem like being preparedand her eyes
in eager gaze said no this is impossible </s>
<s>  but her lips were closed </s>
<s> 

it is so indeed continued <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i have it from robert
martin himself </s>
<s>  he left me not half an hour ago </s>
<s> 

she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement </s>
<s> 

you like it my emma as little as i feared </s>
<s> i wish our opinions were
the same </s>
<s>  but in time they will </s>
<s>  time you may be sure will make one
or the other of us think differently </s>
<s>  and in the meanwhile we need not
talk much on the subject </s>
<s> 

you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself </s>
<s> 
it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i
cannot believe it </s>
<s>  it seems an impossibility </s>
<s> you cannot mean to say
that harriet smith has accepted robert martin </s>
<s>  you cannot mean that he
has even proposed to her againyet </s>
<s>  you only mean that he intends it </s>
<s> 

i mean that he has done it answered <abvr> knightley with smiling but
determined decision and been accepted </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> then having recourse to her workbasket
in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite
feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be
expressing she added well now tell me every thing </s>
<s>  make this
intelligible to me </s>
<s>  how where when </s>
<s> let me know it all </s>
<s>  i never was
more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy i assure you </s>
<s> howhow
has it been possible </s>
<s> 

it is a very simple story </s>
<s>  he went to town on business three days ago
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send
to john </s>
<s> he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was
asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys </s>
<s>  they were
going to take the two eldest boys to astleys </s>
<s>  the party was to be our
brother and sister henry johnand miss smith </s>
<s>  my friend robert could
not resist </s>
<s>  they called for him in their way </s>
<s>  were all extremely amused </s>
<s> 
and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he
didand in the course of that visit as i understand he found an
opportunity of speaking to harriet </s>
<s>  and certainly did not speak
in vain </s>
<s> she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is
deserving </s>
<s>  he came down by yesterdays coach and was with me this
morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first
on my affairs and then on his own </s>
<s>  this is all that i can relate of
the how where and when </s>
<s>  your friend harriet will make a much
longer history when you see her </s>
<s> she will give you all the minute
particulars which only womans language can make interesting </s>
<s> in our
communications we deal only in the great </s>
<s> however i must say that
robert martins heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing </s>
<s> 
and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that
on quitting their box at astleys my brother took charge of <abvr> john
knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry </s>
<s> 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith
rather uneasy </s>
<s> 

he stopped </s>
<s> emma dared not attempt any immediate reply </s>
<s>  to speak she
was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness </s>
<s> 
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad </s>
<s>  her silence disturbed
him </s>
<s>  and after observing her a little while he added

emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you
unhappy </s>
<s>  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected </s>
<s>  his
situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies your
friend </s>
<s>  and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him
as you know him more </s>
<s>  his good sense and good principles would delight
you </s>
<s> as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend
in better hands </s>
<s>  his rank in society i would alter if i could which is
saying a great deal i assure you emma </s>
<s> you laugh at me about william
larkins </s>
<s>  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin </s>
<s> 

he wanted her to look up and smile </s>
<s>  and having now brought herself not
to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering

you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match </s>
<s>  i think
harriet is doing extremely well </s>
<s>  her connexions may be worse than
his </s>
<s>  in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they
are </s>
<s>  i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize </s>
<s>  you
cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me </s>
<s>  how peculiarly unprepared
i was </s>
<s> for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined
against him much more than she was before </s>
<s> 

you ought to know your friend best replied <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  but i
should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl not likely to be
very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her </s>
<s> 

emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe
you know her quite as well as i do </s>
<s> but <abvr> knightley are you
perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him </s>
<s> 
i could suppose she might in timebut can she already </s>
<s> did not you
misunderstand him </s>
<s> you were both talking of other things </s>
<s>  of business
shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you in the confusion of
so many subjects mistake him </s>
<s> it was not harriets hand that he was
certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox </s>
<s> 

the contrast between the countenance and air of <abvr> knightley and robert
martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings and so strong
was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriets
side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis
no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was
really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature </s>
<s> 
it could not be otherwise </s>
<s> 

do you dare say this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  do you dare to suppose me
so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of </s>
<s> what do
you deserve </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with
any other </s>
<s>  and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer </s>
<s>  are
you quite sure that you understand the terms on which <abvr> martin and
harriet now are </s>
<s> 

i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he
told me she had accepted him </s>
<s>  and that there was no obscurity nothing
doubtful in the words he used </s>
<s>  and i think i can give you a proof that
it must be so </s>
<s>  he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do </s>
<s>  he knew
of no one but <abvr> goddard to whom he could apply for information of
her relations or friends </s>
<s>  could i mention any thing more fit to be done
than to go to <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  i assured him that i could not </s>
<s>  then he
said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles
and most sincerely wish them happy </s>
<s> 

you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before </s>
<s> 

i hope sofor at that time i was a fool </s>
<s> 

and i am changed also </s>
<s>  for i am now very willing to grant you all
harriets good qualities </s>
<s>  i have taken some pains for your sake and for
robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much
in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her </s>
<s>  i have often
talked to her a good deal </s>
<s>  you must have seen that i did </s>
<s>  sometimes
indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor
martins cause which was never the case </s>
<s>  but from all my observations
i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good
notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in
the affections and utility of domestic life </s>
<s> much of this i have no
doubt she may thank you for </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  cried emma shaking her head </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  poor harriet </s>
<s> 

she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more
praise than she deserved </s>
<s> 

their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her
father </s>
<s>  she was not sorry </s>
<s>  she wanted to be alone </s>
<s>  her mind was in a
state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be
collected </s>
<s>  she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits </s>
<s>  and till she
had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she
could be fit for nothing rational </s>
<s> 

her fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put the
horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls </s>
<s>  and she
had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing </s>
<s> 

the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be
imagined </s>
<s>  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of
harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for
security </s>
<s> what had she to wish for </s>
<s>  nothing but to grow more worthy of
him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own </s>
<s> 
nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility
and circumspection in future </s>
<s> 

serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her
resolutions </s>
<s>  and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the
very midst of them </s>
<s>  she must laugh at such a close </s>
<s>  such an end of the
doleful disappointment of five weeks back </s>
<s>  such a heartsuch a harriet </s>
<s> 

now there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would be a
pleasure </s>
<s>  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin </s>
<s> 

high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the
reflection that all necessity of concealment from <abvr> knightley would
soon be over </s>
<s>  the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to
practise might soon be over </s>
<s>  she could now look forward to giving him
that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to
welcome as a duty </s>
<s> 

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father </s>
<s>  not
always listening but always agreeing to what he said </s>
<s>  and whether in
speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his
being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor <abvr> weston would be
disappointed </s>
<s> 

they arrived </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  weston was alone in the drawingroom </s>
<s> but hardly
had they been told of the baby and <abvr> woodhouse received the thanks
for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the
blind of two figures passing near the window </s>
<s> 

it is frank and miss fairfax said <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i was just going to
tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning </s>
<s>  he
stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the
day with us </s>
<s> they are coming in i hope </s>
<s> 

in half a minute they were in the room </s>
<s>  emma was extremely glad to
see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing
recollections on each side </s>
<s>  they met readily and smiling but with a
consciousness which at first allowed little to be said </s>
<s>  and having all
sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that
emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long
felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane
would yield its proportion of pleasure </s>
<s>  when <abvr> weston joined the
party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a
want of subject or animationor of courage and opportunity for frank
churchill to draw near her and say

i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message
in one of <abvr> westons letters </s>
<s>  i hope time has not made you less
willing to pardon </s>
<s>  i hope you do not retract what you then said </s>
<s> 

no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least </s>
<s>  i am
particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give you joy
in person </s>
<s> 

he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with
serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness </s>
<s> 

is not she looking well </s>
<s>  said he turning his eyes towards jane </s>
<s> 
better than she ever used to do </s>
<s> you see how my father and <abvr> weston
doat upon her </s>
<s> 

but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after
mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of
dixon </s>
<s> emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing </s>
<s> 

i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame </s>
<s> 

the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be </s>
<s>  but is it
possible that you had no suspicion </s>
<s> i mean of late </s>
<s>  early i know you
had none </s>
<s> 

i never had the smallest i assure you </s>
<s> 

that appears quite wonderful </s>
<s>  i was once very nearand i wish i
hadit would have been better </s>
<s>  but though i was always doing wrong
things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no
service </s>
<s> it would have been a much better transgression had i broken
the bond of secrecy and told you every thing </s>
<s> 

it is not now worth a regret said emma </s>
<s> 

i have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded to pay a
visit at randalls </s>
<s>  he wants to be introduced to her </s>
<s>  when the campbells
are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust
till we may carry her northward </s>
<s> but now i am at such a distance from
heris not it hard miss woodhouse </s>
<s> till this morning we have not
once met since the day of reconciliation </s>
<s>  do not you pity me </s>
<s> 

emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay
thought he cried

ah </s>
<s>  by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the
momenti hope <abvr> knightley is well </s>
<s>  he paused </s>
<s> she coloured and
laughed </s>
<s> i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish
in your favour </s>
<s>  let me return your congratulations </s>
<s> i assure you that
i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction </s>
<s> he is
a man whom i cannot presume to praise </s>
<s> 

emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style </s>
<s>  but
his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane
and his next words were

did you ever see such a skin </s>
<s> such smoothness </s>
<s>  such delicacy </s>
<s> and
yet without being actually fair </s>
<s> one cannot call her fair </s>
<s>  it is a
most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and haira most
distinguishing complexion </s>
<s>  so peculiarly the lady in it </s>
<s> just colour
enough for beauty </s>
<s> 

i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly </s>
<s>  but
do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so
pale </s>
<s> when we first began to talk of her </s>
<s> have you quite forgotten </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nowhat an impudent dog i was </s>
<s> how could i dare

but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help
saying

i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you
had very great amusement in tricking us all </s>
<s> i am sure you had </s>
<s> i am
sure it was a consolation to you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing </s>
<s>  i was the most
miserable wretch </s>
<s> 

not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth </s>
<s>  i am sure it was a
source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us
all in </s>
<s> perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the
truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same
situation </s>
<s>  i think there is a little likeness between us </s>
<s> 

he bowed </s>
<s> 

if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true
sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny </s>
<s>  the destiny which bids
fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own </s>
<s> 

true true he answered warmly </s>
<s>  no not true on your side </s>
<s>  you can
have no superior but most true on mine </s>
<s> she is a complete angel </s>
<s>  look
at her </s>
<s>  is not she an angel in every gesture </s>
<s>  observe the turn of her
throat </s>
<s>  observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father </s>
<s> you will
be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my
uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels </s>
<s>  they are to be new set </s>
<s> 
i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head </s>
<s>  will not it be
beautiful in her dark hair </s>
<s> 

very beautiful indeed replied emma </s>
<s>  and she spoke so kindly that he
gratefully burst out

how delighted i am to see you again </s>
<s>  and to see you in such excellent
looks </s>
<s> i would not have missed this meeting for the world </s>
<s>  i should
certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come </s>
<s> 

the others had been talking of the child <abvr> weston giving an account
of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the
infants appearing not quite well </s>
<s>  she believed she had been foolish
but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending
for <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  perhaps she ought to be ashamed but <abvr> weston had been
almost as uneasy as herself </s>
<s> in ten minutes however the child had
been perfectly well again </s>
<s>  this was her history </s>
<s>  and particularly
interesting it was to <abvr> woodhouse who commended her very much for
thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done
it </s>
<s>  she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the
slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment </s>
<s>  she could not be
too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often </s>
<s>  it was a pity perhaps
that he had not come last night </s>
<s>  for though the child seemed well now
very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had
seen it </s>
<s> 

frank churchill caught the name </s>
<s> 

perry </s>
<s>  said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss
fairfaxs eye </s>
<s>  my friend <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  what are they saying about <abvr>
perry </s>
<s> has he been here this morning </s>
<s> and how does he travel now </s>
<s> has
he set up his carriage </s>
<s> 

emma soon recollected and understood him </s>
<s>  and while she joined in the
laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she too was really
hearing him though trying to seem deaf </s>
<s> 

such an extraordinary dream of mine </s>
<s>  he cried </s>
<s>  i can never think of
it without laughing </s>
<s> she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i see
it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown </s>
<s>  look at her </s>
<s>  do
not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter
which sent me the report is passing under her eyethat the whole
blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else
though pretending to listen to the others </s>
<s> 

jane was forced to smile completely for a moment </s>
<s>  and the smile partly
remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet
steady voice

how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me </s>
<s> they
will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them </s>
<s> 

he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly </s>
<s>  but
emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument </s>
<s>  and on leaving
randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she
felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really
regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more
sensible of <abvr> knightleys high superiority of character </s>
<s>  the happiness
of this most happy day received its completion in the animated
contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced </s>
<s> 



chapter xix


if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a
momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her
attachment to <abvr> knightley and really able to accept another man from
unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the
recurrence of any such uncertainty </s>
<s>  a very few days brought the party
from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour
alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable
as it was </s>
<s> that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted <abvr> knightley
and was now forming all her views of happiness </s>
<s> 

harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first </s>
<s> 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and
selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with
the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the
fullest exultation in the present and future </s>
<s>  for as to her friends
approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by
meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations </s>
<s> harriet was
most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleys and the
dinner the next day </s>
<s>  she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight </s>
<s> 
but what did such particulars explain </s>
<s> the fact was as emma could now
acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin </s>
<s>  and that his
continuing to love her had been irresistible </s>
<s> beyond this it must ever
be unintelligible to emma </s>
<s> 

the event however was most joyful </s>
<s>  and every day was giving her fresh
reason for thinking so </s>
<s> harriets parentage became known </s>
<s>  she proved
to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the
comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to
have always wished for concealment </s>
<s> such was the blood of gentility
which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for </s>
<s> it was likely to
be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman </s>
<s>  but what
a connexion had she been preparing for <abvr> knightleyor for the
churchillsor even for <abvr> elton </s>
<s> the stain of illegitimacy
unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed </s>
<s> 

no objection was raised on the fathers side </s>
<s>  the young man was treated
liberally </s>
<s>  it was all as it should be </s>
<s>  and as emma became acquainted
with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully
acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could
bid fairest for her little friend </s>
<s>  she had no doubt of harriets
happiness with any goodtempered man </s>
<s>  but with him and in the home he
offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and
improvement </s>
<s>  she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her
and who had better sense than herself </s>
<s>  retired enough for safety
and occupied enough for cheerfulness </s>
<s>  she would be never led into
temptation nor left for it to find her out </s>
<s>  she would be respectable
and happy </s>
<s>  and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the
world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a
man </s>
<s> or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself </s>
<s> 

harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins
was less and less at hartfield </s>
<s>  which was not to be regretted </s>
<s> the
intimacy between her and emma must sink </s>
<s>  their friendship must change
into a calmer sort of goodwill </s>
<s>  and fortunately what ought to be
and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural
manner </s>
<s> 

before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as
no remembrances even connected with <abvr> elton as he stood before them
could impair </s>
<s> perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw <abvr> elton
but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on
herself </s>
<s> robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of
the three were the first to be married </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells </s>
<s> the <abvr> churchills
were also in town </s>
<s>  and they were only waiting for november </s>
<s> 

the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by
emma and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> they had determined that their marriage ought
to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to
allow them the fortnights absence in a tour to the seaside which was
the plan </s>
<s> john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in
approving it </s>
<s>  but <abvr> woodhousehow was <abvr> woodhouse to be induced
to consent </s>
<s> he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a
distant event </s>
<s> 

when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were
almost hopeless </s>
<s> a second allusion indeed gave less pain </s>
<s> he
began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent ita very
promising step of the mind on its way to resignation </s>
<s>  still however he
was not happy </s>
<s>  nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters
courage failed </s>
<s>  she could not bear to see him suffering to know
him fancying himself neglected </s>
<s>  and though her understanding almost
acquiesced in the assurance of both the <abvr> knightleys that when
once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she
hesitatedshe could not proceed </s>
<s> 

in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden
illumination of <abvr> woodhouses mind or any wonderful change of his
nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another
way </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  westons poultryhouse was robbed one night of all her
turkeysevidently by the ingenuity of man </s>
<s>  other poultryyards in
the neighbourhood also suffered </s>
<s> pilfering was housebreaking to <abvr>
woodhouses fears </s>
<s> he was very uneasy </s>
<s>  and but for the sense of his
soninlaws protection would have been under wretched alarm every
night of his life </s>
<s>  the strength resolution and presence of mind of the
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys commanded his fullest dependence </s>
<s>  while either of them
protected him and his hartfield was safe </s>
<s> but <abvr> john knightley must
be in london again by the end of the first week in november </s>
<s> 

the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the
moment she was able to fix her weddingdayand <abvr> elton was called
on within a month from the marriage of <abvr> and <abvr> robert martin to
join the hands of <abvr> knightley and miss woodhouse </s>
<s> 

the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have
no taste for finery or parade </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton from the particulars
detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very
inferior to her own </s>
<s> very little white satin very few lace veils </s>
<s>  a
most pitiful business </s>
<s> selina would stare when she heard of it </s>
<s> but
in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence
the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the
ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union </s>
<s>
