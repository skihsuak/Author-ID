<s> it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife </s>

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds

<s> 

my dear <abvr> bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet replied that he had not </s>
<s> 

but it is returned she </s>
<s>  for <abvr> long has just been here and she
told me all about it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet made no answer </s>
<s> 

do you not want to know who has taken it </s>
<s>  cried his wife impatiently </s>
<s> 

you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it </s>
<s> 

this was invitation enough </s>
<s> 

why my dear you must know <abvr> long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england </s>
<s>  that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with <abvr> morris immediately </s>
<s>  that he
is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week </s>
<s> 

what is his name </s>
<s> 

bingley </s>
<s> 

is he married or single </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  single my dear to be sure </s>
<s>  a single man of large fortune </s>
<s>  four or
five thousand a year </s>
<s>  what a fine thing for our girls </s>
<s> 

how so </s>
<s>  how can it affect them </s>
<s> 

my dear <abvr> bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome </s>
<s>  you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them </s>
<s> 

is that his design in settling here </s>
<s> 

design </s>
<s>  nonsense how can you talk so </s>
<s>  but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes </s>
<s> 

i see no occasion for that </s>
<s>  you and the girls may go or you may send
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are
as handsome as any of them <abvr> bingley may like you the best of the
party </s>
<s> 

my dear you flatter me </s>
<s>  i certainly have had my share of beauty but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now </s>
<s>  when a woman has five
grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty </s>
<s> 

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of </s>
<s> 

but my dear you must indeed go and see <abvr> bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood </s>
<s> 

it is more than i engage for i assure you </s>
<s> 

but consider your daughters </s>
<s>  only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them </s>
<s>  sir william and lady lucas are determined to
go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no
newcomers </s>
<s>  indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to
visit him if you do not </s>
<s> 

you are overscrupulous surely </s>
<s>  i dare say <abvr> bingley will be very
glad to see you </s>
<s>  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls </s>
<s>  though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy </s>
<s> 

i desire you will do no such thing </s>
<s>  lizzy is not a bit better than the
others </s>
<s>  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so
goodhumoured as lydia </s>
<s>  but you are always giving her the preference </s>
<s> 

they have none of them much to recommend them replied he </s>
<s>  they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls </s>
<s>  but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way </s>
<s>  you
take delight in vexing me </s>
<s>  you have no compassion for my poor nerves </s>
<s> 

you mistake me my dear </s>
<s>  i have a high respect for your nerves </s>
<s>  they
are my old friends </s>
<s>  i have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least </s>
<s> 

ah you do not know what i suffer </s>
<s> 

but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood </s>
<s> 

it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them </s>
<s> 

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them
all </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character </s>
<s>  her mind
was less difficult to develop </s>
<s>  she was a woman of mean understanding
little information and uncertain temper </s>
<s>  when she was discontented
she fancied herself nervous </s>
<s>  the business of her life was to get her
daughters married </s>
<s>  its solace was visiting and news </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  he
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go </s>
<s>  and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it </s>
<s>  it was then disclosed in the following
manner </s>
<s>  observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
suddenly addressed her with </s>
<s> 

i hope <abvr> bingley will like it lizzy </s>
<s> 

we are not in a way to know what <abvr> bingley likes said her mother
resentfully since we are not to visit </s>
<s> 

but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the
assemblies and that <abvr> long promised to introduce him </s>
<s> 

i do not believe <abvr> long will do any such thing </s>
<s>  she has two nieces
of her own </s>
<s>  she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion
of her </s>
<s> 

no more have i said <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain
herself began scolding one of her daughters </s>
<s> 

dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake </s>
<s>  have a little
compassion on my nerves </s>
<s>  you tear them to pieces </s>
<s> 

kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father </s>
<s>  she times
them ill </s>
<s> 

i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully </s>
<s>  when is
your next ball to be lizzy </s>
<s> 

tomorrow fortnight </s>
<s> 

aye so it is cried her mother and <abvr> long does not come back
till the day before </s>
<s>  so it will be impossible for her to introduce him
for she will not know him herself </s>
<s> 

then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce
mr </s>
<s>  bingley to her </s>
<s> 

impossible <abvr> bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
myself </s>
<s>  how can you be so teasing </s>
<s> 

i honour your circumspection </s>
<s>  a fortnights acquaintance is certainly
very little </s>
<s>  one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight </s>
<s>  but if we do not venture somebody else will </s>
<s>  and after all
mrs </s>
<s>  long and her neices must stand their chance </s>
<s>  and therefore as
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will
take it on myself </s>
<s> 

the girls stared at their father </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet said only nonsense
nonsense </s>
<s> 

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation </s>
<s>  cried he </s>
<s>  do
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on
them as nonsense </s>
<s>  i cannot quite agree with you there </s>
<s>  what say you
mary </s>
<s>  for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read
great books and make extracts </s>
<s> 

mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how </s>
<s> 

while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to <abvr>
bingley </s>
<s> 

i am sick of <abvr> bingley cried his wife </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to hear that </s>
<s>  but why did not you tell me that before </s>
<s>  if
i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called
on him </s>
<s>  it is very unlucky </s>
<s>  but as i have actually paid the visit we
cannot escape the acquaintance now </s>
<s> 

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished </s>
<s>  that of <abvr>
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest </s>
<s>  though when the first tumult of joy
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while </s>
<s> 

how good it was in you my dear <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  but i knew i should
persuade you at last </s>
<s>  i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance </s>
<s>  well how pleased i am </s>
<s>  and it is such a
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now </s>
<s> 

now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  and
as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife </s>
<s> 

what an excellent father you have girls </s>
<s>  said she when the door was
shut </s>
<s>  i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness </s>
<s> 
or me either for that matter </s>
<s>  at our time of life it is not so
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day </s>
<s>  but
for your sakes we would do anything </s>
<s>  lydia my love though you are
the youngest i dare say <abvr> bingley will dance with you at the next
ball </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said lydia stoutly i am not afraid </s>
<s>  for though i am the
youngest im the tallest </s>
<s> 

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return <abvr> bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to
dinner </s>
<s> 

not all that <abvr> bennet however with the assistance of her five
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  they attacked him
in various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and
distant surmises </s>
<s>  but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at
last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas </s>
<s>  her report was highly favourable </s>
<s>  sir william had been
delighted with him </s>
<s>  he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party </s>
<s>  nothing could be more delightful </s>
<s>  to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love </s>
<s>  and very lively
hopes of <abvr> bingleys heart were entertained </s>
<s> 

if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield
 said <abvr> bennet to her husband and all the others equally well
married i shall have nothing to wish for </s>
<s> 

in a few days <abvr> bingley returned <abvr> bennets visit and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library </s>
<s>  he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had
heard much </s>
<s>  but he saw only the father </s>
<s>  the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse </s>
<s> 

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched </s>
<s>  and already
had <abvr> bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable
to accept the honour of their invitation etc </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was quite
disconcerted </s>
<s>  she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be </s>
<s>  lady lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get
a large party for the ball </s>
<s>  and a report soon followed that <abvr> bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly </s>
<s> 
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin </s>
<s>  and when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogethermr </s>
<s>  bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and
another young man </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike </s>
<s>  he had a pleasant
countenance and easy unaffected manners </s>
<s>  his sisters were fine women
with an air of decided fashion </s>
<s>  his brotherinlaw <abvr> hurst merely
looked the gentleman </s>
<s>  but his friend <abvr> darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year </s>
<s>  the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than <abvr> bingley and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity </s>
<s>  for he was discovered to be
proud </s>
<s>  to be above his company and above being pleased </s>
<s>  and not all
his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room </s>
<s>  he was lively and unreserved danced every dance
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving
one himself at netherfield </s>
<s>  such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves </s>
<s>  what a contrast between him and his friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy danced
only once with <abvr> hurst and once with miss bingley declined being
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party </s>
<s> 
his character was decided </s>
<s>  he was the proudest most disagreeable man
in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again </s>
<s> 
amongst the most violent against him was <abvr> bennet whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters </s>
<s> 

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit
down for two dances </s>
<s>  and during part of that time <abvr> darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and <abvr>
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend
to join it </s>
<s> 

come darcy said he i must have you dance </s>
<s>  i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner </s>
<s>  you had much better
dance </s>
<s> 

i certainly shall not </s>
<s>  you know how i detest it unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner </s>
<s>  at such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable </s>
<s>  your sisters are engaged and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with </s>
<s> 

i would not be so fastidious as you are cried <abvr> bingley for a
kingdom </s>
<s>  upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as i have this evening </s>
<s>  and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty </s>
<s> 

you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said <abvr>
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld </s>
<s>  but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i
dare say very agreeable </s>
<s>  do let me ask my partner to introduce you </s>
<s> 

which do you mean </s>
<s>  and turning round he looked for a moment at
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said </s>
<s> 
she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me </s>
<s>  i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men </s>
<s>  you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles for you are wasting your time with me </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley followed his advice </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy walked off </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him </s>
<s>  she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends </s>
<s>  for she had a lively
playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous </s>
<s> 

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley had danced with her twice and she had been
distinguished by his sisters </s>
<s>  jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be though in a quieter way </s>
<s>  elizabeth felt janes
pleasure </s>
<s>  mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball </s>
<s>  they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they
were the principal inhabitants </s>
<s>  they found <abvr> bennet still up </s>
<s>  with
a book he was regardless of time </s>
<s>  and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations </s>
<s>  he had rather hoped that his wifes views on
the stranger would be disappointed </s>
<s>  but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> bennet as she entered the room we have had a most
delightful evening a most excellent ball </s>
<s>  i wish you had been there </s>
<s> 
jane was so admired nothing could be like it </s>
<s>  everybody said how well
she looked </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with
her twice </s>
<s>  only think of that my dear </s>
<s>  he actually danced with her
twice </s>
<s>  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time </s>
<s>  first of all he asked miss lucas </s>
<s>  i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her </s>
<s>  but however he did not admire her at all </s>
<s>  indeed nobody
can you know </s>
<s>  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance </s>
<s>  so he inquired who she was and got introduced and
asked her for the two next </s>
<s>  then the two third he danced with miss king
and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again
and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger

if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently
he would not have danced half so much </s>
<s>  for gods sake say no more of
his partners </s>
<s>  oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear i am quite delighted with him </s>
<s>  he is so excessively
handsome </s>
<s>  and his sisters are charming women </s>
<s>  i never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses </s>
<s>  i dare say the lace upon <abvr>
hursts gown

here she was interrupted again </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet protested against any
description of finery </s>
<s>  she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy </s>
<s>  for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at
all worth pleasing </s>
<s>  so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him </s>
<s>  he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very
great </s>
<s>  not handsome enough to dance with </s>
<s>  i wish you had been there my
dear to have given him one of your setdowns </s>
<s>  i quite detest the man </s>
<s> 



chapter 


when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in
her praise of <abvr> bingley before expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him </s>
<s> 

he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible
goodhumoured lively </s>
<s>  and i never saw such happy manners </s>
<s> so much
ease with such perfect good breeding </s>
<s> 

he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can </s>
<s>  his character is thereby complete </s>
<s> 

i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time </s>
<s>  i
did not expect such a compliment </s>
<s> 

did not you </s>
<s>  i did for you </s>
<s>  but that is one great difference between
us </s>
<s>  compliments always take you by surprise and me never </s>
<s>  what
could be more natural than his asking you again </s>
<s>  he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room </s>
<s>  no thanks to his gallantry for that </s>
<s>  well he certainly is
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him </s>
<s>  you have liked many a
stupider person </s>
<s> 

dear lizzy </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general </s>
<s> 
you never see a fault in anybody </s>
<s>  all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes </s>
<s>  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life </s>
<s> 

i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone </s>
<s>  but i always speak
what i think </s>
<s> 

i know you do </s>
<s>  and it is that which makes the wonder </s>
<s>  with your
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others </s>
<s>  affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it
everywhere </s>
<s>  but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the
good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing
of the badbelongs to you alone </s>
<s>  and so you like this mans sisters
too do you </s>
<s>  their manners are not equal to his </s>
<s> 

certainly notat first </s>
<s>  but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them </s>
<s>  miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house </s>
<s>  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced </s>
<s>  their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general </s>
<s>  and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she
was very little disposed to approve them </s>
<s>  they were in fact very fine
ladies </s>
<s>  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and
conceited </s>
<s>  they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of
associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others </s>
<s>  they were of
a respectable family in the north of england </s>
<s>  a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an
estate but did not live to do it </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley intended it likewise and
sometimes made choice of his county </s>
<s>  but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to
purchase </s>
<s> 

his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own </s>
<s>  but
though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was <abvr> hurst who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at netherfield house </s>
<s>  he did look at it and into it for
halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it
immediately </s>
<s> 

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of
great opposition of character </s>
<s>  bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied </s>
<s>  on the strength of darcys regard bingley
had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion </s>
<s> 
in understanding darcy was the superior </s>
<s>  bingley was by no means
deficient but darcy was clever </s>
<s>  he was at the same time haughty
reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not
inviting </s>
<s>  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage </s>
<s>  bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually
giving offense </s>
<s> 

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic </s>
<s>  bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life </s>
<s>  everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him </s>
<s>  there had been no formality no stiffness </s>
<s>  he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room </s>
<s>  and as to miss bennet he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful </s>
<s>  darcy on the contrary had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received
either attention or pleasure </s>
<s>  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty
but she smiled too much </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired
her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one
whom they would not object to know more of </s>
<s>  miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose </s>
<s> 



chapter 


within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate </s>
<s>  sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty </s>
<s> 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly </s>
<s>  it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town </s>
<s> 
and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and
unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world </s>
<s>  for though elated by his rank it did not render him
supercilious </s>
<s>  on the contrary he was all attention to everybody </s>
<s>  by
nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st </s>
<s> 
jamess had made him courteous </s>
<s> 

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  they had several children </s>
<s>  the eldest
of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was
elizabeths intimate friend </s>
<s> 

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary </s>
<s>  and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate </s>
<s> 

you began the evening well charlotte said <abvr> bennet with civil
selfcommand to miss lucas </s>
<s>  you were <abvr> bingleys first choice </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but he seemed to like his second better </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice </s>
<s>  to be
sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he
didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething
about <abvr> robinson </s>
<s> 

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and <abvr> robinson </s>
<s>  did not
i mention it to you </s>
<s>  <abvr> robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest </s>

answering immediately to the last question </s>
<s>  ˜oh </s>
<s>  the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt </s>
<s>  there cannot be two opinions on that point </s>
<s> 

upon my word </s>
<s>  well that is very decided indeedthat does seem as
ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know </s>
<s> 

my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said
charlotte </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend
is he </s>
<s> poor eliza </s>
<s> to be only just tolerable </s>
<s> 

i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him </s>
<s>  <abvr> long told me last night that he
sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips </s>
<s> 

are you quite sure maam </s>
<s> is not there a little mistake </s>
<s>  said jane </s>
<s> 
i certainly saw <abvr> darcy speaking to her </s>
<s> 

ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he
could not help answering her </s>
<s>  but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to </s>
<s> 

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much
unless among his intimate acquaintances </s>
<s>  with them he is remarkably
agreeable </s>
<s> 

i do not believe a word of it my dear </s>
<s>  if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to <abvr> long </s>
<s>  but i can guess how it
was </s>
<s>  everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had
heard somehow that <abvr> long does not keep a carriage and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise </s>
<s> 

i do not mind his not talking to <abvr> long said miss lucas but i
wish he had danced with eliza </s>
<s> 

another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him
if i were you </s>
<s> 

i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him </s>
<s> 

his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride
often does because there is an excuse for it </s>
<s>  one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour
should think highly of himself </s>
<s>  if i may so express it he has a right
to be proud </s>
<s> 

that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive
his pride if he had not mortified mine </s>
<s> 

pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections is a very common failing i believe </s>
<s>  by all that i have
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed </s>
<s>  that human
nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some
quality or other real or imaginary </s>
<s>  vanity and pride are different
things though the words are often used synonymously </s>
<s>  a person may
be proud without being vain </s>
<s>  pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us </s>
<s> 

if i were as rich as <abvr> darcy cried a young lucas who came with
his sisters i should not care how proud i was </s>
<s>  i would keep a pack of
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day </s>
<s> 

then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said <abvr>
bennet </s>
<s>  and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly </s>
<s> 

the boy protested that she should not </s>
<s>  she continued to declare that she
would and the argument ended only with the visit </s>

chapter 


the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield </s>
<s>  the visit
was soon returned in due form </s>
<s>  miss bennets pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of <abvr> hurst and miss bingley </s>
<s>  and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to
a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards
the two eldest </s>
<s>  by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them </s>
<s> 
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration </s>
<s>  it
was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and
to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a
way to be very much in love </s>
<s>  but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent </s>
<s>  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas </s>
<s> 

it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose
on the public in such a case </s>
<s>  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded </s>
<s>  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him </s>
<s>  and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark </s>
<s>  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself </s>
<s>  we can all
begin freelya slight preference is natural enough </s>
<s>  but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement </s>
<s>  in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more
affection than she feels </s>
<s>  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly </s>
<s>  but he
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on </s>
<s> 

but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow </s>
<s>  if i can
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too </s>
<s> 

remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do </s>
<s> 

but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal
it he must find it out </s>
<s> 

perhaps he must if he sees enough of her </s>
<s>  but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together </s>
<s>  and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together </s>
<s>  jane should
therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his
attention </s>
<s>  when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses </s>
<s> 

your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined
to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it </s>
<s>  but
these are not janes feelings </s>
<s>  she is not acting by design </s>
<s>  as yet
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness </s>
<s>  she has known him only a fortnight </s>
<s>  she danced four
dances with him at meryton </s>
<s>  she saw him one morning at his own house
and has since dined with him in company four times </s>
<s>  this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character </s>
<s> 

not as you represent it </s>
<s>  had she merely dined with him she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite </s>
<s>  but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four
evenings may do a great deal </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like vingtun better than commerce </s>
<s>  but with respect to any other
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded </s>
<s> 

well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart </s>
<s>  and
if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth </s>
<s>  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance </s>
<s>  if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the
least </s>
<s>  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation </s>
<s>  and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life </s>
<s> 

you make me laugh charlotte </s>
<s>  but it is not sound </s>
<s>  you know it is not
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself </s>
<s> 

occupied in observing <abvr> bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty </s>
<s>  he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball </s>
<s>  and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise </s>
<s>  but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes </s>
<s>  to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying </s>
<s>  though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing </s>
<s>  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness </s>
<s>  of
this she was perfectly unaware </s>
<s>  to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with </s>
<s> 

he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing
with her himself attended to her conversation with others </s>
<s>  his doing so
drew her notice </s>
<s>  it was at sir william lucass where a large party were
assembled </s>
<s> 

what does <abvr> darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster </s>
<s> 

that is a question which <abvr> darcy only can answer </s>
<s> 

but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about </s>
<s>  he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him </s>
<s> 

on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him </s>
<s>  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she
turned to him and said </s>
<s> 

did you not think <abvr> darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly
well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton </s>
<s> 

with great energy </s>
<s>  but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic </s>
<s> 

you are severe on us </s>
<s> 

it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas </s>
<s>  i am going
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows </s>
<s> 

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend </s>
<s> always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody </s>
<s>  if my vanity had taken
a musical turn you would have been invaluable </s>
<s>  but as it is i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers </s>
<s>  on miss lucass persevering however
she added very well if it must be so it must </s>
<s>  and gravely glancing
at <abvr> darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of
course familiar with </s>
<s>  ˜keep your breath to cool your porridge </s>
<s>  and i
shall keep mine to swell my song </s>
<s> 

her performance was pleasing though by no means capital </s>
<s>  after a song
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always
impatient for display </s>
<s> 

mary had neither genius nor taste </s>
<s>  and though vanity had given her
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached </s>
<s>  elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with
much more pleasure though not playing half so well </s>
<s>  and mary at the
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who
with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was
his neighbour till sir william thus began </s>
<s> 

what a charming amusement for young people this is <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  there
is nothing like dancing after all </s>
<s>  i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society </s>
<s> 

certainly sir </s>
<s>  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world </s>
<s>  every savage can dance </s>
<s> 

sir william only smiled </s>
<s>  your friend performs delightfully he
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group </s>
<s>  and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir </s>
<s> 

yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight </s>
<s>  do
you often dance at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s> 

never sir </s>
<s> 

do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place </s>
<s> 

it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it </s>
<s> 

you have a house in town i conclude </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy bowed </s>
<s> 

i had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fond
of superior society </s>
<s>  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas </s>
<s> 

he paused in hopes of an answer </s>
<s>  but his companion was not disposed
to make any </s>
<s>  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to
her </s>
<s> 

my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner </s>
<s>  you
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you </s>
<s> 
 and taking her hand he would have given it to <abvr> darcy who though
extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william </s>
<s> 

indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing </s>
<s>  i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand but in vain </s>
<s>  elizabeth was determined </s>
<s>  nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion </s>
<s> 

you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you </s>
<s>  and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us
for one halfhour </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling </s>
<s> 

he is indeed </s>
<s>  but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza
we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a
partner </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked archly and turned away </s>
<s>  her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some
complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley </s>
<s> 

i can guess the subject of your reverie </s>
<s> 

i should imagine not </s>
<s> 

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this mannerin such society </s>
<s>  and indeed i am quite of your opinion </s>
<s> 
i was never more annoyed </s>
<s>  the insipidity and yet the noisethe
nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people </s>
<s>  what would
i give to hear your strictures on them </s>
<s> 

your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you </s>
<s>  my mind was more
agreeably engaged </s>
<s>  i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow </s>
<s> 

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  darcy replied with great intrepidity </s>
<s> 

miss elizabeth bennet </s>
<s> 

miss elizabeth bennet </s>
<s>  repeated miss bingley </s>
<s>  i am all astonishment </s>
<s> 
how long has she been such a favourite </s>
<s> and pray when am i to wish you
joy </s>
<s> 

that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask </s>
<s>  a ladys
imagination is very rapid </s>
<s>  it jumps from admiration to love from love
to matrimony in a moment </s>
<s>  i knew you would be wishing me joy </s>
<s> 

nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled </s>
<s>  you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed </s>
<s> 
and of course she will always be at pemberley with you </s>
<s> 

he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner </s>
<s>  and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe her wit flowed long </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed
in default of heirs male on a distant relation </s>
<s>  and their mothers
fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply
the deficiency of his </s>
<s>  her father had been an attorney in meryton and
had left her four thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

she had a sister married to a <abvr> phillips who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade </s>
<s> 

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton </s>
<s>  a most
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliners shop just over the way </s>
<s>  the two youngest of the family
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions </s>
<s> 
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing
better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening </s>
<s>  and however bare of news
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt </s>
<s>  at present indeed they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood </s>
<s>  it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the
headquarters </s>
<s> 

their visits to <abvr> phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence </s>
<s>  every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers names and connections </s>
<s>  their lodgings were not long a
secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves </s>
<s>  <abvr>
phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before </s>
<s>  they could talk of nothing but officers </s>
<s>  and
mr </s>
<s>  bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation
to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign </s>
<s> 

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject <abvr>
bennet coolly observed </s>
<s> 

from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country </s>
<s>  i have suspected it some time but
i am now convinced </s>
<s> 

catherine was disconcerted and made no answer </s>
<s>  but lydia with perfect
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the
next morning to london </s>
<s> 

i am astonished my dear said <abvr> bennet that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly </s>
<s>  if i wished to think slightingly
of anybodys children it should not be of my own however </s>
<s> 

if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it </s>
<s> 

yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever </s>
<s> 

this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree </s>
<s>  i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish </s>
<s> 

my dear <abvr> bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother </s>
<s>  when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do </s>
<s>  i remember the time when
i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my
heart </s>
<s>  and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year
should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him </s>
<s>  and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in
his regimentals </s>
<s> 

mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first
came </s>
<s>  she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for miss bennet </s>
<s>  it came from netherfield and the servant waited
for an answer </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was
eagerly calling out while her daughter read

<s>  what does he say </s>
<s>  well
jane make haste and tell us </s>
<s>  make haste my love </s>
<s> 

it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud </s>
<s> 

my dear friend

if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives

dining out said <abvr> bennet that is very unlucky </s>
<s> 

can i have the carriage </s>
<s>  said jane </s>
<s> 

no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to
rain </s>
<s>  and then you must stay all night </s>
<s> 

that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but the gentlemen will have <abvr> bingleys chaise to go to meryton
and the hursts have no horses to theirs </s>
<s> 

i had much rather go in the coach </s>
<s> 

but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure </s>
<s>  they are
wanted in the farm <abvr> bennet are they not </s>
<s> 

they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them </s>
<s> 

but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose
will be answered </s>
<s> 

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged </s>
<s>  jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day </s>
<s>  her hopes were answered </s>
<s>  jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard </s>
<s>  her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was
delighted </s>
<s>  the rain continued the whole evening without intermission </s>
<s> 
jane certainly could not come back </s>
<s> 

this was a lucky idea of mine indeed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bennet more than
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own </s>
<s>  till the
next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance </s>
<s>  breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth </s>
<s> 

my dearest lizzy

i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday </s>
<s>  my kind friends will not
hear of my returning till i am better </s>
<s>  they insist also on my seeing <abvr>
jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the
matter with me </s>
<s> yours etc </s>
<s> 

well my dear said <abvr> bennet when elizabeth had read the note
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr </s>
<s>  bingley and under your orders </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i am not afraid of her dying </s>
<s>  people do not die of little trifling
colds </s>
<s>  she will be taken good care of </s>
<s>  as long as she stays there it is
all very well </s>
<s>  i would go and see her if i could have the carriage </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though
the carriage was not to be had </s>
<s>  and as she was no horsewoman walking
was her only alternative </s>
<s>  she declared her resolution </s>
<s> 

how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a
thing in all this dirt </s>
<s>  you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there </s>
<s> 

i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want </s>
<s> 

is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the
horses </s>
<s> 

no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk </s>
<s>  the distance is nothing
when one has a motive </s>
<s>  only three miles </s>
<s>  i shall be back by dinner </s>
<s> 

i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason </s>
<s>  and in my opinion
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required </s>
<s> 

we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia </s>
<s> 
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off
together </s>
<s> 

if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes </s>
<s> 

in meryton they parted </s>
<s>  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last
within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise </s>
<s> 

she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise </s>
<s> 
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to <abvr> hurst and
miss bingley </s>
<s>  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it </s>
<s>  she was received however very politely by them </s>
<s>  and in their
brothers manners there was something better than politeness </s>
<s>  there
was good humour and kindness </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy said very little and <abvr>
hurst nothing at all </s>
<s>  the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as
to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone </s>
<s>  the latter was
thinking only of his breakfast </s>
<s> 

her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered </s>
<s>  miss
bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not
well enough to leave her room </s>
<s>  elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately </s>
<s>  and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance </s>
<s>  she was not equal
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them
together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with </s>
<s>  elizabeth silently attended
her </s>
<s> 

when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane </s>
<s>  the apothecary came and having
examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught
a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it </s>
<s> 
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts </s>
<s>  the advice
was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head
ached acutely </s>
<s>  elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment </s>
<s>  nor were
the other ladies often absent </s>
<s>  the gentlemen being out they had in
fact nothing to do elsewhere </s>
<s> 

when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very
unwillingly said so </s>
<s>  miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer

elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to

chapter 


at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner </s>
<s>  to the civil inquiries which then
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of <abvr> bingleys she could not make a very
favourable answer </s>
<s>  jane was by no means better </s>
<s>  the sisters on hearing
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how
shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves </s>
<s>  and then thought no more of the matter </s>
<s>  and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike </s>
<s> 

their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency </s>
<s>  his anxiety for jane was evident and his
attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others </s>
<s>  she had very little notice from any but him </s>
<s>  miss bingley was
engrossed by <abvr> darcy her sister scarcely less so </s>
<s>  and as for <abvr>
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to
eat drink and play at cards </s>
<s>  who when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her </s>
<s> 

when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room </s>
<s>  her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence </s>
<s> 
she had no conversation no style no beauty </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst thought the
same and added </s>
<s> 

she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent
walker </s>
<s>  i shall never forget her appearance this morning </s>
<s>  she really
looked almost wild </s>
<s> 

she did indeed louisa </s>
<s>  i could hardly keep my countenance </s>
<s>  very
nonsensical to come at all </s>
<s>  why must she be scampering about the
country because her sister had a cold </s>
<s>  her hair so untidy so blowsy </s>
<s> 

yes and her petticoat </s>
<s>  i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep
in mud i am absolutely certain </s>
<s>  and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office </s>
<s> 

your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley </s>
<s>  but this was
all lost upon me </s>
<s>  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning </s>
<s>  her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice </s>
<s> 

you observed it <abvr> darcy i am sure said miss bingley </s>
<s>  and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
an exhibition </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s> 

to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is
above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone </s>
<s>  what could she mean by
it </s>
<s>  it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence
a most countrytown indifference to decorum </s>
<s> 

it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said
bingley </s>
<s> 

i am afraid <abvr> darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes </s>
<s> 

not at all he replied </s>
<s>  they were brightened by the exercise </s>
<s>  a
short pause followed this speech and <abvr> hurst began again </s>
<s> 

i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very
sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled </s>
<s>  but with
such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is
no chance of it </s>
<s> 

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside </s>
<s> 

that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily </s>
<s> 

if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it
would not make them one jot less agreeable </s>
<s> 

but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world replied darcy </s>
<s> 

to this speech bingley made no answer </s>
<s>  but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friends vulgar relations </s>
<s> 

with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on
leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee </s>
<s> 
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till
late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself </s>
<s>  on entering the drawingroom she found the whole
party at loo and was immediately invited to join them </s>
<s>  but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst looked at her with astonishment </s>
<s> 

do you prefer reading to cards </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  that is rather singular </s>
<s> 

miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards </s>
<s>  she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else </s>
<s> 

i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i am
not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things </s>
<s> 

in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley </s>
<s>  and
i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well </s>
<s> 

elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying </s>
<s>  he immediately offered to fetch her
othersall that his library afforded </s>
<s> 

and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit </s>
<s>  but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more
than i ever looked into </s>
<s> 

elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room </s>
<s> 

i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left
so small a collection of books </s>
<s>  what a delightful library you have at
pemberley <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many
generations </s>
<s> 

and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying
books </s>
<s> 

i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these </s>
<s> 

neglect </s>
<s>  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place </s>
<s>  charles when you build your house i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley </s>
<s> 

i wish it may </s>
<s> 

but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model </s>
<s>  there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire </s>
<s> 

with all my heart </s>
<s>  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it </s>
<s> 

i am talking of possibilities charles </s>
<s> 

upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very
little attention for her book </s>
<s>  and soon laying it wholly aside she drew
near the cardtable and stationed herself between <abvr> bingley and his
eldest sister to observe the game </s>
<s> 

is miss darcy much grown since the spring </s>
<s>  said miss bingley </s>
<s>  will
she be as tall as i am </s>
<s> 

i think she will </s>
<s>  she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or
rather taller </s>
<s> 

how i long to see her again </s>
<s>  i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much </s>
<s>  such a countenance such manners </s>
<s>  and so extremely accomplished
for her age </s>
<s>  her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite </s>
<s> 

it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are </s>
<s> 

all young ladies accomplished </s>
<s>  my dear charles what do you mean </s>
<s> 

yes all of them i think </s>
<s>  they all paint tables cover screens and
net purses </s>
<s>  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure
i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being
informed that she was very accomplished </s>
<s> 

your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has
too much truth </s>
<s>  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen </s>
<s>  but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general </s>
<s>  i
cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished </s>
<s> 

nor i i am sure said miss bingley </s>
<s> 

then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman </s>
<s> 

yes i do comprehend a great deal in it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with </s>
<s>  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word </s>
<s>  and besides
all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word
will be but halfdeserved </s>
<s> 

all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading </s>
<s> 

i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women </s>
<s> 
i rather wonder now at your knowing any </s>
<s> 

are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this </s>
<s> 

i never saw such a woman </s>
<s>  i never saw such capacity and taste and
application and elegance as you describe united </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description when <abvr> hurst called them to order with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward </s>
<s>  as all
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room </s>
<s> 

elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her
is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own </s>
<s>  and with many men i dare say it
succeeds </s>
<s>  but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed
there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation </s>
<s>  whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable </s>
<s> 

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject </s>
<s> 

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and
that she could not leave her </s>
<s>  bingley urged <abvr> jones being sent for
immediately </s>
<s>  while his sisters convinced that no country advice could
be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians </s>
<s>  this she would not hear of </s>
<s>  but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal </s>
<s>  and it was settled
that <abvr> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet
were not decidedly better </s>
<s>  bingley was quite uncomfortable </s>
<s>  his sisters
declared that they were miserable </s>
<s>  they solaced their wretchedness
however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from <abvr> bingley by a housemaid
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters </s>
<s>  in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her
own judgement of her situation </s>
<s>  the note was immediately dispatched and
its contents as quickly complied with </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet accompanied by her
two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast </s>
<s> 

had she found jane in any apparent danger <abvr> bennet would have been
very miserable </s>
<s>  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield </s>
<s>  she
would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried
home </s>
<s>  neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think
it at all advisable </s>
<s>  after sitting a little while with jane on miss
bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour </s>
<s>  bingley met them with hopes
that <abvr> bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected </s>
<s> 

indeed i have sir was her answer </s>
<s>  she is a great deal too ill to be
moved </s>
<s>  <abvr> jones says we must not think of moving her </s>
<s>  we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness </s>
<s> 

removed </s>
<s>  cried bingley </s>
<s>  it must not be thought of </s>
<s>  my sister i am
sure will not hear of her removal </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility
that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments </s>
<s> 

i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers
a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest
temper i have ever met with </s>
<s>  i often tell my other girls they are
nothing to her </s>
<s>  you have a sweet room here <abvr> bingley and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk </s>
<s>  i do not know a place in the
country that is equal to netherfield </s>
<s>  you will not think of quitting it
in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease </s>
<s> 

whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he </s>
<s>  and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five
minutes </s>
<s>  at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth </s>
<s> 

you begin to comprehend me do you </s>
<s>  cried he turning towards her </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesi understand you perfectly </s>
<s> 

i wish i might take this for a compliment </s>
<s>  but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful </s>
<s> 

that is as it happens </s>
<s>  it does not follow that a deep intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours </s>
<s> 

lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home </s>
<s> 

i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a
studier of character </s>
<s>  it must be an amusing study </s>
<s> 

yes but intricate characters are the most amusing </s>
<s>  they have at
least that advantage </s>
<s> 

the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study </s>
<s>  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society </s>
<s> 

but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever </s>
<s> 

yes indeed cried <abvr> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood </s>
<s>  i assure you there is quite as much of that
going on in the country as in town </s>
<s> 

everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment
turned silently away </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him continued her triumph </s>
<s> 

i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part except the shops and public places </s>
<s>  the country is a vast deal
pleasanter is it not <abvr> bingley </s>
<s> 

when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it </s>
<s> 
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same </s>
<s>  they have each their
advantages and i can be equally happy in either </s>
<s> 

ayethat is because you have the right disposition </s>
<s>  but that
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing
at all </s>
<s> 

indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her
mother </s>
<s>  you quite mistook <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town
which you must acknowledge to be true </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear nobody said there were </s>
<s>  but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger </s>
<s>  i know we dine with fourandtwenty families </s>
<s> 

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance </s>
<s>  his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards
mr </s>
<s>  darcy with a very expressive smile </s>
<s>  elizabeth for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away </s>
<s> 

yes she called yesterday with her father </s>
<s>  what an agreeable man sir
william is <abvr> bingley is not he </s>
<s>  so much the man of fashion </s>
<s>  so
genteel and easy </s>
<s>  he has always something to say to everybody </s>
<s>  that
is my idea of good breeding </s>
<s>  and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter </s>
<s> 

did charlotte dine with you </s>
<s> 

no she would go home </s>
<s>  i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies </s>
<s>  for
my part <abvr> bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work </s>
<s> 
my daughters are brought up very differently </s>
<s>  but everybody is to
judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls
i assure you </s>
<s>  it is a pity they are not handsome </s>
<s>  not that i think
charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend </s>
<s> 

she seems a very pleasant young woman </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear yes </s>
<s>  but you must own she is very plain </s>
<s>  lady lucas herself
has often said so and envied me janes beauty </s>
<s>  i do not like to boast
of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody
better looking </s>
<s>  it is what everybody says </s>
<s>  i do not trust my own
partiality </s>
<s>  when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother
gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away </s>
<s>  but however he
did not </s>
<s>  perhaps he thought her too young </s>
<s>  however he wrote some verses
on her and very pretty they were </s>
<s> 

and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently </s>
<s>  there has
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way </s>
<s>  i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love </s>
<s> 

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy </s>
<s> 

of a fine stout healthy love it may </s>
<s>  everything nourishes what is
strong already </s>
<s>  but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away </s>
<s> 

darcy only smiled </s>
<s>  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again </s>
<s>  she longed to
speak but could think of nothing to say </s>
<s>  and after a short silence <abvr>
bennet began repeating her thanks to <abvr> bingley for his kindness to
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be
civil also and say what the occasion required </s>
<s>  she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness but <abvr> bennet was satisfied and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage </s>
<s>  upon this signal the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward </s>
<s>  the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the
youngest should tax <abvr> bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield </s>
<s> 

lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion
and goodhumoured countenance </s>
<s>  a favourite with her mother whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age </s>
<s>  she had high
animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the
attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance </s>
<s>  she was very
equal therefore to address <abvr> bingley on the subject of the ball and
abruptly reminded him of his promise </s>
<s>  adding that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it </s>
<s>  his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement </s>
<s>  and when
your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball </s>
<s>  but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill </s>
<s> 

lydia declared herself satisfied </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  yesit would be much better to
wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again </s>
<s>  and when you have given your ball she
added i shall insist on their giving one also </s>
<s>  i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  the latter of whom however
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of
all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the day passed much as the day before had done </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who
continued though slowly to mend </s>
<s>  and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawingroom </s>
<s>  the lootable however did not appear </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and <abvr> bingley were at piquet and
mrs </s>
<s>  hurst was observing their game </s>
<s> 

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion </s>
<s>  the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each </s>
<s> 

how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter </s>
<s> 

he made no answer </s>
<s> 

you write uncommonly fast </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken </s>
<s>  i write rather slowly </s>
<s> 

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year </s>
<s>  letters of business too </s>
<s>  how odious i should think them </s>
<s> 

it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours </s>
<s> 

pray tell your sister that i long to see her </s>
<s> 

i have already told her so once by your desire </s>
<s> 

i am afraid you do not like your pen </s>
<s>  let me mend it for you </s>
<s>  i mend
pens remarkably well </s>
<s> 

thank youbut i always mend my own </s>
<s> 

how can you contrive to write so even </s>
<s> 

he was silent </s>
<s> 

tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp </s>
<s> 
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantleys </s>
<s> 

will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again </s>
<s>  at
present i have not room to do them justice </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  it is of no consequence </s>
<s>  i shall see her in january </s>
<s>  but do you
always write such charming long letters to her <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

they are generally long </s>
<s>  but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine </s>
<s> 

it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill </s>
<s> 

that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her
brother because he does not write with ease </s>
<s>  he studies too much for
words of four syllables </s>
<s>  do not you darcy </s>
<s> 

my style of writing is very different from yours </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable </s>
<s>  he leaves out half his words and blots the rest </s>
<s> 

my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents </s>
<s> 

your humility <abvr> bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof </s>
<s> 

nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of
humility </s>
<s>  it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an
indirect boast </s>
<s> 

and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty </s>
<s> 

the indirect boast </s>
<s>  for you are really proud of your defects in
writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you
think at least highly interesting </s>
<s>  the power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance </s>
<s>  when you told <abvr>
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else </s>
<s> 

nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning </s>
<s>  and yet upon my honour
i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this
moment </s>
<s>  at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies </s>
<s> 

i dare say you believed it </s>
<s>  but i am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity </s>
<s>  your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know </s>
<s>  and if as you were
mounting your horse a friend were to say ˜bingley you had better
stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not
goand at another word might stay a month </s>
<s> 

you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <abvr> bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition </s>
<s>  you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself </s>
<s> 

i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper </s>
<s>  but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend </s>
<s>  for he would certainly think better of me if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
could </s>
<s> 

would <abvr> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it </s>
<s> 

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter </s>
<s>  darcy must speak for
himself </s>
<s> 

you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine
but which i have never acknowledged </s>
<s>  allowing the case however to
stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and
the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety </s>
<s> 

to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit
with you </s>
<s> 

to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either </s>
<s> 

you appear to me <abvr> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection </s>
<s>  a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it </s>
<s>  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  we may as well wait perhaps till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon </s>
<s>  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire without waiting to be argued into it </s>
<s> 

will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties </s>
<s> 

by all means cried bingley </s>
<s>  let us hear all the particulars not
forgetting their comparative height and size </s>
<s>  for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of </s>
<s>  i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with
myself i should not pay him half so much deference </s>
<s>  i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in
particular places </s>
<s>  at his own house especially and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy smiled </s>
<s>  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh </s>
<s>  miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense </s>
<s> 

i see your design bingley said his friend </s>
<s>  you dislike an argument
and want to silence this </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do </s>
<s>  arguments are too much like disputes </s>
<s>  if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very
thankful </s>
<s>  and then you may say whatever you like of me </s>
<s> 

what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
darcy had much better finish his letter </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy took her advice and did finish his letter </s>
<s> 

when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music </s>
<s>  miss bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte </s>
<s>  and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she
seated herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks
that lay on the instrument how frequently <abvr> darcys eyes were fixed
on her </s>
<s>  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man </s>
<s>  and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her was still more strange </s>
<s>  she could only imagine
however at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in
any other person present </s>
<s>  the supposition did not pain her </s>
<s>  she liked
him too little to care for his approbation </s>
<s> 

after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by
a lively scotch air </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards <abvr> darcy drawing near
elizabeth said to her </s>
<s> 

do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel </s>
<s> 

she smiled but made no answer </s>
<s>  he repeated the question with some
surprise at her silence </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said she i heard you before but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply </s>
<s>  you wanted me i know to say ˜yes
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste </s>
<s>  but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt </s>
<s>  i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if
you dare </s>
<s> 

indeed i do not dare </s>
<s> 

elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his
gallantry </s>
<s>  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody </s>
<s>  and darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her </s>
<s>  he really
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he
should be in some danger </s>
<s> 

miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous </s>
<s>  and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth </s>
<s> 

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance </s>
<s> 

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this
desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue </s>
<s> 
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after
officers </s>
<s>  and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence
which your lady possesses </s>
<s> 

have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley </s>
<s>  put them next to your greatuncle the
judge </s>
<s>  they are in the same profession you know only in different
lines </s>
<s>  as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes </s>
<s> 

it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their
colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be
copied </s>
<s> 

at that moment they were met from another walk by <abvr> hurst and
elizabeth herself </s>
<s> 

i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some
confusion lest they had been overheard </s>
<s> 

you used us abominably ill answered <abvr> hurst running away without
telling us that you were coming out </s>
<s> 

then taking the disengaged arm of <abvr> darcy she left elizabeth to walk
by herself </s>
<s>  the path just admitted three </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said </s>
<s> 

this walk is not wide enough for our party </s>
<s>  we had better go into the
avenue </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them
laughingly answered </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  stay where you are </s>
<s>  you are charmingly grouped and appear
to uncommon advantage </s>
<s>  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s> 

she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two </s>
<s>  jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening </s>

chapter 


when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her
sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the
drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure </s>
<s>  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared </s>
<s> 
their powers of conversation were considerable </s>
<s>  they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit </s>
<s> 

but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object </s>
<s> 
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps </s>
<s>  he addressed
himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst also
made her a slight bow and said he was very glad </s>
<s>  but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation </s>
<s>  he was full of joy and
attention </s>
<s>  the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she
should suffer from the change of room </s>
<s>  and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from
the door </s>
<s>  he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone
else </s>
<s>  elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great
delight </s>
<s> 

when tea was over <abvr> hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the
cardtablebut in vain </s>
<s>  she had obtained private intelligence that <abvr>
darcy did not wish for cards </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected </s>
<s>  she assured him that no one intended to play and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her </s>
<s>  <abvr>
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep </s>
<s>  darcy took up a book </s>
<s>  miss bingley did the same </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss
bennet </s>
<s> 

miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching <abvr>
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own </s>
<s>  and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page </s>
<s>  she
could not win him however to any conversation </s>
<s>  he merely answered her
question and read on </s>
<s>  at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way </s>
<s>  i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading </s>
<s>  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book </s>
<s>  when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library </s>
<s> 

no one made any reply </s>
<s>  she then yawned again threw aside her book and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement </s>
<s>  when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly
towards him and said </s>
<s> 

by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield </s>
<s>  i would advise you before you determine on it to consult
the wishes of the present party </s>
<s>  i am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure </s>
<s> 

if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he
chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled
thing </s>
<s>  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
round my cards </s>
<s> 

i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were
carried on in a different manner </s>
<s>  but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting </s>
<s>  it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day </s>
<s> 

much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be
near so much like a ball </s>
<s> 

miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room </s>
<s>  her figure was elegant and she walked well </s>
<s>  but
darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious </s>
<s>  in
the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and
turning to elizabeth said </s>
<s> 

miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a
turn about the room </s>
<s>  i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately </s>
<s>  miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy looked
up </s>
<s>  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book </s>
<s>  he was
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere </s>
<s>  what could he mean </s>
<s>  she was dying to know what could be his
meaning </s>
<s> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him </s>
<s> 

not at all was her answer </s>
<s>  but depend upon it he means to be severe
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it </s>
<s> 

miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <abvr> darcy in
anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives </s>
<s> 

i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon
as she allowed him to speak </s>
<s>  you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking </s>
<s>  if the first i would be
completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  shocking </s>
<s>  cried miss bingley </s>
<s>  i never heard anything so
abominable </s>
<s>  how shall we punish him for such a speech </s>
<s> 

nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth </s>
<s>  we
can all plague and punish one another </s>
<s>  tease himlaugh at him </s>
<s>  intimate
as you are you must know how it is to be done </s>
<s> 

but upon my honour i do not </s>
<s>  i do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me that </s>
<s>  tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s>  i feel he may defy us there </s>
<s>  and as to laughter we will
not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a
subject </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy may hug himself </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy is not to be laughed at </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  that is an
uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances </s>
<s>  i dearly love a
laugh </s>
<s> 

miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be </s>
<s> 
the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their
actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke </s>
<s> 

certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i
am not one of them </s>
<s>  i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good </s>
<s> 
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own
and i laugh at them whenever i can </s>
<s>  but these i suppose are precisely
what you are without </s>
<s> 

perhaps that is not possible for anyone </s>
<s>  but it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule </s>
<s> 

such as vanity and pride </s>
<s> 

yes vanity is a weakness indeed </s>
<s>  but pridewhere there is a real
superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation </s>
<s> 

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile </s>
<s> 

your examination of <abvr> darcy is over i presume said miss bingley </s>
<s> 
and pray what is the result </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly convinced by it that <abvr> darcy has no defect </s>
<s>  he owns it
himself without disguise </s>
<s> 

no said darcy i have made no such pretension </s>
<s>  i have faults enough
but they are not i hope of understanding </s>
<s>  my temper i dare not vouch
for </s>
<s>  it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the
convenience of the world </s>
<s>  i cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself </s>
<s>  my feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them </s>
<s>  my temper
would perhaps be called resentful </s>
<s>  my good opinion once lost is lost
forever </s>
<s> 

that is a failing indeed </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  implacable resentment
is a shade in a character </s>
<s>  but you have chosen your fault well </s>
<s>  i
really cannot laugh at it </s>
<s>  you are safe from me </s>
<s> 

there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evila natural defect which not even the best education can overcome </s>
<s> 

and your defect is to hate everybody </s>
<s> 

and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand
them </s>
<s> 

do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a
conversation in which she had no share </s>
<s>  louisa you will not mind my
waking <abvr> hurst </s>
<s> 

her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was
opened </s>
<s>  and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for
it </s>
<s>  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention </s>
<s> 



chapter 


in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which
would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before </s>
<s>  her answer therefore was not propitious at
least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday </s>
<s>  and in her postscript it was added that if <abvr> bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them
very well </s>
<s>  against staying longer however elizabeth was positively
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked </s>
<s>  and fearful on the
contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long
she urged jane to borrow <abvr> bingleys carriage immediately and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned and the request made </s>
<s> 

the communication excited many professions of concern </s>
<s>  and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on jane </s>
<s>  and till the morrow their going was deferred </s>
<s>  miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other </s>
<s> 

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for herthat she was not enough recovered </s>
<s>  but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough </s>
<s>  she attracted him more than he likedand miss
bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself </s>
<s> 
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity </s>
<s>  sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it </s>
<s>  steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were
at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her </s>
<s> 

on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost
all took place </s>
<s>  miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly as well as her affection for jane </s>
<s>  and when they parted
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most
tenderly she even shook hands with the former </s>
<s>  elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits </s>
<s> 

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again </s>
<s>  but their
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really
glad to see them </s>
<s>  he had felt their importance in the family circle </s>
<s>  the
evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of
its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and
elizabeth </s>

nature </s>

chapter 


i hope my dear said <abvr> bennet to his wife as they were at
breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today

<s> 

it is not <abvr> bingley said her husband </s>
<s>  it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life </s>
<s> 

this roused a general astonishment </s>
<s>  and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once </s>
<s> 

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained </s>
<s> 

about a month ago i received this letter </s>
<s>  and about a fortnight ago
i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring
early attention </s>
<s>  it is from my cousin <abvr> collins who when i am dead
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned </s>
<s> 
pray do not talk of that odious man </s>
<s>  i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children </s>
<s>  and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it </s>
<s> 

jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail </s>
<s>  they
had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about </s>
<s> 

it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said <abvr> bennet and
nothing can clear <abvr> collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn </s>
<s> 
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself </s>
<s> 

no that i am sure i shall not </s>
<s>  and i think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all and very hypocritical </s>
<s>  i hate such false
friends </s>
<s>  why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did
before him </s>
<s> 

why indeed </s>
<s>  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head as you will hear </s>
<s>

<s> 

dear sir

the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the
misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach </s>
<s>  but
for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance </s>
<s> ˜there <abvr>
bennet </s>
<s> my mind however is now made up on the subject for having
received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de
bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the church of england </s>
<s>  as a clergyman moreover i
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence </s>
<s>  and on these grounds i
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the
offered olivebranch </s>
<s>  i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for
it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amendsbut of this hereafter </s>
<s>  if you should have no objection to
receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight
following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day </s>
<s> i
remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters your wellwisher and friend

william collins

at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman
 said <abvr> bennet as he folded up the letter </s>
<s>  he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again </s>
<s> 

there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if
he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to
discourage him </s>
<s> 

though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his
credit </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required </s>
<s> 

he must be an oddity i think said she </s>
<s>  i cannot make him
out </s>
<s> there is something very pompous in his style </s>
<s> and what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail </s>
<s> we cannot suppose he
would help it if he could </s>
<s> could he be a sensible man sir </s>
<s> 

no my dear i think not </s>
<s>  i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse </s>
<s>  there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his
letter which promises well </s>
<s>  i am impatient to see him </s>
<s> 

in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem
defective </s>
<s>  the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet i
think it is well expressed </s>
<s> 

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting </s>
<s>  it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour </s>
<s>  as for
their mother <abvr> collinss letter had done away much of her illwill
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins was punctual to his time and was received with great
politeness by the whole family </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet indeed said little </s>
<s>  but the
ladies were ready enough to talk and <abvr> collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself </s>
<s>  he was a
tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty </s>
<s>  his air was grave and
stately and his manners were very formal </s>
<s>  he had not been long seated
before he complimented <abvr> bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters </s>
<s>  said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth </s>
<s>  and added that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage </s>
<s>  this
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily </s>
<s> 

you are very kind i am sure </s>
<s>  and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so for else they will be destitute enough </s>
<s>  things are settled so
oddly </s>
<s> 

you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  sir i do indeed </s>
<s>  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you
must confess </s>
<s>  not that i mean to find fault with you for such things
i know are all chance in this world </s>
<s>  there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed </s>
<s> 

i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate </s>
<s>  but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them </s>
<s>  at present i will not say more </s>

other </s>

<s>  the
hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised </s>

heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property </s>

cooking was owing </s>

chapter 


during dinner <abvr> bennet scarcely spoke at all </s>
<s>  but when the servants
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness </s>
<s>  lady
catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for
his comfort appeared very remarkable </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could not have chosen
better </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was eloquent in her praise </s>
<s>  the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine </s>
<s>  she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her </s>
<s>  she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings
and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening </s>
<s>  lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her </s>
<s> 
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman </s>
<s>  she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations </s>
<s>  she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion </s>
<s>  and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs </s>
<s> 

that is all very proper and civil i am sure said <abvr> bennet and
i dare say she is a very agreeable woman </s>
<s>  it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her </s>
<s>  does she live near you sir </s>
<s> 

the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park her ladyships residence </s>
<s> 

i think you said she was a widow sir </s>
<s>  has she any family </s>
<s> 

she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very
extensive property </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bennet shaking her head then she is better off than
many girls </s>
<s>  and what sort of young lady is she </s>
<s>  is she handsome </s>
<s> 

she is a most charming young lady indeed </s>
<s>  lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth </s>
<s>  she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still
resides with them </s>
<s>  but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies </s>
<s> 

has she been presented </s>
<s>  i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court </s>
<s> 

her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town </s>
<s> 
and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the
british court of its brightest ornament </s>
<s>  her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea </s>
<s>  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies </s>
<s>  i have more than once observed to lady catherine that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by
her </s>
<s>  these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay </s>
<s> 

you judge very properly said <abvr> bennet and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy </s>
<s>  may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment or are the result of previous study </s>
<s> 

they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennets expectations were fully answered </s>
<s>  his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner
in his pleasure </s>
<s> 

by teatime however the dose had been enough and <abvr> bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins readily
assented and a book was produced </s>
<s>  but on beholding it for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and
begging pardon protested that he never read novels </s>
<s>  kitty stared at
him and lydia exclaimed </s>
<s>  other books were produced and after some
deliberation he chose fordyces sermons </s>
<s>  lydia gaped as he opened the
volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three
pages she interrupted him with </s>
<s> 

do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away
richard </s>
<s>  and if he does colonel forster will hire him </s>
<s>  my aunt told me
so herself on saturday </s>
<s>  i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more
about it and to ask when <abvr> denny comes back from town </s>
<s> 

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
collins much offended laid aside his book and said </s>
<s> 

i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit </s>
<s>  it amazes
me i confess </s>
<s>  for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction </s>
<s>  but i will no longer importune my young cousin </s>
<s> 

then turning to <abvr> bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would
resume his book </s>
<s>  but <abvr> collins after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront seated himself at another table with <abvr> bennet and prepared
for backgammon </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society </s>
<s>  the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father </s>
<s>  and though he belonged to one of the universities he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance </s>
<s>  the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner </s>
<s>  but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity </s>
<s>  a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant </s>
<s>  and the respect which
he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a
clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility </s>
<s> 

having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to
marry </s>
<s>  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report </s>
<s> 
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers
estate </s>
<s>  and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part </s>
<s> 

his plan did not vary on seeing them </s>
<s>  miss bennets lovely face
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority </s>
<s>  and for the first evening she was his settled
choice </s>
<s>  the next morning however made an alteration </s>
<s>  for in a
quarter of an hours teteatete with <abvr> bennet before breakfast a
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at
longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on </s>
<s>  as to
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could
not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession </s>
<s>  her
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her
to hint was likely to be very soon engaged </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon
donedone while <abvr> bennet was stirring the fire </s>
<s>  elizabeth equally
next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married </s>
<s>  and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces </s>
<s> 

lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten </s>
<s>  every sister
except mary agreed to go with her </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collins was to attend them
at the request of <abvr> bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him
and have his library to himself </s>
<s>  for thither <abvr> collins had followed
him after breakfast </s>
<s>  and there he would continue nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to <abvr>
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford </s>
<s>  such
doings discomposed <abvr> bennet exceedingly </s>
<s>  in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity </s>
<s>  and though prepared as he told
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house he was used to be free from them there </s>
<s>  his civility therefore
was most prompt in inviting <abvr> collins to join his daughters in their
walk </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go </s>
<s> 

in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton </s>
<s>  the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him </s>
<s>  their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in
a shop window could recall them </s>
<s> 

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking
with another officer on the other side of the way </s>
<s>  the officer was
the very <abvr> denny concerning whose return from london lydia came
to inquire and he bowed as they passed </s>
<s>  all were struck with the
strangers air all wondered who he could be </s>
<s>  and kitty and lydia
determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had
reached the same spot </s>
<s>  <abvr> denny addressed them directly and entreated
permission to introduce his friend <abvr> wickham who had returned with
him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps </s>
<s>  this was exactly as it should be </s>
<s>  for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming </s>
<s> 
his appearance was greatly in his favour </s>
<s>  he had all the best part of
beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address </s>
<s> 
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming </s>
<s>  and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy
and bingley were seen riding down the street </s>
<s>  on distinguishing the
ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and
began the usual civilities </s>
<s>  bingley was the principal spokesman and
miss bennet the principal object </s>
<s>  he was then he said on his way to
longbourn on purpose to inquire after her </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy corroborated
it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting </s>
<s> 
both changed colour one looked white the other red </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham
after a few moments touched his hata salutation which <abvr> darcy just
deigned to return </s>
<s>  what could be the meaning of it </s>
<s>  it was impossible to
imagine </s>
<s>  it was impossible not to long to know </s>
<s> 

in another minute <abvr> bingley but without seeming to have noticed what
passed took leave and rode on with his friend </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  denny and <abvr> wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr </s>
<s>  phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias
pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of
mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  phillips was always glad to see her nieces </s>
<s>  and the two eldest
from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as
their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing
about if she had not happened to see <abvr> joness shopboy in the
street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility
was claimed towards <abvr> collins by janes introduction of him </s>
<s>  she
received him with her very best politeness which he returned with
as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous
acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself
however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice </s>
<s>  <abvr> phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding </s>
<s>  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other </s>
<s>  of whom
however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that
mr </s>
<s>  denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a
lieutenants commission in the shire </s>
<s>  she had been watching him the
last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had <abvr>
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid
disagreeable fellows </s>
<s>  some of them were to dine with the phillipses
the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on <abvr>
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening </s>
<s>  this was agreed to and <abvr> phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards </s>
<s>  the prospect of such
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless </s>
<s> 

as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen </s>
<s>  but though jane would have defended either
or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins on his return highly gratified <abvr> bennet by admiring
mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss manners and politeness </s>
<s>  he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman </s>
<s> 
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although
utterly unknown to her before </s>
<s>  something he supposed might be
attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life </s>
<s> 



chapter 


as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their
aunt and all <abvr> collinss scruples of leaving <abvr> and <abvr> bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton </s>
<s>  and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom
that <abvr> wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in
the house </s>
<s> 

when this information was given and they had all taken their seats <abvr>
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at rosings </s>
<s>  a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification </s>
<s>  but when <abvr> phillips understood from him what
rosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all
the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeepers room </s>
<s> 

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and
the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them </s>
<s>  and he found in <abvr> phillips a very attentive
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could </s>
<s>  to the girls who could not listen to their cousin
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the
interval of waiting appeared very long </s>
<s>  it was over at last however </s>
<s> 
the gentlemen did approach and when <abvr> wickham walked into the room
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration </s>
<s> 
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and
walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips
breathing port wine who followed them into the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself </s>
<s>  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel
that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker </s>
<s> 

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as <abvr> wickham and the
officers <abvr> collins seemed to sink into insignificance </s>
<s>  to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing </s>
<s>  but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in <abvr> phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin </s>
<s>  when the cardtables were placed he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist </s>
<s> 

i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad
to improve myself for in my situation in life <abvr> phillips was very
glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia </s>
<s>  at first there
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most
determined talker </s>
<s>  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular </s>
<s> 
allowing for the common demands of the game <abvr> wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear
him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
toldthe history of his acquaintance with <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  she dared not
even mention that gentleman </s>
<s>  her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham began the subject himself </s>
<s>  he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton </s>
<s>  and after receiving her answer asked in
a hesitating manner how long <abvr> darcy had been staying there </s>
<s> 

about a month said elizabeth </s>
<s>  and then unwilling to let the subject
drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i
understand </s>
<s> 

yes replied <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  his estate there is a noble one </s>
<s>  a clear
ten thousand per annum </s>
<s>  you could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for
i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not but look surprised </s>
<s> 

you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after
seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday </s>
<s>  are you much acquainted with <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly </s>
<s>  i have
spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being
agreeable or otherwise </s>
<s>  i am not qualified to form one </s>
<s>  i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge </s>
<s>  it is impossible for me
to be impartial </s>
<s>  but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else </s>
<s>  here you are in your own family </s>
<s> 

upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in
the neighbourhood except netherfield </s>
<s>  he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire </s>
<s>  everybody is disgusted with his pride </s>
<s>  you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone </s>
<s> 

i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short
interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts </s>
<s>  but with him i believe it does not often happen </s>
<s>  the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen </s>
<s> 

i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an
illtempered man </s>
<s>  wickham only shook his head </s>
<s> 

i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer </s>
<s> 

i do not at all know </s>
<s>  but i heard nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield </s>
<s>  i hope your plans in favour of the shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  noit is not for me to be driven away by <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  if he
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go </s>
<s>  we are not on friendly terms
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for
avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense
of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he
is </s>
<s>  his father miss bennet the late <abvr> darcy was one of the best men
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had </s>
<s>  and i can never
be in company with this <abvr> darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections </s>
<s>  his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous </s>
<s>  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father </s>
<s> 

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with
all her heart </s>
<s>  but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry </s>
<s> 

it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire </s>
<s>  i knew it to be
a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them </s>
<s> 
society i own is necessary to me </s>
<s>  i have been a disappointed man and
my spirits will not bear solitude </s>
<s>  i must have employment and society </s>
<s> 
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have
now made it eligible </s>
<s>  the church ought to have been my professioni
was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

yesthe late <abvr> darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift </s>
<s>  he was my godfather and excessively attached to me </s>
<s> 
i cannot do justice to his kindness </s>
<s>  he meant to provide for me amply
and thought he had done it </s>
<s>  but when the living fell it was given
elsewhere </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  but how could that be </s>
<s>  how could his
will be disregarded </s>
<s>  why did you not seek legal redress </s>
<s> 

there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law </s>
<s>  a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention but <abvr> darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing </s>
<s>  certain
it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was
of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man </s>
<s>  and no
less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it </s>
<s>  i have a warm unguarded temper and
i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely </s>
<s>  i can
recall nothing worse </s>
<s>  but the fact is that we are very different sort
of men and that he hates me </s>
<s> 

this is quite shocking </s>
<s>  he deserves to be publicly disgraced </s>
<s> 

some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me </s>
<s>  till i
can forget his father i can never defy or expose him </s>
<s> 

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them </s>
<s> 

but what said she after a pause can have been his motive </s>
<s>  what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly </s>
<s> 

a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy </s>
<s>  had the late <abvr> darcy liked me
less his son might have borne with me better </s>
<s>  but his fathers uncommon
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life </s>
<s>  he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort
of preference which was often given me </s>
<s> 

i had not thought <abvr> darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked
him </s>
<s>  i had not thought so very ill of him </s>
<s>  i had supposed him to be
despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as
this </s>
<s> 

after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do
remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of
his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper </s>
<s>  his disposition
must be dreadful </s>
<s> 

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham </s>
<s>  i can hardly
be just to him </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his
father </s>
<s>  she could have added a young man too like you whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself
with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood
connected together as i think you said in the closest manner </s>
<s> 

we were born in the same parish within the same park </s>
<s>  the greatest
part of our youth was passed together </s>
<s>  inmates of the same house
sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care </s>
<s>  my
father began life in the profession which your uncle <abvr> phillips
appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of
use to the late <abvr> darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property </s>
<s>  he was most highly esteemed by <abvr> darcy a most
intimate confidential friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence
and when immediately before my fathers death <abvr> darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself </s>
<s> 

how strange </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  how abominable </s>
<s>  i wonder that the very
pride of this <abvr> darcy has not made him just to you </s>
<s>  if from no better
motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor
dishonesty i must call it </s>
<s> 

it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride </s>
<s>  and pride had often been his best friend </s>
<s>  it has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling </s>
<s>  but we are
none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride </s>
<s> 

can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money
freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the
poor </s>
<s>  family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of what
his father washave done this </s>
<s>  not to appear to disgrace his family
to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the
pemberley house is a powerful motive </s>
<s>  he has also brotherly pride
which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers </s>
<s> 

what sort of girl is miss darcy </s>
<s> 

he shook his head </s>
<s>  i wish i could call her amiable </s>
<s>  it gives me pain to
speak ill of a darcy </s>
<s>  but she is too much like her brothervery very
proud </s>
<s>  as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond
of me </s>
<s>  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement </s>
<s>  but she is
nothing to me now </s>
<s>  she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen
and i understand highly accomplished </s>
<s>  since her fathers death her
home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her
education </s>
<s> 

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first and saying </s>
<s> 

i am astonished at his intimacy with <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  how can <abvr> bingley
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable
be in friendship with such a man </s>
<s>  how can they suit each other </s>
<s>  do you
know <abvr> bingley </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s> 

he is a sweettempered amiable charming man </s>
<s>  he cannot know what <abvr>
darcy is </s>
<s> 

probably not </s>
<s>  but <abvr> darcy can please where he chooses </s>
<s>  he does not
want abilities </s>
<s>  he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while </s>
<s>  among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous </s>
<s>  his
pride never deserts him </s>
<s>  but with the rich he is liberalminded just
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something
for fortune and figure </s>
<s> 

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round
the other table and <abvr> collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and <abvr> phillips </s>
<s>  the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter </s>
<s>  it had not been very great </s>
<s>  he had lost every
point </s>
<s>  but when <abvr> phillips began to express her concern thereupon
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy </s>
<s> 

i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a
cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object </s>
<s>  there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams attention was caught </s>
<s>  and after observing <abvr> collins for
a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh </s>
<s> 

lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him
a living </s>
<s>  i hardly know how <abvr> collins was first introduced to her
notice but he certainly has not known her long </s>
<s> 

you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters </s>
<s>  consequently that she is aunt to the present <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

no indeed i did not </s>
<s>  i knew nothing at all of lady catherines
connections </s>
<s>  i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday </s>
<s> 

her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates </s>
<s> 

this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss
bingley </s>
<s>  vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already
selfdestined for another </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter </s>
<s>  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his
patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman </s>
<s> 

i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham </s>
<s>  i have
not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked
her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent </s>
<s>  she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever </s>
<s>  but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her
nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class </s>
<s> 

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of <abvr>
wickhams attentions </s>
<s>  there could be no conversation in the noise
of <abvr> phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to
everybody </s>
<s>  whatever he said was said well </s>

gracefully </s>
<s>  elizabeth went away with her head full of him </s>
<s>  she could
think of nothing but of <abvr> wickham and of what he had told her all
the way home </s>
<s>  but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went for neither lydia nor <abvr> collins were once silent </s>
<s>  lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collins in describing the civility of <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses

chapter 


elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between <abvr>
wickham and herself </s>
<s>  jane listened with astonishment and concern </s>
<s>  she
knew not how to believe that <abvr> darcy could be so unworthy of <abvr>
bingleys regard </s>
<s>  and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham </s>
<s>  the
possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings </s>
<s>  and nothing remained therefore to be
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained </s>
<s> 

they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way
or other of which we can form no idea </s>
<s>  interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other </s>
<s>  it is in short impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them
without actual blame on either side </s>
<s> 

very true indeed </s>
<s>  and now my dear jane what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business </s>
<s>  do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody </s>
<s> 

laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion </s>
<s>  my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places <abvr> darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such
a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for </s>
<s>  it is
impossible </s>
<s>  no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his
character could be capable of it </s>
<s>  can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 

i can much more easily believe <abvr> bingleys being imposed on than
that <abvr> wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night </s>
<s>  names facts everything mentioned without ceremony </s>
<s>  if it
be not so let <abvr> darcy contradict it </s>
<s>  besides there was truth in his
looks </s>
<s> 

it is difficult indeedit is distressing </s>
<s>  one does not know what to
think </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon </s>
<s>  one knows exactly what to think </s>
<s> 

but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat <abvr> bingley
if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair
became public </s>
<s> 

the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed
for the following tuesday </s>
<s>  the two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation </s>
<s>  to
the rest of the family they paid little attention </s>
<s>  avoiding <abvr> bennet
as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to
the others </s>
<s>  they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from <abvr> bennets civilities </s>
<s> 

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from <abvr> bingley himself instead of a
ceremonious card </s>
<s>  jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <abvr>
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in <abvr> darcys look
and behaviour </s>
<s>  the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
less on any single event or any particular person for though they
each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with <abvr> wickham
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball
was at any rate a ball </s>
<s>  and even mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it </s>
<s> 

while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements </s>
<s> 
society has claims on us all </s>
<s>  and i profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody </s>
<s> 

elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to <abvr> collins she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept <abvr> bingleys invitation and if
he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings
amusement </s>
<s>  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to
dance </s>
<s> 

i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball
of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people
can have any evil tendency </s>
<s>  and i am so far from objecting to dancing
myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially
a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause and not to any disrespect for her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in </s>
<s>  she had fully proposed being
engaged by <abvr> wickham for those very dances </s>
<s>  and to have <abvr> collins
instead </s>
<s>  her liveliness had never been worse timed </s>
<s>  there was no help
for it however </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickhams happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer and <abvr> collinss proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could </s>
<s>  she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more </s>
<s>  it now first
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors </s>
<s> 
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity </s>
<s>  and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to her </s>
<s>  elizabeth however did not choose
to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins might never make the offer and
till he did it was useless to quarrel about him </s>
<s> 

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the
younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton
once </s>
<s>  no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very
shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy </s>
<s>  even elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and
monday endurable to kitty and lydia </s>
<s> 



chapter 


till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in
vain for <abvr> wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her </s>
<s>  the certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her </s>
<s>  she had dressed with more than
usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  but in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for <abvr> darcys
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers </s>
<s>  and though
this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who
told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before and was not yet returned </s>
<s>  adding with a significant smile
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here </s>
<s> 

this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make </s>
<s> 
attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham </s>
<s>  she
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away
with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to <abvr> bingley whose blind partiality provoked her </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour </s>
<s>  and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her
spirits </s>
<s>  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had
not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular
notice </s>
<s>  the first two dances however brought a return of distress </s>
<s> 
they were dances of mortification </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins awkward and solemn
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give </s>
<s>  the moment of her release from
him was ecstasy </s>
<s> 

she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked </s>
<s>  when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by <abvr> darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that
without knowing what she did she accepted him </s>
<s>  he walked away again
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind </s>
<s>  charlotte tried to console her </s>
<s> 

i dare say you will find him very agreeable </s>
<s> 

heaven forbid </s>
<s>  that would be the greatest misfortune of all </s>
<s>  to find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate </s>
<s>  do not wish me such an
evil </s>
<s> 

when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her
hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence </s>
<s>  elizabeth made no
answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <abvr> darcy and
reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding
it </s>
<s>  they stood for some time without speaking a word </s>
<s>  and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at
first was resolved not to break it </s>
<s>  till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made
some slight observation on the dance </s>
<s>  he replied and was again
silent </s>
<s>  after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time
with </s>
<s> it is your turn to say something now <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  i talked
about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples </s>
<s> 

he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  that reply will do for the present </s>
<s>  perhaps by and by i may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones </s>
<s>  but
now we may be silent </s>
<s> 

do you talk by rule then while you are dancing </s>
<s> 

sometimes </s>
<s>  one must speak a little you know </s>
<s>  it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together </s>
<s>  and yet for the advantage of
some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible </s>
<s> 

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine </s>
<s> 

both replied elizabeth archly </s>
<s>  for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds </s>
<s>  we are each of an unsocial
taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb </s>
<s> 

this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure
 said he </s>
<s>  how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say </s>
<s>  you
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly </s>
<s> 

i must not decide on my own performance </s>
<s> 

he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton </s>
<s>  she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just
been forming a new acquaintance </s>
<s> 

the effect was immediate </s>
<s>  a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself
for her own weakness could not go on </s>
<s>  at length darcy spoke and in a
constrained manner said <abvr> wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of
retaining them is less certain </s>
<s> 

he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life </s>
<s> 

darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject </s>
<s>  at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room </s>
<s>  but on perceiving <abvr>
darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner </s>
<s> 

i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir </s>
<s>  such very
superior dancing is not often seen </s>
<s>  it is evident that you belong to the
first circles </s>
<s>  allow me to say however that your fair partner does not
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated
especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at
her sister and bingley shall take place </s>
<s>  what congratulations will then
flow in </s>
<s>  i appeal to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> but let me not interrupt you sir </s>
<s>  you
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me </s>
<s> 

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy </s>
<s>  but sir
williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane who were dancing together </s>
<s>  recovering himself however shortly
he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of </s>
<s> 

i do not think we were speaking at all </s>
<s>  sir william could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves </s>
<s> 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we
are to talk of next i cannot imagine </s>
<s> 

what think you of books </s>
<s>  said he smiling </s>
<s> 

booksoh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  i am sure we never read the same or not with the same
feelings </s>
<s> 

i am sorry you think so </s>
<s>  but if that be the case there can at least be
no want of subject </s>
<s>  we may compare our different opinions </s>
<s> 

noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom </s>
<s>  my head is always full of
something else </s>
<s> 

the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it </s>
<s>  said he
with a look of doubt </s>
<s> 

yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say <abvr> darcy
that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was
unappeasable </s>
<s>  you are very cautious i suppose as to its being
created </s>
<s> 

i am said he with a firm voice </s>
<s> 

and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice </s>
<s> 

i hope not </s>
<s> 

it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion
to be secure of judging properly at first </s>
<s> 

may i ask to what these questions tend </s>
<s> 

merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring
to shake off her gravity </s>
<s>  i am trying to make it out </s>
<s> 

and what is your success </s>
<s> 

she shook her head </s>
<s>  i do not get on at all </s>
<s>  i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly </s>
<s> 

i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me </s>
<s>  and i could wish miss bennet that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either </s>
<s> 

but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another
opportunity </s>
<s> 

i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied </s>
<s> 
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence </s>
<s>  and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree
for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against
another </s>
<s> 

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her </s>
<s> 

so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham </s>
<s> 
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand
questions </s>
<s>  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among
his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late
mr </s>
<s>  darcys steward </s>
<s>  let me recommend you however as a friend not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions </s>
<s>  for as to <abvr> darcys
using him ill it is perfectly false </s>
<s>  for on the contrary he has
always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated
mr </s>
<s>  darcy in a most infamous manner </s>
<s>  i do not know the particulars but
i know very well that <abvr> darcy is not in the least to blame that he
cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way </s>
<s>  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it </s>
<s>  i pity you
miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt </s>
<s>  but really
considering his descent one could not expect much better </s>
<s> 

his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said
elizabeth angrily </s>
<s>  for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of <abvr> darcys steward and of that i can
assure you he informed me himself </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer </s>
<s> 
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant </s>
<s> 

insolent girl </s>
<s>  said elizabeth to herself </s>
<s>  you are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this </s>
<s>  i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <abvr>
darcy </s>
<s>  she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley </s>
<s>  jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening </s>
<s> 
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for
wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way
before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness </s>
<s> 

i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her
sisters what you have learnt about <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person </s>
<s>  in which case
you may be sure of my pardon </s>
<s> 

no replied jane i have not forgotten him </s>
<s>  but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley does not know the whole of
his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  but he will vouch for the good conduct
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that
mr </s>
<s>  wickham has deserved much less attention from <abvr> darcy than he has
received </s>
<s>  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters
mr </s>
<s>  wickham is by no means a respectable young man </s>
<s>  i am afraid he has
been very imprudent and has deserved to lose <abvr> darcys regard </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley does not know <abvr> wickham himself </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton </s>
<s> 

this account then is what he has received from <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  i am
satisfied </s>
<s>  but what does he say of the living </s>
<s> 

he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard
them from <abvr> darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to
him conditionally only </s>
<s> 

i have not a doubt of <abvr> bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly </s>
<s> 
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say </s>
<s>  but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as i did before </s>
<s> 

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment </s>
<s>  elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of <abvr>
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it </s>
<s>  on their being joined by <abvr> bingley himself elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas </s>
<s>  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied before <abvr> collins came up to them
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery </s>
<s> 

i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness </s>
<s>  i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady
catherine </s>
<s>  how wonderfully these sort of things occur </s>
<s>  who would have
thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly </s>
<s>  i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to
do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before </s>
<s>  my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology </s>
<s> 

you are not going to introduce yourself to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

indeed i am </s>
<s>  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier </s>
<s> 
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew </s>
<s>  it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight </s>
<s> 

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him
that <abvr> darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt </s>
<s>  that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side </s>
<s>  and that if it were it must belong to <abvr> darcy the superior in
consequence to begin the acquaintance </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she
ceased speaking replied thus </s>
<s> 

my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding </s>
<s>  but permit me to say that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity
and those which regulate the clergy </s>
<s>  for give me leave to observe that
i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained </s>
<s>  you must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to
perform what i look on as a point of duty </s>
<s>  pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself </s>
<s>  and with a low bow he left her to attack <abvr>
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident </s>
<s>  her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the
words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh </s>
<s>  it vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder and when at last <abvr> collins allowed him time
to speak replied with an air of distant civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins however
was not discouraged from speaking again and <abvr> darcys contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins then returned to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my
reception </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy seemed much pleased with the attention </s>
<s>  he answered
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily </s>
<s>  it was really a very
handsome thought </s>
<s>  upon the whole i am much pleased with him </s>
<s> 

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane </s>
<s>  she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow </s>
<s>  and she felt capable under such circumstances of
endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters </s>
<s>  her mothers thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to
venture near her lest she might hear too much </s>
<s>  when they sat down to
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other </s>
<s>  and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely
openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon
be married to <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  it was an animating subject and <abvr> bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match </s>
<s>  his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but
three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation </s>
<s>  and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do </s>
<s>  it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men </s>
<s>  and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked </s>
<s>  it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on
such occasions it is the etiquette </s>
<s>  but no one was less likely than <abvr>
bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life </s>
<s>  she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it </s>
<s> 

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers
words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper </s>
<s>  for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by <abvr> darcy who sat opposite to them </s>
<s>  her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical </s>
<s> 

what is <abvr> darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him </s>
<s>  i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing he may not like to hear </s>
<s> 

for heavens sake madam speak lower </s>
<s>  what advantage can it be for you
to offend <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing </s>
<s> 

nothing that she could say however had any influence </s>
<s>  her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone </s>
<s>  elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation </s>
<s>  she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at <abvr> darcy though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded </s>
<s>  for though he was not always looking at her mother she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her </s>
<s>  the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity </s>
<s> 

at length however <abvr> bennet had no more to say </s>
<s>  and lady lucas who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken </s>
<s>  elizabeth now began to revive </s>
<s>  but not long was the interval of
tranquillity </s>
<s>  for when supper was over singing was talked of and
she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty
preparing to oblige the company </s>
<s>  by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance
but in vain </s>
<s>  mary would not understand them </s>
<s>  such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song </s>
<s>  elizabeths
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close </s>
<s>  for mary on receiving amongst the thanks
of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another </s>
<s> 
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display </s>
<s>  her voice was
weak and her manner affected </s>
<s>  elizabeth was in agonies </s>
<s>  she looked at
jane to see how she bore it </s>
<s>  but jane was very composedly talking to
bingley </s>
<s>  she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs
of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however
imperturbably grave </s>
<s>  she looked at her father to entreat his
interference lest mary should be singing all night </s>
<s>  he took the hint
and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do
extremely well child </s>
<s>  you have delighted us long enough </s>
<s>  let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit </s>
<s> 

mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid
her anxiety had done no good </s>
<s>  others of the party were now applied to </s>
<s> 

if i said <abvr> collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i
should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an
air </s>
<s>  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman </s>
<s>  i do not mean however
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to </s>
<s>  the
rector of a parish has much to do </s>
<s>  in the first place he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron </s>
<s>  he must write his own sermons </s>
<s>  and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible </s>
<s>  and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment </s>
<s>  i cannot acquit
him of that duty </s>
<s>  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family </s>
<s>  and with a bow to <abvr> darcy he concluded his speech which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room </s>
<s>  many staredmany
smiled </s>
<s>  but no one looked more amused than <abvr> bennet himself while his
wife seriously commended <abvr> collins for having spoken so sensibly
and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably
clever good kind of young man </s>
<s> 

to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success </s>
<s>  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed </s>
<s>  that his two sisters and <abvr> darcy however should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable </s>
<s> 

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement </s>
<s>  she was teased by
mr </s>
<s>  collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her
power to dance with others </s>
<s>  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room </s>
<s> 
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it </s>
<s> 
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening </s>
<s>  there was no arguing upon such a project </s>
<s>  she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and
goodnaturedly engaged <abvr> collinss conversation to herself </s>
<s> 

she was at least free from the offense of <abvr> darcys further notice </s>
<s> 
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite
disengaged he never came near enough to speak </s>
<s>  she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to <abvr> wickham and rejoiced in
it </s>
<s> 

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by
a manoeuvre of <abvr> bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves </s>
<s>  they repulsed
every attempt of <abvr> bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of <abvr> collins who was complimenting <abvr> bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests </s>
<s>  darcy said
nothing at all </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest and talked only to each other </s>
<s>  elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either <abvr> hurst or miss bingley </s>
<s>  and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord
how tired i am </s>
<s>  accompanied by a violent yawn </s>
<s> 

when at length they arose to take leave <abvr> bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and
addressed herself especially to <abvr> bingley to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without
the ceremony of a formal invitation </s>
<s>  bingley was all grateful pleasure
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months </s>
<s>  of having another daughter married to <abvr> collins she thought
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure </s>
<s> 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children </s>
<s>  and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each
was eclipsed by <abvr> bingley and netherfield </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the next day opened a new scene at longbourn </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins made his
declaration in form </s>
<s>  having resolved to do it without loss of time as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business </s>
<s>  on
finding <abvr> bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together
soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words </s>
<s> 

may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning </s>
<s> 

before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise <abvr>
bennet answered instantly oh dear </s>
<s> yescertainly </s>
<s>  i am sure lizzy
will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection </s>
<s>  come kitty i
want you up stairs </s>
<s>  and gathering her work together she was hastening
away when elizabeth called out </s>
<s> 

dear madam do not go </s>
<s>  i beg you will not go </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins must excuse
me </s>
<s>  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear </s>
<s>  i am
going away myself </s>
<s> 

no no nonsense lizzy </s>
<s>  i desire you to stay where you are </s>
<s>  and upon
elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to
escape she added </s>
<s>  lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing <abvr>
collins </s>
<s> 

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to
conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as
they were gone <abvr> collins began </s>
<s> 

believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections </s>
<s>  you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness </s>
<s>  but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mothers permission for this address </s>
<s>  you can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble </s>
<s>  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken </s>
<s>  almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of
my future life </s>
<s>  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife as i certainly did </s>
<s> 

the idea of <abvr> collins with all his solemn composure being run away
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further
and he continued </s>
<s> 

my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish </s>
<s>  secondly that i am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness </s>
<s>  and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought
to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness </s>
<s>  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked
too </s>
<s>  on this subject </s>
<s>  and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while <abvr> jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said ˜mr </s>
<s>  collins you
must marry </s>
<s>  a clergyman like you must marry </s>
<s>  choose properly choose
a gentlewoman for my sake </s>
<s>  and for your own let her be an active
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small
income go a good way </s>
<s>  this is my advice </s>
<s>  find such a woman as soon as
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her </s>
<s>  allow me by the
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice
and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer </s>
<s>  you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe </s>
<s>  and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite </s>
<s>  thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony </s>
<s>  it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i
can assure you there are many amiable young women </s>
<s>  but the fact is that
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not
be for several years </s>
<s>  this has been my motive my fair cousin and
i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem </s>
<s>  and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection </s>
<s>  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with </s>
<s>  and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to </s>
<s>  on that head
therefore i shall be uniformly silent </s>
<s>  and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married </s>
<s> 

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now </s>
<s> 

you are too hasty sir she cried </s>
<s>  you forget that i have made no
answer </s>
<s>  let me do it without further loss of time </s>
<s>  accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me </s>
<s>  i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them </s>
<s> 

i am not now to learn replied <abvr> collins with a formal wave of the
hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their
favour </s>
<s>  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time </s>
<s>  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long </s>
<s> 

upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration </s>
<s>  i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time </s>
<s>  i am perfectly serious in my refusal </s>
<s>  you could not make me
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
could make you so </s>
<s>  nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation </s>
<s> 

were it certain that lady catherine would think so said <abvr> collins
very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you </s>
<s>  and you may be certain when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty economy and other amiable qualification </s>
<s> 

indeed <abvr> collins all praise of me will be unnecessary </s>
<s>  you
must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment
of believing what i say </s>
<s>  i wish you very happy and very rich and by
refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise </s>
<s> 
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach </s>
<s>  this matter may
be considered therefore as finally settled </s>
<s>  and rising as she
thus spoke she would have quitted the room had <abvr> collins not thus
addressed her </s>
<s> 

when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me </s>
<s>  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character </s>
<s> 

really <abvr> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me
exceedingly </s>
<s>  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one </s>
<s> 

you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course </s>
<s>  my reasons for
believing it are briefly these </s>
<s>  it does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable </s>
<s>  my situation in life my connections
with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are
circumstances highly in my favour </s>
<s>  and you should take it into further
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you </s>
<s>  your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications </s>
<s>  as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me
i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females </s>
<s> 

i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man </s>
<s>  i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere </s>
<s>  i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but
to accept them is absolutely impossible </s>
<s>  my feelings in every respect
forbid it </s>
<s>  can i speak plainer </s>
<s>  do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking
the truth from her heart </s>
<s> 

you are uniformly charming </s>
<s>  cried he with an air of awkward
gallantry </s>
<s>  and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable </s>
<s> 

to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make
no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew </s>
<s>  determined if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character </s>
<s> 

this information however startled <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it
and could not help saying so </s>
<s> 

but depend upon it <abvr> collins she added that lizzy shall be
brought to reason </s>
<s>  i will speak to her about it directly </s>
<s>  she is a very
headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will
make her know it </s>
<s> 

pardon me for interrupting you madam cried <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  but if
she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state </s>
<s>  if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity </s>
<s> 

sir you quite misunderstand me said <abvr> bennet alarmed </s>
<s>  lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these </s>
<s>  in everything else she is as
goodnatured a girl as ever lived </s>
<s>  i will go directly to <abvr> bennet and
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure </s>
<s> 

she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her
husband called out as she entered the library oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet you
are wanted immediately </s>
<s>  we are all in an uproar </s>
<s>  you must come and make
lizzy marry <abvr> collins for she vows she will not have him and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication </s>
<s> 

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had
finished her speech </s>
<s>  of what are you talking </s>
<s> 

of <abvr> collins and lizzy </s>
<s>  lizzy declares she will not have <abvr> collins
and <abvr> collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy </s>
<s> 

and what am i to do on the occasion </s>
<s>  it seems an hopeless business </s>
<s> 

speak to lizzy about it yourself </s>
<s>  tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him </s>
<s> 

let her be called down </s>
<s>  she shall hear my opinion </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library </s>
<s> 

come here child cried her father as she appeared </s>
<s>  i have sent for
you on an affair of importance </s>
<s>  i understand that <abvr> collins has made
you an offer of marriage </s>
<s>  is it true </s>
<s>  elizabeth replied that it was </s>
<s> 
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused </s>
<s> 

i have sir </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  we now come to the point </s>
<s>  your mother insists upon your
accepting it </s>
<s>  is it not so <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

yes or i will never see her again </s>
<s> 

an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth </s>
<s>  from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents </s>
<s>  your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry <abvr> collins and i will never see you again
if you do </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning
but <abvr> bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished was excessively disappointed </s>
<s> 

what do you mean <abvr> bennet in talking this way </s>
<s>  you promised me to
insist upon her marrying him </s>
<s> 

my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request </s>
<s> 
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion </s>
<s>  and secondly of my room </s>
<s>  i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be </s>
<s> 

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet give up the point </s>
<s>  she talked to elizabeth again and again </s>
<s> 
coaxed and threatened her by turns </s>
<s>  she endeavoured to secure jane
in her interest </s>
<s>  but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering </s>
<s>  and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks </s>
<s>  though her manner
varied however her determination never did </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed </s>
<s> 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him </s>
<s>  and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other
way </s>
<s>  his regard for her was quite imaginary </s>
<s>  and the possibility of her
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret </s>
<s> 

while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them </s>
<s>  she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to
her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such
fun here </s>
<s>  what do you think has happened this morning </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins has
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him </s>
<s> 

charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty
who came to tell the same news </s>
<s>  and no sooner had they entered the
breakfastroom where <abvr> bennet was alone than she likewise began on
the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family </s>
<s>  pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone
for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me </s>
<s>  i am cruelly used
nobody feels for my poor nerves </s>
<s> 

charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth </s>
<s> 

aye there she comes continued <abvr> bennet looking as unconcerned
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided
she can have her own way </s>
<s>  but i tell you miss lizzyif you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead </s>
<s>  i shall not be able to keep
youand so i warn you </s>
<s>  i have done with you from this very day </s>
<s>  i told
you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again
and you will find me as good as my word </s>
<s>  i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children </s>
<s>  not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking
to anybody </s>
<s>  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking </s>
<s>  nobody can tell what i suffer </s>
<s>  but it
is always so </s>
<s>  those who do not complain are never pitied </s>
<s> 

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation </s>
<s>  she talked on therefore without interruption from any of
them till they were joined by <abvr> collins who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to
the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold
your tongues and let me and <abvr> collins have a little conversation
together </s>
<s> 

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could </s>
<s>  and charlotte
detained first by the civility of <abvr> collins whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little
curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear </s>
<s>  in a doleful voice <abvr> bennet began the projected
conversation </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 

my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point </s>
<s> 
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter </s>
<s>  resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all </s>
<s>  the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment </s>
<s> 
and i trust i am resigned </s>
<s>  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand </s>
<s> 
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation </s>
<s>  you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughters favour without having paid yourself and <abvr> bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf </s>
<s>  my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own </s>
<s>  but we are all
liable to error </s>
<s>  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair </s>
<s> 
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise </s>

chapter 


the discussion of <abvr> collinss offer was now nearly at an end and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother </s>
<s>  as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly
expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence </s>
<s>  he scarcely ever spoke
to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and
especially to her friend </s>
<s> 

the morrow produced no abatement of <abvr> bennets illhumour or ill
health </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was also in the same state of angry pride </s>
<s>  elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it </s>
<s>  he was always to have gone on
saturday and to saturday he meant to stay </s>
<s> 

after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if <abvr> wickham
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball </s>
<s> 
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was
well talked over </s>
<s>  to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed </s>
<s> 

i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet
mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  that to be in the same room the same party with him for so
many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself </s>
<s> 

she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to
her </s>
<s>  his accompanying them was a double advantage </s>
<s>  she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother </s>
<s> 

soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet </s>
<s>  it came
from netherfield </s>
<s>  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little
hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages </s>
<s>  jane recollected
herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation </s>
<s>  but elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham </s>
<s>  and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane
invited her to follow her up stairs </s>
<s>  when they had gained their own room
jane taking out the letter said </s>
<s> 

this is from caroline bingley </s>
<s>  what it contains has surprised me a good
deal </s>
<s>  the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on
their way to townand without any intention of coming back again </s>
<s>  you
shall hear what she says </s>
<s> 

she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly
and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where <abvr> hurst had a
house </s>
<s>  the next was in these words </s>
<s>  i do not pretend to regret anything
i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend </s>
<s> 
but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence </s>
<s>  i depend on you for that </s>
<s>  to these highflown
expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust </s>
<s> 
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw
nothing in it really to lament </s>
<s>  it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent <abvr> bingleys being there </s>
<s>  and as
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to
regard it in the enjoyment of his </s>
<s> 

it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country </s>
<s>  but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley will not be detained in london by
them </s>
<s> 

caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter </s>
<s>  i will read it to you </s>
<s> 

when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days </s>
<s>  but as we
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have
determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel </s>
<s>  many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter </s>
<s>  i wish that i could hear that you my
dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of
that i despair </s>
<s>  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you </s>
<s> 

it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this
winter </s>
<s> 

it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should </s>
<s> 

why will you think so </s>
<s>  it must be his own doing </s>
<s>  he is his own
master </s>
<s>  but you do not know all </s>
<s>  i will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me </s>
<s>  i will have no reserves from you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy is impatient to see his sister </s>
<s>  and to confess the truth
we are scarcely less eager to meet her again </s>
<s>  i really do not think
georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments </s>
<s> 
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister </s>
<s>  i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject </s>
<s>  but i will not leave the
country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable </s>
<s>  my brother admires her greatly already </s>
<s>  he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing </s>
<s> 
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own </s>
<s>  and a sisters
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most
capable of engaging any womans heart </s>
<s>  with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many </s>
<s> 

what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy </s>
<s>  said jane as she
finished it </s>
<s>  is it not clear enough </s>
<s>  does it not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister </s>
<s>  that she is
perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference </s>
<s>  and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly </s>
<s>  to
put me on my guard </s>
<s>  can there be any other opinion on the subject </s>
<s> 

yes there can </s>
<s>  for mine is totally different </s>
<s>  will you hear it </s>
<s> 

most willingly </s>
<s> 

you shall have it in a few words </s>
<s>  miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy </s>
<s>  she follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you </s>
<s> 

jane shook her head </s>
<s> 

indeed jane you ought to believe me </s>
<s>  no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection </s>
<s>  miss bingley i am sure cannot </s>
<s>  she
is not such a simpleton </s>
<s>  could she have seen half as much love in <abvr>
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes </s>
<s>  but the
case is this </s>
<s>  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them </s>
<s>  and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion
that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble
in achieving a second </s>
<s>  in which there is certainly some ingenuity and
i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way </s>
<s>  but
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead
of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend </s>
<s> 

if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your
representation of all this might make me quite easy </s>
<s>  but i know the
foundation is unjust </s>
<s>  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone </s>
<s>  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself </s>
<s> 

that is right </s>
<s>  you could not have started a more happy idea since you
will not take comfort in mine </s>
<s>  believe her to be deceived by all means </s>
<s> 
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer </s>
<s> 

but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere </s>
<s> 

you must decide for yourself said elizabeth </s>
<s>  and if upon mature
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by
all means to refuse him </s>
<s> 

how can you talk so </s>
<s>  said jane faintly smiling </s>
<s>  you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could
not hesitate </s>
<s> 

i did not think you would </s>
<s>  and that being the case i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion </s>
<s> 

but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be
required </s>
<s>  a thousand things may arise in six months </s>
<s> 

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt </s>
<s>  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone </s>
<s> 

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect </s>
<s> 
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart </s>
<s> 

they agreed that <abvr> bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct </s>
<s> 
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together </s>
<s>  after
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that <abvr>
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two
full courses </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her </s>
<s>  it keeps him in good
humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express </s>
<s> 
 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time </s>
<s>  this was
very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of </s>
<s>  its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of <abvr> collinss addresses by engaging them towards
herself </s>
<s>  such was miss lucass scheme </s>
<s>  and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very
soon </s>
<s>  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet </s>
<s>  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins
from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to
conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise </s>
<s>  for though feeling almost
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday </s>
<s> 
his reception however was of the most flattering kind </s>
<s>  miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane </s>
<s>  but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there </s>
<s> 

in as short a time as <abvr> collinss long speeches would allow
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both </s>
<s>  and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men </s>
<s>  and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness </s>
<s>  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance </s>
<s>  and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that
establishment were gained </s>
<s> 

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent </s>
<s> 
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity </s>
<s>  <abvr> collinss present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom
they could give little fortune </s>
<s>  and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair </s>
<s>  lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer
mr </s>
<s>  bennet was likely to live </s>
<s>  and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion that whenever <abvr> collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s>  the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion </s>
<s>  the younger girls formed hopes
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done </s>
<s>  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes
dying an old maid </s>
<s>  charlotte herself was tolerably composed </s>
<s>  she had
gained her point and had time to consider of it </s>
<s>  her reflections were
in general satisfactory </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins to be sure was neither sensible
nor agreeable </s>
<s>  his society was irksome and his attachment to her must
be imaginary </s>
<s>  but still he would be her husband </s>
<s>  without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object </s>
<s>  it was
the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune
and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest
preservative from want </s>
<s>  this preservative she had now obtained </s>
<s>  and at
the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all
the good luck of it </s>
<s>  the least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person </s>
<s>  elizabeth would wonder
and probably would blame her </s>
<s>  and though her resolution was not to be
shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation </s>
<s>  she resolved
to give her the information herself and therefore charged <abvr> collins
when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family </s>
<s>  a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty </s>
<s>  for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was
at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love </s>
<s> 

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet with great politeness and cordiality
said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them </s>
<s> 

my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly
gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive </s>
<s>  and
you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible </s>
<s> 

they were all astonished </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return immediately said </s>
<s> 

but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my
good sir </s>
<s>  you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness </s>
<s> 

my dear sir replied <abvr> collins i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyships concurrence </s>
<s> 

you cannot be too much upon your guard </s>
<s>  risk anything rather than her
displeasure </s>
<s>  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home
and be satisfied that we shall take no offence </s>
<s> 

believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention </s>
<s>  and depend upon it you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  as for my fair cousins though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my
cousin elizabeth </s>
<s> 

with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew </s>
<s>  all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him </s>
<s> 
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others </s>
<s>  there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very
agreeable companion </s>
<s>  but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away </s>
<s>  miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before </s>
<s> 

the possibility of <abvr> collinss fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two </s>
<s>  but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and
she could not help crying out </s>
<s> 

engaged to <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  my dear charlotteimpossible </s>
<s> 

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach </s>
<s>  though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained
her composure and calmly replied </s>
<s> 

why should you be surprised my dear eliza </s>
<s>  do you think it incredible
that <abvr> collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort
for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness </s>
<s> 

i see what you are feeling replied charlotte </s>
<s>  you must be surprised
very much surprisedso lately as <abvr> collins was wishing to marry
you </s>
<s>  but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done </s>
<s>  i am not romantic you know </s>
<s>  i never
was </s>
<s>  i ask only a comfortable home </s>
<s>  and considering <abvr> collinss
character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state </s>
<s> 

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly </s>
<s>  and after an awkward pause
they returned to the rest of the family </s>
<s>  charlotte did not stay much
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard </s>
<s> 
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match </s>
<s>  the strangeness of <abvr> collinss making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted </s>
<s>  she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible
that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage </s>
<s>  charlotte the wife of <abvr> collins was a
most humiliating picture </s>
<s>  and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what
she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family </s>
<s>  with many compliments to them
and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but
incredulous </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet with more perseverance than politeness
protested he must be entirely mistaken </s>
<s>  and lydia always unguarded and
often uncivil boisterously exclaimed </s>
<s> 

good lord </s>
<s>  sir william how can you tell such a story </s>
<s>  do not you know
that <abvr> collins wants to marry lizzy </s>
<s> 

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment </s>
<s>  but sir williams good breeding carried
him through it all </s>
<s>  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself </s>
<s>  and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she
was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character
of <abvr> collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained </s>
<s>  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent </s>
<s>  in the first place she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter </s>
<s>  secondly she was very sure that <abvr> collins
had been taken in </s>
<s>  thirdly she trusted that they would never be
happy together </s>
<s>  and fourthly that the match might be broken off </s>
<s>  two
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole </s>
<s>  one that
elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief </s>
<s>  and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all </s>
<s>  and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day </s>
<s>  nothing could
console and nothing could appease her </s>
<s>  nor did that day wear out her
resentment </s>
<s>  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort </s>
<s>  for
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and
more foolish than his daughter </s>
<s> 

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match </s>
<s>  but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness </s>
<s> 
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable </s>
<s>  kitty
and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for <abvr> collins was only a
clergyman </s>
<s>  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton </s>
<s> 

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on <abvr> bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married </s>
<s>  and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was
though <abvr> bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away </s>
<s> 

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject </s>
<s>  and elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again </s>
<s>  her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious
as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return </s>
<s> 

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again </s>
<s>  the promised
letter of thanks from <abvr> collins arrived on tuesday addressed to
their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted </s>
<s>  after discharging
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight </s>
<s>  for lady catherine
he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband </s>
<s>  it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge </s>
<s>  it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome </s>
<s>  she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable </s>
<s>  such were the gentle murmurs of <abvr> bennet and
they gave way only to the greater distress of <abvr> bingleys continued
absence </s>
<s> 

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject </s>
<s>  day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter </s>
<s>  a report which highly incensed <abvr>
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood </s>
<s> 

even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away </s>
<s>  unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its
frequently occurring </s>
<s>  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for
the strength of his attachment </s>
<s> 

as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject
was never alluded to </s>
<s>  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her
impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used </s>
<s>  it needed
all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction </s>
<s>  he was too happy however to need much attention </s>
<s> 
and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them
from a great deal of his company </s>
<s>  the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was really in a most pitiable state </s>
<s>  the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of </s>
<s>  the sight
of miss lucas was odious to her </s>
<s>  as her successor in that house she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence </s>
<s>  whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession </s>
<s>  and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to <abvr> collins was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as <abvr> bennet were dead </s>
<s>  she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband </s>
<s> 

indeed <abvr> bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to
make way for her and live to see her take her place in it </s>
<s> 

my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts </s>
<s>  let us hope for
better things </s>
<s>  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor </s>
<s> 

this was not very consoling to <abvr> bennet and therefore instead of
making any answer she went on as before </s>
<s> 

i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate </s>
<s>  if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it </s>
<s> 

what should not you mind </s>
<s> 

i should not mind anything at all </s>
<s> 

let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility </s>
<s> 

i never can be thankful <abvr> bennet for anything about the entail </s>
<s>  how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own
daughters i cannot understand </s>
<s>  and all for the sake of <abvr> collins too </s>
<s> 
why should he have it more than anybody else </s>
<s> 

i leave it to yourself to determine said <abvr> bennet </s>

chapter 


miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt </s>
<s>  the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country </s>
<s> 

hope was over entirely over </s>
<s>  and when jane could attend to the rest
of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the
writer that could give her any comfort </s>
<s>  miss darcys praise occupied
the chief of it </s>
<s>  her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter </s>
<s>  she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an
inmate of <abvr> darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture </s>
<s> 

elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this
heard it in silent indignation </s>
<s>  her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others </s>
<s>  to carolines
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit </s>
<s>  that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she
had ever done </s>
<s>  and much as she had always been disposed to like him she
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination </s>
<s>  had his own happiness however
been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as
she thought he must be sensible himself </s>
<s>  it was a subject in short
on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing </s>
<s>  she
could think of nothing else </s>
<s>  and yet whether bingleys regard had really
died away or were suppressed by his friends interference </s>
<s>  whether
he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his
observation </s>
<s>  whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained
the same her peace equally wounded </s>
<s> 

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  but at last on <abvr> bennets leaving them together after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could
not help saying </s>
<s> 

oh that my dear mother had more command over herself </s>
<s>  she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him </s>
<s>  but
i will not repine </s>
<s>  it cannot last long </s>
<s>  he will be forgot and we shall
all be as we were before </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said
nothing </s>
<s> 

you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring </s>
<s>  indeed you have
no reason </s>
<s>  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all </s>
<s>  i have nothing either to hope or fear
and nothing to reproach him with </s>
<s>  thank god </s>
<s>  i have not that pain </s>
<s>  a
little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better </s>
<s> 

with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself </s>
<s> 

my dear jane </s>
<s>  exclaimed elizabeth you are too good </s>
<s>  your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic </s>
<s>  i do not know what to say
to you </s>
<s>  i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you
deserve </s>
<s> 

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back
the praise on her sisters warm affection </s>
<s> 

nay said elizabeth this is not fair </s>
<s>  you wish to think all the
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody </s>
<s>  i only want
to think you perfect and you set yourself against it </s>
<s>  do not
be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal goodwill </s>
<s>  you need not </s>
<s>  there are few people
whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well </s>
<s>  the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it </s>
<s>  and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense </s>
<s>  i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention </s>
<s>  the
other is charlottes marriage </s>
<s>  it is unaccountable </s>
<s>  in every view it is
unaccountable </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these </s>
<s>  they will
ruin your happiness </s>
<s>  you do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper </s>
<s>  consider <abvr> collinss respectability and
charlottes steady prudent character </s>
<s>  remember that she is one of a
large family </s>
<s>  that as to fortune it is a most eligible match </s>
<s>  and be
ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin </s>
<s> 

to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this </s>
<s>  for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart </s>
<s>  my dear jane <abvr> collins is a
conceited pompous narrowminded silly man </s>
<s>  you know he is as well as
i do </s>
<s>  and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking </s>
<s>  you shall not defend her though
it is charlotte lucas </s>
<s>  you shall not for the sake of one individual
change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of
danger security for happiness </s>
<s> 

i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied
jane </s>
<s>  and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together </s>
<s>  but enough of this </s>
<s>  you alluded to something else </s>
<s>  you
mentioned two instances </s>
<s>  i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and
saying your opinion of him is sunk </s>
<s>  we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured </s>
<s>  we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect </s>
<s>  it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us </s>
<s>  women fancy admiration means more than
it does </s>
<s> 

and men take care that they should </s>
<s> 

if it is designedly done they cannot be justified </s>
<s>  but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine </s>
<s> 

i am far from attributing any part of <abvr> bingleys conduct to design
 said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but without scheming to do wrong or to make others
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery </s>
<s>  thoughtlessness
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution
will do the business </s>
<s> 

and do you impute it to either of those </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  to the last </s>
<s>  but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem </s>
<s>  stop me whilst you can </s>
<s> 

you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him </s>
<s> 

yes in conjunction with his friend </s>
<s> 

i cannot believe it </s>
<s>  why should they try to influence him </s>
<s>  they can
only wish his happiness </s>
<s>  and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it </s>
<s> 

your first position is false </s>
<s>  they may wish many things besides his
happiness </s>
<s>  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence </s>
<s>  they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great
connections and pride </s>
<s> 

beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane </s>
<s> 
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing </s>
<s>  they have
known her much longer than they have known me </s>
<s>  no wonder if they love
her better </s>
<s>  but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brothers </s>
<s>  what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very
objectionable </s>
<s>  if they believed him attached to me they would not try
to part us </s>
<s>  if he were so they could not succeed </s>
<s>  by supposing such an
affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most
unhappy </s>
<s>  do not distress me by the idea </s>
<s>  i am not ashamed of having been
mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what
i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters </s>
<s>  let me take it in
the best light in the light in which it may be understood </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish </s>
<s>  and from this time <abvr> bingleys
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity </s>
<s>  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her
no more </s>
<s>  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time she had the same story to repeat every day </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennets best
comfort was that <abvr> bingley must be down again in the summer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet treated the matter differently </s>
<s>  so lizzy said he one day
your sister is crossed in love i find </s>
<s>  i congratulate her </s>
<s>  next to
being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then </s>
<s> 
it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions </s>
<s>  when is your turn to come </s>
<s>  you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane </s>
<s>  now is your time </s>
<s>  here are officers enough in
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country </s>
<s>  let wickham
be your man </s>
<s>  he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably </s>
<s> 

thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me </s>
<s>  we must not
all expect janes good fortune </s>
<s> 

true said <abvr> bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family </s>
<s>  they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve </s>
<s>  the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard his claims on <abvr> darcy and all that he had suffered from him
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed </s>
<s>  and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked <abvr> darcy before they
had known anything of the matter </s>
<s> 

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society
of hertfordshire </s>
<s>  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else
mr </s>
<s>  darcy was condemned as the worst of men </s>

chapter 


after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity
mr </s>
<s>  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday </s>
<s>  the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride </s>
<s>  as he had reason
to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men </s>
<s>  he took leave of his
relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before </s>
<s>  wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another
letter of thanks </s>
<s> 

on the following monday <abvr> bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas
at longbourn </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly
superior to his sister as well by nature as education </s>
<s>  the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so
wellbred and agreeable </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner who was several years younger
than <abvr> bennet and <abvr> phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant
woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces </s>
<s>  between the
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard </s>
<s> 
they had frequently been staying with her in town </s>
<s> 

the first part of <abvr> gardiners business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions </s>
<s>  when this was
done she had a less active part to play </s>
<s>  it became her turn to listen </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of </s>
<s>  they
had all been very illused since she last saw her sister </s>
<s>  two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was
nothing in it </s>
<s> 

i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got <abvr>
bingley if she could </s>
<s>  but lizzy </s>
<s>  oh sister </s>
<s>  it is very hard to think
that she might have been <abvr> collinss wife by this time had it not
been for her own perverseness </s>
<s>  he made her an offer in this very room
and she refused him </s>
<s>  the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever </s>
<s>  the lucases are very artful people indeed
sister </s>
<s>  they are all for what they can get </s>
<s>  i am sorry to say it of
them but so it is </s>
<s>  it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted
so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else </s>
<s>  however your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before
in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her
sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation </s>
<s> 

when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject </s>
<s>  it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she </s>
<s>  i am
sorry it went off </s>
<s>  but these things happen so often </s>
<s>  a young man such
as you describe <abvr> bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets
her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent </s>
<s> 

an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not
do for us </s>
<s>  we do not suffer by accident </s>
<s>  it does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before </s>
<s> 

but that expression of ˜violently in love is so hackneyed so
doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea </s>
<s>  it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance
as to a real strong attachment </s>
<s>  pray how violent was <abvr> bingleys
love </s>
<s> 

i never saw a more promising inclination </s>
<s>  he was growing quite
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her </s>
<s>  every time
they met it was more decided and remarkable </s>
<s>  at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance </s>
<s>  and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer </s>
<s>  could there be
finer symptoms </s>
<s>  is not general incivility the very essence of love </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt </s>
<s>  poor
jane </s>
<s>  i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get
over it immediately </s>
<s>  it had better have happened to you lizzy </s>
<s>  you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner </s>
<s>  but do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us </s>
<s>  change of scene might be
of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded
of her sisters ready acquiescence </s>
<s> 

i hope added <abvr> gardiner that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her </s>
<s>  we live in so different a part of
town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go
out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all
unless he really comes to see her </s>
<s> 

and that is quite impossible </s>
<s>  for he is now in the custody of his
friend and <abvr> darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such
a part of london </s>
<s>  my dear aunt how could you think of it </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy may
perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he
would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities were he once to enter it </s>
<s>  and depend upon it <abvr> bingley
never stirs without him </s>
<s> 

so much the better </s>
<s>  i hope they will not meet at all </s>
<s>  but does not jane
correspond with his sister </s>
<s>  she will not be able to help calling </s>
<s> 

she will drop the acquaintance entirely </s>
<s> 

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless </s>
<s>  it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes
attractions </s>
<s> 

miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure </s>
<s>  and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of
seeing him </s>
<s> 

the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn </s>
<s>  and what with the phillipses
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its
engagement </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner </s>
<s>  when the engagement was for home some of the officers always
made part of itof which officers <abvr> wickham was sure to be one </s>
<s>  and
on these occasions <abvr> gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths
warm commendation narrowly observed them both </s>
<s>  without supposing them
from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy </s>
<s>  and
she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure
unconnected with his general powers </s>
<s>  about ten or a dozen years ago
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of derbyshire to which he belonged </s>
<s>  they had therefore many
acquaintances in common </s>
<s>  and though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late <abvr> darcy by
character perfectly well </s>
<s>  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse </s>
<s>  in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute
description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both
him and herself </s>
<s>  on being made acquainted with the present <abvr> darcys
treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard <abvr> fitzwilliam
darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone </s>
<s>  after
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on </s>
<s> 

you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it </s>
<s>  and therefore i am not afraid of speaking
openly </s>
<s>  seriously i would have you be on your guard </s>
<s>  do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent </s>
<s>  i have nothing to say against
him </s>
<s>  he is a most interesting young man </s>
<s>  and if he had the fortune he
ought to have i should think you could not do better </s>
<s>  but as it is you
must not let your fancy run away with you </s>
<s>  you have sense and we all
expect you to use it </s>
<s>  your father would depend on your resolution and
good conduct i am sure </s>
<s>  you must not disappoint your father </s>
<s> 

my dear aunt this is being serious indeed </s>
<s> 

yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise </s>
<s> 

well then you need not be under any alarm </s>
<s>  i will take care of
myself and of <abvr> wickham too </s>
<s>  he shall not be in love with me if i
can prevent it </s>
<s> 

elizabeth you are not serious now </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon i will try again </s>
<s>  at present i am not in love with
mr </s>
<s>  wickham </s>
<s>  no i certainly am not </s>
<s>  but he is beyond all comparison
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to
mei believe it will be better that he should not </s>
<s>  i see the imprudence
of it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  that abominable <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  my fathers opinion of me does
me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it </s>
<s>  my
father however is partial to <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  in short my dear aunt i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy </s>
<s>  but
since we see every day that where there is affection young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist </s>
<s>  all that i can promise you therefore is not
to be in a hurry </s>
<s>  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object </s>
<s>  when i am in company with him i will not be wishing </s>
<s>  in short
i will do my best </s>
<s> 

perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often </s>
<s>  at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him </s>
<s> 

as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile </s>
<s>  very
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that </s>
<s>  but do not imagine
that he is always here so often </s>
<s>  it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week </s>
<s>  you know my mothers ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends </s>
<s>  but really and upon my
honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest </s>
<s>  and now i hope
you are satisfied </s>
<s> 

her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints they parted </s>
<s>  a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented </s>

mr </s>
<s>  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane </s>
<s>  but as he took up his abode with the lucases
his arrival was no great inconvenience to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  his marriage was
now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that
she wished they might be happy </s>
<s>  thursday was to be the wedding day
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit </s>
<s>  and when she
rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and
reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her
out of the room </s>
<s>  as they went downstairs together charlotte said </s>
<s> 

i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza </s>
<s> 

that you certainly shall </s>
<s> 

and i have another favour to ask you </s>
<s>  will you come and see me </s>
<s> 

we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire </s>
<s> 

i am not likely to leave kent for some time </s>
<s>  promise me therefore to
come to hunsford </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit </s>
<s> 

my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i
hope you will consent to be of the party </s>
<s>  indeed eliza you will be as
welcome as either of them </s>
<s> 

the wedding took place </s>
<s>  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on
the subject as usual </s>
<s>  elizabeth soon heard from her friend </s>
<s>  and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been </s>
<s>  that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible </s>
<s>  elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was </s>
<s>  charlottes first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness </s>
<s>  there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be </s>
<s>  though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen </s>
<s>  she
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise </s>
<s>  the house furniture neighbourhood and
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most
friendly and obliging </s>
<s>  it was <abvr> collinss picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened </s>
<s>  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest </s>
<s> 

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london </s>
<s>  and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys </s>
<s> 

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is </s>
<s>  jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from caroline </s>
<s>  she accounted for it however by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost </s>
<s> 

my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the
town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street </s>
<s> 

she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley </s>
<s> 
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london </s>
<s>  i was right therefore my last letter had never reached
her </s>
<s>  i inquired after their brother of course </s>
<s>  he was well but so much
engaged with <abvr> darcy that they scarcely ever saw him </s>
<s>  i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner </s>
<s>  i wish i could see her </s>
<s>  my visit was
not long as caroline and <abvr> hurst were going out </s>
<s>  i dare say i shall
see them soon here </s>
<s> 

elizabeth shook her head over this letter </s>
<s>  it convinced her that
accident only could discover to <abvr> bingley her sisters being in town </s>
<s> 

four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him </s>
<s>  she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it </s>
<s>  but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingleys inattention </s>
<s>  after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the
visitor did at last appear </s>
<s>  but the shortness of her stay and yet more
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer </s>
<s>  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt </s>
<s> 

my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me </s>
<s>  but my dear sister
though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i
still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion </s>
<s>  i do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me </s>
<s>  but if the same circumstances were to
happen again i am sure i should be deceived again </s>
<s>  caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday </s>
<s>  and not a note not a line did i
receive in the meantime </s>
<s>  when she did come it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it </s>
<s>  she made a slight formal apology for not
calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was
in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer </s>
<s>  i pity
though i cannot help blaming her </s>
<s>  she was very wrong in singling me out
as she did </s>
<s>  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side </s>
<s>  but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it </s>
<s>  i need not explain myself farther </s>
<s>  and though we know
this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily
account for her behaviour to me </s>
<s>  and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable </s>
<s>  i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now
because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago </s>
<s> 
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said
herself </s>
<s>  and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy </s>
<s>  i
cannot understand it </s>
<s>  if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this </s>
<s>  but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought
and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  let me hear from you very
soon </s>
<s>  miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield
again of giving up the house but not with any certainty </s>
<s>  we had better
not mention it </s>
<s>  i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at hunsford </s>
<s>  pray go to see them with sir william and
maria </s>
<s>  i am sure you will be very comfortable there </s>
<s> yours etc </s>
<s> 

this letter gave elizabeth some pain </s>
<s>  but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least </s>
<s> 
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over </s>
<s>  she would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions </s>
<s>  his character sunk on
every review of it </s>
<s>  and as a punishment for him as well as a possible
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry <abvr>
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman and required information </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself </s>
<s>  his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over
he was the admirer of some one else </s>
<s>  elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain </s>
<s> 
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune
permitted it </s>
<s>  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable </s>
<s>  but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than
in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence </s>
<s> 
nothing on the contrary could be more natural </s>
<s>  and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very
sincerely wish him happy </s>
<s> 

all this was acknowledged to <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  and after relating the
circumstances she thus went on </s>
<s>  i am now convinced my dear aunt that
i have never been much in love </s>
<s>  for had i really experienced that pure
and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and
wish him all manner of evil </s>
<s>  but my feelings are not only cordial
towards him </s>
<s>  they are even impartial towards miss king </s>
<s>  i cannot find
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl </s>
<s>  there can be no love in all this </s>
<s>  my
watchfulness has been effectual </s>
<s>  and though i certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance </s>
<s> 
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly </s>
<s>  kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do </s>

ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain </s>

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold did january and february pass away </s>
<s>  march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford </s>
<s>  she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither </s>
<s>  but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty </s>
<s>  absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  there
was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake </s>
<s>  the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane </s>
<s>  and in short as the time drew near she would have
been very sorry for any delay </s>
<s>  everything however went on smoothly
and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch </s>
<s>  she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter </s>
<s>  the improvement
of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became
perfect as plan could be </s>
<s> 

the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter </s>
<s> 

the farewell between herself and <abvr> wickham was perfectly friendly </s>
<s>  on
his side even more </s>
<s>  his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired </s>
<s>  and in his manner
of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of
what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their
opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there
was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard </s>
<s>  and she parted from him convinced that
whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing </s>
<s> 

her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable </s>
<s>  sir william lucas and his daughter maria a
goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise </s>
<s>  elizabeth loved absurdities but
she had known sir williams too long </s>
<s>  he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood </s>
<s>  and his civilities were
worn out like his information </s>
<s> 

it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon </s>
<s>  as they drove to <abvr> gardiners
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival </s>
<s>  when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever </s>
<s>  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls
whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower </s>
<s>  all was joy and
kindness </s>
<s>  the day passed most pleasantly away </s>
<s>  the morning in bustle and
shopping and the evening at one of the theatres </s>
<s> 

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt </s>
<s>  their first object was her
sister </s>
<s>  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to
her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits there were periods of dejection </s>
<s>  it was reasonable however
to hope that they would not continue long </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and
complimented her on bearing it so well </s>
<s> 

but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king </s>
<s>  i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary </s>
<s> 

pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs
between the mercenary and the prudent motive </s>
<s>  where does discretion end
and avarice begin </s>
<s>  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me
because it would be imprudent </s>
<s>  and now because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is
mercenary </s>
<s> 

if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know
what to think </s>
<s> 

she is a very good kind of girl i believe </s>
<s>  i know no harm of her </s>
<s> 

but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death
made her mistress of this fortune </s>
<s> 

nowhy should he </s>
<s>  if it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally
poor </s>
<s> 

but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event </s>
<s> 

a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe </s>
<s>  if she does not object to it
why should we </s>
<s> 

her not objecting does not justify him </s>
<s>  it only shows her being
deficient in something herselfsense or feeling </s>
<s> 

well cried elizabeth have it as you choose </s>
<s>  he shall be
mercenary and she shall be foolish </s>
<s> 

no lizzy that is what i do not choose </s>
<s>  i should be sorry you know
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire </s>
<s>  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better </s>
<s>  i am sick of them all </s>

<s>  i am going tomorrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him </s>
<s>  stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing after all </s>
<s> 

take care lizzy </s>
<s>  that speech savours strongly of disappointment </s>
<s> 

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer </s>
<s> 

we have not determined how far it shall carry us said <abvr> gardiner
but perhaps to the lakes </s>

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful </s>

give me fresh life and vigour </s>

chapter 


every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment </s>
<s>  for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight </s>
<s> 

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view </s>
<s> 
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side </s>
<s>  elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants </s>
<s> 

at length the parsonage was discernible </s>
<s>  the garden sloping to the
road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge
everything declared they were arriving </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins and charlotte
appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party </s>
<s>  in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing
at the sight of each other </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received </s>
<s>  she saw
instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage </s>
<s> 
his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family </s>
<s>  they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance taken into the house </s>
<s>  and as soon as they
were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes
offers of refreshment </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory </s>
<s>  and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its
aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him </s>
<s>  but
though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion </s>
<s> 
when <abvr> collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her
eye on charlotte </s>
<s>  once or twice she could discern a faint blush </s>
<s>  but
in general charlotte wisely did not hear </s>
<s>  after sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to
the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had
happened in london <abvr> collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself </s>
<s>  to work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures </s>
<s>  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible </s>
<s>  here leading the way
through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind </s>
<s>  he could number the
fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump </s>
<s>  but of all the views which his garden or which
the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the
prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house </s>
<s>  it was a handsome
modern building well situated on rising ground </s>
<s> 

from his garden <abvr> collins would have led them round his two meadows </s>
<s> 
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost turned back </s>
<s>  and while sir william accompanied him charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased
probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands
help </s>
<s>  it was rather small but well built and convenient </s>
<s>  and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit </s>
<s>  when <abvr> collins could be
forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by
charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten </s>
<s> 

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country </s>
<s>  it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when <abvr> collins joining
in observed </s>
<s> 

yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will
be delighted with her </s>
<s>  she is all affability and condescension and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over </s>
<s>  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here </s>
<s>  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming </s>
<s>  we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed
to walk home </s>
<s>  her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us </s>
<s>  i
should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several </s>
<s> 

lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added
charlotte and a most attentive neighbour </s>
<s> 

very true my dear that is exactly what i say </s>
<s>  she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference </s>
<s> 

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news
and telling again what had already been written </s>
<s>  and when it closed
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well </s>
<s>  she had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious
interruptions of <abvr> collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings </s>
<s>  a lively imagination soon settled it all </s>
<s> 

about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion </s>
<s>  and after listening a moment she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her </s>
<s>  she opened
the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with
agitation cried out

oh my dear eliza </s>
<s>  pray make haste and come into the diningroom for
there is such a sight to be seen </s>
<s>  i will not tell you what it is </s>
<s>  make
haste and come down this moment </s>
<s> 

elizabeth asked questions in vain </s>
<s>  maria would tell her nothing more
and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in
quest of this wonder </s>
<s>  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate </s>
<s> 

and is this all </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not
lady catherine </s>
<s>  the old lady is <abvr> jenkinson who lives with them </s>
<s> 
the other is miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  only look at her </s>
<s>  she is quite a little
creature </s>
<s>  who would have thought that she could be so thin and small </s>
<s> 

she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind </s>
<s> 
why does she not come in </s>
<s> 

oh charlotte says she hardly ever does </s>
<s>  it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in </s>
<s> 

i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas </s>
<s>  she
looks sickly and cross </s>
<s>  yes she will do for him very well </s>
<s>  she will
make him a very proper wife </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies </s>
<s>  and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was
stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way </s>
<s> 

at length there was nothing more to be said </s>
<s>  the ladies drove on and
the others returned into the house </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete </s>
<s> 
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife was exactly what he had wished for </s>
<s>  and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough </s>
<s> 

i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings </s>
<s>  i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it
would happen </s>
<s>  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this </s>
<s>  who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately
after your arrival </s>
<s> 

i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire </s>
<s>  about the court such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon </s>
<s> 

scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and
so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them </s>
<s> 

when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth

do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel </s>
<s>  lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter </s>
<s>  i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion
for anything more </s>
<s>  lady catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed </s>
<s>  she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved </s>
<s> 

while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner </s>
<s>  such formidable accounts of
her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s> 

as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park </s>
<s>  every park has its beauty and its prospects </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such
raptures as <abvr> collins expected the scene to inspire and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh </s>
<s> 

when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm </s>
<s> 
elizabeths courage did not fail her </s>
<s>  she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation </s>
<s> 

from the entrancehall of which <abvr> collins pointed out with a
rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they
followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady
catherine her daughter and <abvr> jenkinson were sitting </s>
<s>  her ladyship
with great condescension arose to receive them </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary </s>
<s> 

in spite of having been at st </s>
<s>  jamess sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word </s>
<s> 
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge
of her chair not knowing which way to look </s>
<s>  elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly </s>
<s>  lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked
features which might once have been handsome </s>
<s>  her air was not
conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank </s>
<s>  she was not rendered formidable by
silence </s>
<s>  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone
as marked her selfimportance and brought <abvr> wickham immediately to
elizabeths mind </s>
<s>  and from the observation of the day altogether she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented </s>
<s> 

when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of <abvr> darcy she turned her eyes on the
daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her
being so thin and so small </s>
<s>  there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies </s>
<s>  miss de bourgh was pale and sickly </s>
<s>  her
features though not plain were insignificant </s>
<s>  and she spoke very
little except in a low voice to <abvr> jenkinson in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes </s>
<s> 

after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view <abvr> collins attending them to point out its beauties
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer </s>
<s> 

the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which <abvr> collins had promised </s>
<s>  and as he had
likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her
ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater </s>
<s>  he carved and ate and praised with delighted
alacrity </s>
<s>  and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir
william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw
said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear </s>
<s> 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them </s>
<s>  the party did not supply much conversation </s>
<s>  elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all
dinnertime </s>
<s>  <abvr> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing
she was indisposed </s>
<s>  maria thought speaking out of the question and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire </s>
<s> 

when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to
be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted </s>
<s>  she inquired into charlottes domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all </s>
<s>  told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry </s>
<s>  elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others </s>
<s>  in the intervals of her discourse
with <abvr> collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew
the least and who she observed to <abvr> collins was a very genteel
pretty kind of girl </s>
<s>  she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of
them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been
her mothers maiden name </s>
<s>  elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly </s>
<s>  lady catherine then
observed

we never had any governess </s>

no governess </s>

<s>  five daughters brought up at home
without a governess </s>
<s>  i never heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case </s>
<s> 

then who taught you </s>
<s>  who attended to you </s>
<s>  without a governess you
must have been neglected </s>
<s> 

compared with some families i believe we were </s>

read and had all the masters that were necessary </s>

aye no doubt </s>

yes my youngest is not sixteen </s>
<s>  perhaps she is full young to be
much in company </s>
<s>  but really maam i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early </s>
<s>  the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first </s>
<s>  and to be kept back on such a motive </s>
<s>  i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind </s>
<s> 

upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person </s>
<s>  pray what is your age </s>
<s> 

with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your

<s> 

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer </s>

and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence </s>

when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables
were placed </s>

down to quadrille </s>

two girls had the honour of assisting <abvr> jenkinson to make up her
party </s>
<s>  their table was superlatively stupid </s>
<s>  scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game except when <abvr> jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or

for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many </s>

sir william did not say much </s>

and noble names </s>
<s> 

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose

gratefully accepted and immediately ordered </s>
<s>  the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow </s>

the arrival of the coach </s>

collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed </s>
<s>  as soon
as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for

commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy
mr </s>

chapter 


sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with </s>
<s>  while sir william was with them <abvr> collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country </s>
<s>  but
when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom
which fronted the road </s>
<s>  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards </s>
<s> 
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the diningparlour for common use </s>
<s>  it was a better sized room and had a
more pleasant aspect </s>
<s>  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did for <abvr> collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively </s>
<s>  and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement </s>
<s> 

from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and
were indebted to <abvr> collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton
which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened
almost every day </s>
<s>  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and
had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out </s>
<s> 

very few days passed in which <abvr> collins did not walk to rosings and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise </s>
<s> 
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours </s>
<s>  now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits </s>
<s>  she examined into their employments looked at their work
and advised them to do it differently </s>
<s>  found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture </s>
<s>  or detected the housemaid in negligence </s>
<s>  and if she
accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that <abvr> collinss joints of meat were too large for her family </s>
<s> 

elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold
them into harmony and plenty </s>
<s> 

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week </s>
<s> 
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one
cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first </s>
<s>  their other engagements were few as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond <abvr> collinss reach </s>
<s>  this
however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough </s>
<s>  there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors </s>
<s>  her favourite walk and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity </s>
<s> 

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away </s>
<s> 
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be
important </s>
<s>  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that <abvr> darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently
destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself </s>
<s> 

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage </s>
<s>  for <abvr> collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great
intelligence </s>
<s>  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects </s>
<s>  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for
mr </s>
<s>  darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of
his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when
mr </s>
<s>  collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him </s>
<s>  charlotte had seen
them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding </s>
<s> 

i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and
address most truly the gentleman </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual
reserve to <abvr> collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend met her with every appearance of composure </s>
<s>  elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word </s>
<s> 

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly </s>
<s>  but
his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to <abvr> collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody </s>
<s> 
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family </s>
<s>  she answered him in the usual
way and after a moments pause added </s>
<s> 

my eldest sister has been in town these three months </s>
<s>  have you never
happened to see her there </s>
<s> 

she was perfectly sensible that he never had </s>
<s>  but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet </s>
<s>  the
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away </s>
<s> 



chapter 


colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at rosings </s>
<s>  it was some days however before they
received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary </s>
<s>  and it was not till easterday
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening </s>
<s>  for the last week they had seen very little
of lady catherine or her daughter </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the
parsonage more than once during the time but <abvr> darcy they had seen
only at church </s>
<s> 

the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherines drawingroom </s>
<s>  her ladyship received
them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else </s>
<s>  and she was in fact
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy
much more than to any other person in the room </s>
<s> 

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them </s>
<s>  anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collinss pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much </s>
<s>  he now seated himself by her and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying
at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before </s>
<s>  and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself
as well as of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity </s>
<s>  and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not
scruple to call out </s>
<s> 

what is that you are saying fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  what is it you are talking
of </s>
<s>  what are you telling miss bennet </s>
<s>  let me hear what it is </s>
<s> 

we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid
a reply </s>
<s> 

of music </s>
<s>  then pray speak aloud </s>
<s>  it is of all subjects my delight </s>
<s>  i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music </s>
<s> 
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself or a better natural taste </s>
<s>  if i had ever learnt
i should have been a great proficient </s>
<s>  and so would anne if her health
had allowed her to apply </s>
<s>  i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully </s>
<s>  how does georgiana get on darcy </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency </s>
<s> 

i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady
catherine </s>
<s>  and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal </s>
<s> 

i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice </s>
<s> 
she practises very constantly </s>
<s> 

so much the better </s>
<s>  it cannot be done too much </s>
<s>  and when i next write
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account </s>
<s>  i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice </s>
<s>  i have told miss bennet several times that she
will never play really well unless she practises more </s>
<s>  and though <abvr>
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told
her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in <abvr>
jenkinsons room </s>
<s>  she would be in nobodys way you know in that part
of the house </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made
no answer </s>
<s> 

when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him </s>
<s>  and she sat down directly to the instrument </s>
<s>  he
drew a chair near her </s>
<s>  lady catherine listened to half a song and then
talked as before to her other nephew </s>
<s>  till the latter walked away
from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers
countenance </s>
<s>  elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said </s>
<s> 

you mean to frighten me <abvr> darcy by coming in all this state to hear
me </s>
<s>  i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well </s>
<s>  there
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others </s>
<s>  my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me </s>
<s> 

i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you </s>
<s>  and i have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own </s>
<s> 

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me and teach you not to believe a word i say </s>
<s>  i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part
of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit </s>
<s>  indeed <abvr> darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to
say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear </s>
<s> 

i am not afraid of you said he smilingly </s>
<s> 

pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel
fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  i should like to know how he behaves among strangers </s>
<s> 

you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful </s>
<s> 
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know
was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did </s>
<s>  he danced
only four dances though gentlemen were scarce </s>
<s>  and to my certain
knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy you cannot deny the fact </s>
<s> 

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s>  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom </s>
<s>  well colonel
fitzwilliam what do i play next </s>
<s>  my fingers wait your orders </s>
<s> 

perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction </s>
<s>  but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers </s>
<s> 

shall we ask your cousin the reason of this </s>
<s>  said elizabeth still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers </s>
<s> 

i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to
him </s>
<s>  it is because he will not give himself the trouble </s>
<s> 

i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before </s>
<s>  i cannot
catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their
concerns as i often see done </s>
<s> 

my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many womens do </s>
<s>  they have not the same
force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression </s>
<s>  but then i
have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the
trouble of practising </s>
<s>  it is not that i do not believe my fingers as
capable as any other womans of superior execution </s>
<s> 

darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right </s>
<s>  you have employed your
time much better </s>
<s>  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting </s>
<s>  we neither of us perform to strangers </s>
<s> 

here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know
what they were talking of </s>
<s>  elizabeth immediately began playing again </s>
<s> 
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said
to darcy </s>
<s> 

miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and
could have the advantage of a london master </s>
<s>  she has a very good notion
of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes </s>
<s>  anne would have
been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousins praise </s>
<s>  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love </s>
<s>  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation </s>
<s> 

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste </s>
<s>  elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was
ready to take them all home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane
while <abvr> collins and maria were gone on business into the village
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a
visitor </s>
<s>  as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to
be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her
halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions
when the door opened and to her very great surprise <abvr> darcy and
mr </s>
<s>  darcy only entered the room </s>
<s> 

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within </s>
<s> 

they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence </s>
<s>  it was absolutely
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure she observed </s>
<s> 

how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to <abvr> bingley to see you
all after him so soon </s>
<s>  for if i recollect right he went but the day
before </s>
<s>  he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london </s>
<s> 

perfectly so i thank you </s>
<s> 

she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short
pause added </s>
<s> 

i think i have understood that <abvr> bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again </s>
<s> 

i have never heard him say so </s>
<s>  but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future </s>
<s>  he has many friends and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing </s>
<s> 

if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we
might possibly get a settled family there </s>
<s>  but perhaps <abvr> bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle </s>
<s> 

i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no answer </s>
<s>  she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend </s>
<s>  and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him </s>
<s> 

he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable
house </s>
<s>  lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when <abvr>
collins first came to hunsford </s>
<s> 

i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife </s>
<s> 

yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made
him happy if they had </s>
<s>  my friend has an excellent understandingthough
i am not certain that i consider her marrying <abvr> collins as the
wisest thing she ever did </s>
<s>  she seems perfectly happy however and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her </s>
<s> 

it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends </s>
<s> 

an easy distance do you call it </s>
<s>  it is nearly fifty miles </s>
<s> 

and what is fifty miles of good road </s>
<s>  little more than half a days
journey </s>
<s>  yes i call it a very easy distance </s>
<s> 

i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
of the match cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i should never have said <abvr> collins
was settled near her family </s>
<s> 

it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire </s>
<s>  anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far </s>
<s> 

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood </s>
<s>  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield and she blushed as she answered </s>
<s> 

i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family </s>
<s>  the far and the near must be relative and depend on many
varying circumstances </s>
<s>  where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil </s>
<s>  but that is not the
case here </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> collins have a comfortable income but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half
the present distance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment </s>
<s>  you cannot have
been always at longbourn </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked surprised </s>
<s>  the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling </s>
<s>  he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and
glancing over it said in a colder voice </s>
<s> 

are you pleased with kent </s>
<s> 

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side
calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister just returned from her walk </s>
<s>  the teteatete surprised
them </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody went away </s>
<s> 

what can be the meaning of this </s>
<s>  said charlotte as soon as he was
gone </s>
<s>  my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never
have called us in this familiar way </s>
<s> 

but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely
even to charlottes wishes to be the case </s>
<s>  and after various
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable
from the time of year </s>
<s>  all field sports were over </s>
<s>  within doors there
was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors </s>
<s>  and in the nearness of the parsonage or the
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day </s>
<s>  they called at various times of the morning sometimes
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their
aunt </s>
<s>  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more </s>
<s>  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her
former favourite george wickham </s>
<s>  and though in comparing them she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners
she believed he might have the best informed mind </s>
<s> 

but why <abvr> darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand </s>
<s>  it could not be for society as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips </s>
<s>  and when he did speak
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice
to propriety not a pleasure to himself </s>
<s>  he seldom appeared really
animated </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins knew not what to make of him </s>
<s>  colonel
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her </s>
<s>  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself
seriously to work to find it out </s>
<s>  she watched him whenever they were at
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford </s>
<s>  but without much success </s>
<s>  he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that
look was disputable </s>
<s>  it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind </s>
<s> 

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment </s>
<s>  for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would
vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power </s>
<s> 


in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man </s>
<s>  he
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible </s>
<s>  but
to counterbalance these advantages <abvr> darcy had considerable patronage
in the church and his cousin could have none at all </s>
<s> 



chapter 


more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park
unexpectedly meet <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to
prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers </s>
<s>  how it could occur a second time
therefore was very odd </s>
<s>  yet it did and even a third </s>
<s>  it seemed like
wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her </s>
<s>  he
never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much </s>
<s>  but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout
her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her
opinion of <abvr> and <abvr> collinss happiness </s>
<s>  and that in speaking of
rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
there too </s>
<s>  his words seemed to imply it </s>
<s>  could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts </s>
<s>  she supposed if he meant anything he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter </s>
<s>  it distressed
her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the parsonage </s>
<s> 

she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter
and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in
spirits when instead of being again surprised by <abvr> darcy she saw
on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her </s>
<s>  putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile she said </s>
<s> 

i did not know before that you ever walked this way </s>
<s> 

i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally
do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage </s>
<s>  are
you going much farther </s>
<s> 

no i should have turned in a moment </s>
<s> 

and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage
together </s>
<s> 

do you certainly leave kent on saturday </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

yesif darcy does not put it off again </s>
<s>  but i am at his disposal </s>
<s>  he
arranges the business just as he pleases </s>
<s> 

and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice </s>
<s>  i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s> 
but so we all do </s>
<s>  it is only that he has better means of having it
than many others because he is rich and many others are poor </s>
<s>  i speak
feelingly </s>
<s>  a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and
dependence </s>
<s> 

in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either </s>
<s>  now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and
dependence </s>
<s>  when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for </s>
<s> 

these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature </s>
<s>  but in matters of greater
weight i may suffer from want of money </s>
<s>  younger sons cannot marry where
they like </s>
<s> 

unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often
do </s>
<s> 

our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money </s>
<s> 

is this thought elizabeth meant for me </s>
<s>  and she coloured at the
idea </s>
<s>  but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what
is the usual price of an earls younger son </s>
<s>  unless the elder brother is
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped </s>
<s>  to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed
she soon afterwards said </s>
<s> 

i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal </s>
<s>  i wonder he does not marry to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind </s>
<s>  but perhaps his sister does as well
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he
likes with her </s>
<s> 

no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must
divide with me </s>
<s>  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy </s>
<s> 

are you indeed </s>
<s>  and pray what sort of guardians do you make </s>
<s>  does your
charge give you much trouble </s>
<s>  young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she
may like to have her own way </s>
<s> 

as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly </s>
<s>  and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth </s>
<s>  she directly replied </s>
<s> 

you need not be frightened </s>
<s>  i never heard any harm of her </s>
<s>  and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world </s>
<s>  she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance <abvr> hurst and
miss bingley </s>
<s>  i think i have heard you say that you know them </s>
<s> 

i know them a little </s>
<s>  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe
is a great friend of darcys </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes said elizabeth drily </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is uncommonly kind to <abvr>
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him </s>
<s> 

care of him </s>
<s>  yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care </s>
<s>  from something that he told me in
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him </s>
<s>  but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant </s>
<s>  it was all conjecture </s>
<s> 

what is it you mean </s>
<s> 

it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known
because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an
unpleasant thing </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon my not mentioning it </s>
<s> 

and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley </s>
<s>  what he told me was merely this </s>
<s>  that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer </s>
<s> 

did <abvr> darcy give you reasons for this interference </s>
<s> 

i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady </s>
<s> 

and what arts did he use to separate them </s>
<s> 

he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling </s>
<s>  he
only told me what i have now told you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with
indignation </s>
<s>  after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful </s>
<s> 

i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she </s>
<s>  your
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings </s>
<s>  why was he to be the judge </s>
<s> 

you are rather disposed to call his interference officious </s>
<s> 

i do not see what right <abvr> darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy </s>
<s> 
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the
particulars it is not fair to condemn him </s>
<s>  it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case </s>
<s> 

that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly </s>
<s> 

this was spoken jestingly </s>
<s>  but it appeared to her so just a picture
of <abvr> darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the parsonage </s>
<s>  there shut into her own room
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard </s>
<s>  it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected </s>
<s>  there
could not exist in the world two men over whom <abvr> darcy could have
such boundless influence </s>
<s>  that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted </s>
<s>  but she had
always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them </s>
<s>  if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was
the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had
suffered and still continued to suffer </s>
<s>  he had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the
world </s>
<s>  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted </s>
<s> 

there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel
fitzwilliams words </s>
<s>  and those strong objections probably were her
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in
business in london </s>
<s> 

to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of
objection </s>
<s>  all loveliness and goodness as she is </s>
<s> her understanding
excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating </s>
<s>  neither
could anything be urged against my father who though with some
peculiarities has abilities <abvr> darcy himself need not disdain and
respectability which he will probably never reach </s>
<s>  when she thought of
her mother her confidence gave way a little </s>
<s>  but she would not allow
that any objections there had material weight with <abvr> darcy whose
pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense </s>
<s> 
and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining <abvr>
bingley for his sister </s>
<s> 

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache </s>
<s>  and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to
her unwillingness to see <abvr> darcy it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her </s>
<s>  but <abvr> collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather
displeased by her staying at home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against <abvr> darcy chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent </s>
<s>  they contained no actual complaint nor was there any
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering </s>
<s> 
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded </s>
<s>  elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcys
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her
a keener sense of her sisters sufferings </s>
<s>  it was some consolation
to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the
nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits by all that affection could do </s>
<s> 

she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him </s>
<s>  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not
mean to be unhappy about him </s>
<s> 

while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in
the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her </s>
<s> 
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently
affected when to her utter amazement she saw <abvr> darcy walk into the
room </s>
<s>  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better </s>
<s> 
she answered him with cold civility </s>
<s>  he sat down for a few moments and
then getting up walked about the room </s>
<s>  elizabeth was surprised but
said not a word </s>
<s>  after a silence of several minutes he came towards her
in an agitated manner and thus began </s>
<s> 

in vain i have struggled </s>
<s>  it will not do </s>
<s>  my feelings will not be
repressed </s>
<s>  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you </s>
<s> 

elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression </s>
<s>  she stared coloured
doubted and was silent </s>
<s>  this he considered sufficient encouragement </s>
<s> 
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her
immediately followed </s>
<s>  he spoke well </s>
<s>  but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed </s>
<s>  and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride </s>
<s>  his sense of her inferiorityof
its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit </s>
<s> 

in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive </s>
<s>  till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she
lost all compassion in anger </s>
<s>  she tried however to compose herself to
answer him with patience when he should have done </s>
<s>  he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite
of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer </s>
<s>  and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand </s>
<s>  as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer </s>
<s>  he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but
his countenance expressed real security </s>
<s>  such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her
cheeks and she said </s>
<s> 

in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however
unequally they may be returned </s>
<s>  it is natural that obligation should
be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you </s>
<s>  but i
cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly </s>
<s>  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone </s>
<s>  it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be
of short duration </s>
<s>  the feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise </s>
<s>  his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature </s>
<s>  he was struggling for the
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it </s>
<s>  the pause was to elizabeths feelings
dreadful </s>
<s>  at length with a voice of forced calmness he said </s>
<s> 

and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting </s>
<s> 
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at
civility i am thus rejected </s>
<s>  but it is of small importance </s>
<s> 

i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will against your reason and even against your character </s>
<s> 
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil </s>
<s>  but i have
other provocations </s>
<s>  you know i have </s>
<s>  had not my feelings decided against
youhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most
beloved sister </s>
<s> 

as she pronounced these words <abvr> darcy changed colour </s>
<s>  but the emotion
was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued </s>
<s> 

i have every reason in the world to think ill of you </s>
<s>  no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there </s>
<s>  you dare not
you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means
of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind </s>
<s> 

she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse </s>
<s> 
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity </s>
<s> 

can you deny that you have done it </s>
<s>  she repeated </s>
<s> 

with assumed tranquillity he then replied </s>
<s>  i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister or that i rejoice in my success </s>
<s>  towards him i have been
kinder than towards myself </s>
<s> 

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her </s>
<s> 

but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike
is founded </s>
<s>  long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided </s>
<s>  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  on this subject what can you have to
say </s>
<s>  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself </s>
<s> 
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others </s>
<s> 

you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy
in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour </s>
<s> 

who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him </s>
<s> 

his misfortunes </s>
<s>  repeated darcy contemptuously </s>
<s>  yes his misfortunes
have been great indeed </s>
<s> 

and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy </s>
<s>  you have reduced
him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty </s>
<s>  you have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him </s>
<s>  you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert </s>
<s>  you have done all this </s>
<s> 
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule </s>
<s> 

and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room
is your opinion of me </s>
<s>  this is the estimation in which you hold me </s>
<s> 
i thank you for explaining it so fully </s>
<s>  my faults according to this
calculation are heavy indeed </s>
<s>  but perhaps added he stopping in
his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design </s>
<s>  these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater
policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination </s>
<s>  by reason by
reflection by everything </s>
<s>  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence </s>
<s> 
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related </s>
<s>  they were natural and
just </s>
<s>  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections </s>
<s> to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment </s>
<s>  yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken <abvr> darcy if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern
which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner </s>
<s> 

she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued </s>
<s> 

you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it </s>
<s> 

again his astonishment was obvious </s>
<s>  and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification </s>
<s>  she went on </s>
<s> 

from the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayof
my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike </s>
<s>  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry </s>
<s> 

you have said quite enough madam </s>
<s>  i perfectly comprehend your
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been </s>
<s> 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness </s>
<s> 

and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house </s>
<s> 

the tumult of her mind was now painfully great </s>
<s>  she knew not how
to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
halfanhour </s>
<s>  her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed
was increased by every review of it </s>
<s>  that she should receive an offer of
marriage from <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  that he should have been in love with her for
so many months </s>
<s>  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying
her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own casewas almost incredible </s>
<s>  it was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection </s>
<s>  but his pride his abominable
pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could
not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned <abvr>
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited </s>
<s>  she continued in very agitated reflections till the

chapter 


elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes </s>
<s>  she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened </s>
<s>  it was impossible to think of anything
else </s>
<s>  and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise </s>
<s>  she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of <abvr> darcys
sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park
she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad </s>
<s>  the
park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground </s>
<s> 

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and
look into the park </s>
<s>  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees </s>
<s>  she was on the point of continuing her walk
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park </s>
<s>  he was moving that way </s>
<s>  and fearful of its being <abvr>
darcy she was directly retreating </s>
<s>  but the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced
her name </s>
<s>  she had turned away </s>
<s>  but on hearing herself called though
in a voice which proved it to be <abvr> darcy she moved again towards the
gate </s>
<s>  he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure
i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you </s>
<s> 
will you do me the honour of reading that letter </s>
<s>  and then with a
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight </s>
<s> 

with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity
elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written
quite through in a very close hand </s>
<s>  the envelope itself was likewise
full </s>
<s>  pursuing her way along the lane she then began it </s>
<s>  it was dated
from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows </s>
<s> 

be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you </s>
<s>  i write without any
intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes
which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten </s>
<s>  and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion
should have been spared had not my character required it to be written
and read </s>
<s>  you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention </s>
<s>  your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i
demand it of your justice </s>
<s> 

two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal
magnitude you last night laid to my charge </s>
<s>  the first mentioned was
that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <abvr> bingley
from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various
claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged
favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could
bear no comparison </s>
<s>  but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope
to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read </s>
<s>  if in the explanation of them which
is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry </s>
<s>  the necessity
must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd </s>
<s> 

i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with
others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country </s>
<s>  but it was not till the evening of the dance
at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment </s>
<s>  i had often seen him in love before </s>
<s>  at that ball while i
had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir
william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage </s>
<s> 
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could
be undecided </s>
<s>  from that moment i observed my friends behaviour
attentively </s>
<s>  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss
bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him </s>
<s>  your sister i also
watched </s>
<s>  her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever
but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced
from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions
with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment </s>
<s>  if you have not been mistaken here i must have been
in error </s>
<s>  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable </s>
<s>  if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable </s>
<s>  but i shall not
scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be
easily touched </s>
<s>  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears </s>
<s>  i did not believe
her to be indifferent because i wished it </s>
<s>  i believed it on impartial
conviction as truly as i wished it in reason </s>
<s>  my objections to the
marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case </s>
<s>  the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me </s>
<s>  but
there were other causes of repugnance </s>
<s>  causes which though still
existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had
myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before
me </s>
<s>  these causes must be stated though briefly </s>
<s>  the situation of your
mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your
father </s>
<s>  pardon me </s>
<s>  it pains me to offend you </s>
<s>  but amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this
representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both </s>
<s>  i will only say
farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties
was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
connection </s>
<s>  he left netherfield for london on the day following as
you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning </s>
<s> 

the part which i acted is now to be explained </s>
<s>  his sisters uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own </s>
<s>  our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
london </s>
<s>  we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice </s>
<s>  i
described and enforced them earnestly </s>
<s>  but however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been
seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your
sisters indifference </s>
<s>  he had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere if not with equal regard </s>
<s>  but bingley has great
natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own </s>
<s>  to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was
no very difficult point </s>
<s>  to persuade him against returning into
hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the
work of a moment </s>
<s>  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much </s>
<s>  there
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not
reflect with satisfaction </s>
<s>  it is that i condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in
town </s>
<s>  i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley </s>
<s>  but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it </s>
<s>  that they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable </s>
<s>  but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger </s>
<s>  perhaps this
concealment this disguise was beneath me </s>
<s>  it is done however and it
was done for the best </s>
<s>  on this subject i have nothing more to say no
other apology to offer </s>
<s>  if i have wounded your sisters feelings it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn
them </s>
<s> 

with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured
mr </s>
<s>  wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family </s>
<s>  of what he has particularly accused me i
am ignorant </s>
<s>  but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many
years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him </s>
<s>  and on george wickham who was his godson his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed </s>
<s>  my father supported him at
school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his
own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have
been unable to give him a gentlemans education </s>
<s>  my father was not only
fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging </s>
<s>  he
had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be
his profession intended to provide for him in it </s>
<s>  as for myself it is
many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different
manner </s>
<s>  the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <abvr>
darcy could not have </s>
<s>  here again i shall give you painto what degree
you only can tell </s>
<s>  but whatever may be the sentiments which <abvr> wickham
has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive </s>
<s> 

my excellent father died about five years ago </s>
<s>  and his attachment to
mr </s>
<s>  wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant </s>
<s>  there
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds </s>
<s>  his own father did not long
survive mine and within half a year from these events <abvr> wickham
wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders
he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he
could not be benefited </s>
<s>  he had some intention he added of studying
law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein </s>
<s>  i rather wished than believed
him to be sincere </s>
<s>  but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal </s>
<s>  i knew that <abvr> wickham ought not to be a clergyman </s>
<s>  the
business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance
in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  all connection
between us seemed now dissolved </s>
<s>  i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley or admit his society in town </s>
<s>  in town i believe he chiefly
lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free
from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation </s>
<s> 
for about three years i heard little of him </s>
<s>  but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation </s>
<s>  his circumstances he assured
me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad </s>
<s>  he
had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in
questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was
well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not
have forgotten my revered fathers intentions </s>
<s>  you will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every
repetition to it </s>
<s>  his resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself </s>
<s>  after this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped </s>
<s>  how he lived i know not </s>
<s>  but
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice </s>
<s> 

i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being </s>
<s>  having said thus much i feel no doubt of your
secrecy </s>
<s>  my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to
the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself </s>
<s> 
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed
for her in london </s>
<s>  and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it to ramsgate </s>
<s>  and thither also went <abvr> wickham undoubtedly by
design </s>
<s>  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and <abvr> younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived </s>
<s>  and
by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and
to consent to an elopement </s>
<s>  she was then but fifteen which must be her
excuse </s>
<s>  and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed
the knowledge of it to herself </s>
<s>  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father acknowledged the whole to me </s>
<s>  you may imagine what i felt and
how i acted </s>
<s>  regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure </s>
<s>  but i wrote to <abvr> wickham who left the place
immediately and <abvr> younge was of course removed from her charge </s>
<s>  <abvr>
wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which
is thirty thousand pounds </s>
<s>  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement </s>
<s>  his revenge would have
been complete indeed </s>
<s> 

this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together </s>
<s>  and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <abvr>
wickham </s>
<s>  i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you </s>
<s>  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at </s>
<s>  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either
detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination </s>
<s> 

you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night </s>
<s>  but
i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed </s>
<s>  for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of
the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions </s>
<s>  if your abhorrence of me
should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin </s>
<s>  and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning </s>
<s>  i will only add god bless you </s>

fitzwilliam darcy



chapter 


if elizabeth when <abvr> darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents </s>
<s>  but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited </s>
<s> 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined </s>
<s>  with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power </s>
<s> 
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation
to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal </s>
<s>  with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what
had happened at netherfield </s>
<s>  she read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes </s>
<s>  his belief of her sisters insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false </s>
<s>  and his account of the real the worst
objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice </s>
<s>  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her </s>
<s>  his style was not penitent but haughty </s>
<s>  it was all pride and
insolence </s>
<s> 

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <abvr> wickhamwhen
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition </s>
<s> 
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her </s>
<s>  she wished
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false </s>
<s> 
this cannot be </s>
<s>  this must be the grossest falsehood </s>
<s> and when she had
gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not
regard it that she would never look in it again </s>
<s> 

in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on
nothing she walked on </s>
<s>  but it would not do </s>
<s>  in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence </s>
<s> 
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself </s>
<s>  and the kindness of the late <abvr> darcy though
she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own
words </s>
<s>  so far each recital confirmed the other </s>
<s>  but when she came to the
will the difference was great </s>
<s>  what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other </s>
<s>  and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err </s>
<s>  but when she read and reread with the closest attention the
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate </s>
<s>  she put down
the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with
little success </s>
<s>  on both sides it was only assertion </s>
<s>  again she read
on </s>
<s>  but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render <abvr> darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole </s>
<s> 

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
mr </s>
<s>  wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her </s>
<s>  the more so as she could
bring no proof of its injustice </s>
<s>  she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town
had there renewed a slight acquaintance </s>
<s>  of his former way of life
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself </s>
<s>  as
to his real character had information been in her power she had
never felt a wish of inquiring </s>
<s>  his countenance voice and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue </s>
<s>  she tried
to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of
mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what <abvr> darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance </s>
<s>  but
no such recollection befriended her </s>
<s>  she could see him instantly before
her in every charm of air and address </s>
<s>  but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess </s>
<s>  after
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to
read </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  the story which followed of his designs on miss
darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before </s>
<s>  and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no
reason to question </s>
<s>  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that <abvr> darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his
cousins corroboration </s>
<s> 

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at <abvr> phillipss </s>
<s> 
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory </s>
<s>  she was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and
wondered it had escaped her before </s>
<s>  she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct </s>
<s>  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing <abvr> darcythat <abvr> darcy might leave the country but that
he should stand his ground </s>
<s>  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week </s>
<s>  she remembered also that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but
herself </s>
<s>  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed </s>
<s> 
that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking <abvr> darcys
character though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son </s>
<s> 

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned </s>
<s> 
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary </s>
<s>  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything </s>
<s> 
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive </s>
<s>  he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown </s>
<s>  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter </s>
<s>  and in farther justification of <abvr> darcy she could not
but allow that <abvr> bingley when questioned by jane had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair </s>
<s>  that proud and repulsive as
were his manners she had never in the whole course of their
acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits </s>
<s>  that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling </s>
<s>  that had his
actions been what <abvr> wickham represented them so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world </s>
<s>  and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as <abvr> bingley was incomprehensible </s>
<s> 

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself </s>
<s>  of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced
absurd </s>
<s> 

how despicably i have acted </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  i who have prided myself
on my discernment </s>
<s>  i who have valued myself on my abilities </s>
<s>  who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust </s>
<s>  how humiliating is this
discovery </s>
<s>  yet how just a humiliation </s>
<s>  had i been in love i could
not have been more wretchedly blind </s>
<s>  but vanity not love has been my
folly </s>
<s>  pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were
concerned </s>
<s>  till this moment i never knew myself </s>
<s> 

from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that <abvr> darcys explanation
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again </s>
<s>  widely
different was the effect of a second perusal </s>
<s>  how could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to
give in the other </s>
<s>  he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sisters attachment </s>
<s>  and she could not help remembering what charlottes
opinion had always been </s>
<s>  neither could she deny the justice of his
description of jane </s>
<s>  she felt that janes feelings though fervent were
little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility </s>
<s> 

when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense
of shame was severe </s>
<s>  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers </s>
<s> 

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt </s>
<s>  it soothed
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
selfattracted by the rest of her family </s>
<s>  and as she considered
that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before </s>
<s> 

after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every
variety of thoughtreconsidering events determining probabilities
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made
her at length return home </s>
<s>  and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation </s>
<s> 

she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy only for a few minutes to take
leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found </s>
<s>  elizabeth could but just affect concern
in missing him </s>
<s>  she really rejoiced at it </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object </s>
<s>  she could think only of her letter </s>

chapter 


the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and <abvr> collins having
been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings </s>
<s>  to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter </s>
<s>  and on his return
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her </s>

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece </s>

ladyships indignation would have been </s>
<s>  what would she have said </s>

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party </s>

but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins will be very glad of your
company i am sure </s>
<s> 

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied
elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it </s>
<s>  i must be in town
next saturday </s>
<s> 

why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks </s>
<s>  i expected
you to stay two months </s>
<s>  i told <abvr> collins so before you came </s>
<s>  there
can be no occasion for your going so soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight </s>
<s> 

but my father cannot </s>
<s>  he wrote last week to hurry my return </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  your father of course may spare you if your mother can </s>
<s>  daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father </s>
<s>  and if you will stay
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london for i am going there early in june for a week </s>
<s>  and as
dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room
for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large </s>
<s> 

you are all kindness madam </s>
<s>  but i believe we must abide by our
original plan </s>
<s> 

lady catherine seemed resigned </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins you must send a servant
with them </s>
<s>  you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves </s>
<s>  it is highly improper </s>
<s> 
you must contrive to send somebody </s>
<s>  i have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing </s>
<s>  young women should always be properly
guarded and attended according to their situation in life </s>
<s>  when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her
having two menservants go with her </s>
<s>  miss darcy the daughter of
mr </s>
<s>  darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner </s>
<s>  i am excessively attentive to all those
things </s>
<s>  you must send john with the young ladies <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  i
am glad it occurred to me to mention it </s>
<s>  for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone </s>
<s> 

my uncle is to send a servant for us </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  your uncle </s>
<s>  he keeps a manservant does he </s>
<s>  i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things </s>
<s>  where shall you change horses </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  bromley of course </s>
<s>  if you mention my name at the bell you will be
attended to </s>
<s> 

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her </s>
<s>  or with a mind so
occupied she might have forgotten where she was </s>
<s>  reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours </s>
<s>  whenever she was alone she gave way to it
as the greatest relief </s>
<s>  and not a day went by without a solitary
walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart </s>
<s>  she
studied every sentence </s>
<s>  and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different </s>
<s>  when she remembered the style of his address
she was still full of indignation </s>
<s>  but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against
herself </s>
<s>  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion </s>
<s> 
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect </s>
<s>  but she
could not approve him </s>
<s>  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again </s>
<s>  in her own past
behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret </s>
<s>  and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin </s>
<s> 
they were hopeless of remedy </s>
<s>  her father contented with laughing at
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters </s>
<s>  and her mother with manners so far from right
herself was entirely insensible of the evil </s>
<s>  elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia </s>
<s>  but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence
what chance could there be of improvement </s>
<s>  catherine weakspirited
irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always
affronted by their advice </s>
<s>  and lydia selfwilled and careless would
scarcely give them a hearing </s>
<s>  they were ignorant idle and vain </s>
<s>  while
there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him </s>
<s>  and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there
forever </s>
<s> 

anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern </s>
<s>  and <abvr> darcys
explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion
heightened the sense of what jane had lost </s>
<s>  his affection was proved
to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend </s>
<s>  how
grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every
respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had
been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family </s>
<s> 

when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful </s>
<s> 

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first </s>
<s>  the very last evening was spent
there </s>
<s>  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh </s>
<s> 

when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them
a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year </s>
<s> 
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both </s>
<s> 



chapter 


on saturday morning elizabeth and <abvr> collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared </s>
<s>  and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary </s>
<s> 

i know not miss elizabeth said he whether <abvr> collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us </s>
<s>  but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it </s>
<s>  the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you </s>
<s>  we
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode </s>
<s>  our plain
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we
see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself </s>
<s>  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness </s>
<s>  she
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment </s>
<s>  and the pleasure of being with
charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her
feel the obliged </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was gratified and with a more smiling
solemnity replied </s>
<s> 

it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably </s>
<s>  we have certainly done our best </s>
<s>  and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and
from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome </s>
<s>  our situation with regard to
lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast </s>
<s>  you see on what a footing we are </s>
<s>  you
see how continually we are engaged there </s>
<s>  in truth i must acknowledge
that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are
sharers of our intimacy at rosings </s>
<s> 

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings </s>
<s>  and he was
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences </s>
<s> 

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire my dear cousin </s>
<s>  i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so </s>
<s>  lady catherines great attentions to <abvr> collins you
have been a daily witness of </s>
<s>  and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be
as well to be silent </s>
<s>  only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage </s>
<s>  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking </s>
<s>  there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us </s>
<s>  we seem to have been designed for each
other </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts </s>
<s>  she was not sorry however to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang </s>
<s> 
poor charlotte </s>
<s>  it was melancholy to leave her to such society </s>
<s>  but she
had chosen it with her eyes open </s>
<s>  and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion </s>
<s>  her
home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their
dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms </s>
<s> 

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready </s>
<s>  after an affectionate
parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr </s>
<s>  collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his
compliments to <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner though unknown </s>
<s>  he then handed her
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed
when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings </s>
<s> 

but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no objection </s>
<s>  the door was then allowed to be shut and
the carriage drove off </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems
but a day or two since we first came </s>
<s>  and yet how many things have
happened </s>
<s> 

a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh </s>
<s> 

we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice </s>
<s> 
how much i shall have to tell </s>
<s> 

elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to conceal </s>
<s> 

their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm </s>
<s>  and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached <abvr> gardiners
house where they were to remain a few days </s>
<s> 

jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them </s>
<s>  but jane was to go home with her and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation </s>
<s> 

it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn before she told her sister of <abvr> darcys proposals </s>
<s>  to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate </s>
<s> 
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried
into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister
further </s>
<s> 



chapter 


it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of  in hertfordshire </s>
<s> 
and as they drew near the appointed inn where <abvr> bennets carriage
was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs </s>
<s> 
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and
dressing a salad and cucumber </s>
<s> 

after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming
is not this nice </s>
<s>  is not this an agreeable surprise </s>
<s> 

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there </s>
<s>  then showing
her purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet </s>
<s>  i do not think
it is very pretty </s>
<s>  but i thought i might as well buy it as not </s>
<s>  i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any
better </s>
<s> 

and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect
unconcern oh </s>
<s>  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop </s>
<s>  and
when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i
think it will be very tolerable </s>
<s>  besides it will not much signify what
one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they
are going in a fortnight </s>
<s> 

are they indeed </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction </s>
<s> 

they are going to be encamped near brighton </s>
<s>  and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer </s>
<s>  it would be such a delicious scheme </s>
<s> 
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all </s>
<s>  mamma would like to
go too of all things </s>
<s>  only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have </s>
<s> 

yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed
and completely do for us at once </s>
<s>  good heaven </s>
<s>  brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton </s>
<s> 

now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down at
table </s>
<s>  what do you think </s>
<s>  it is excellent newscapital newsand about
a certain person we all like </s>
<s> 

jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need
not stay </s>
<s>  lydia laughed and said </s>
<s> 

aye that is just like your formality and discretion </s>
<s>  you thought the
waiter must not hear as if he cared </s>
<s>  i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say </s>
<s>  but he is an ugly fellow </s>
<s>  i am glad
he is gone </s>
<s>  i never saw such a long chin in my life </s>
<s>  well but now for
my news </s>
<s>  it is about dear wickham </s>
<s>  too good for the waiter is it not </s>
<s> 
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king </s>
<s>  theres for you </s>
<s>  she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool </s>
<s>  gone to stay </s>
<s>  wickham is safe </s>
<s> 

and mary king is safe </s>
<s>  added elizabeth </s>
<s>  safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune </s>
<s> 

she is a great fool for going away if she liked him </s>
<s> 

but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane </s>
<s> 

i am sure there is not on his </s>
<s>  i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled
thing </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal </s>
<s> 

as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was
ordered </s>
<s>  and after some contrivance the whole party with all their
boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and
lydias purchases were seated in it </s>
<s> 

how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia </s>
<s>  i am glad i bought my
bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox </s>
<s>  well now
let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way
home </s>
<s>  and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away </s>
<s>  have you seen any pleasant men </s>
<s>  have you had any
flirting </s>
<s>  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back </s>
<s>  jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare </s>
<s> 
she is almost threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  lord how ashamed i should be of not
being married before threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  my aunt phillips wants you so to
get husbands you cant think </s>
<s>  she says lizzy had better have taken <abvr>
collins </s>
<s>  but i do not think there would have been any fun in it </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s> 
how i should like to be married before any of you </s>
<s>  and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls </s>
<s>  dear me </s>
<s>  we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forsters </s>
<s>  kitty and me were to spend
the day there and <abvr> forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening </s>
<s>  by the bye <abvr> forster and me are such friends </s>
<s>  and so
she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen
was forced to come by herself </s>
<s>  and then what do you think we did </s>
<s>  we
dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady only think what fun </s>
<s>  not a soul knew of it but colonel and <abvr>
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns </s>
<s>  and you cannot imagine how well he looked </s>
<s>  when denny
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they
did not know him in the least </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s>  how i laughed </s>
<s>  and so did <abvr>
forster </s>
<s>  i thought i should have died </s>
<s>  and that made the men suspect
something and then they soon found out what was the matter </s>
<s> 

with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did
lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn </s>
<s>  elizabeth listened as little as she
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name </s>
<s> 

their reception at home was most kind </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty </s>
<s>  and more than once during dinner did <abvr> bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

i am glad you are come back lizzy </s>
<s> 

their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news </s>
<s>  and various were the subjects that
occupied them </s>
<s>  lady lucas was inquiring of maria after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was doubly engaged on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat
some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger
lucases </s>
<s>  and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun </s>
<s> 
as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there
was nobody in the coach </s>
<s>  and i should have gone so all the way if kitty
had not been sick </s>
<s>  and when we got to the george i do think we behaved
very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated
you too </s>
<s>  and then when we came away it was such fun </s>
<s>  i thought we never
should have got into the coach </s>
<s>  i was ready to die of laughter </s>
<s>  and then
we were so merry all the way home </s>
<s>  we talked and laughed so loud that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off </s>
<s> 

to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister
to depreciate such pleasures </s>
<s>  they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds </s>
<s>  but i confess they would have no charms for
mei should infinitely prefer a book </s>
<s> 

but of this answer lydia heard not a word </s>
<s>  she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all </s>
<s> 

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to meryton and to see how everybody went on </s>
<s>  but elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme </s>
<s>  it should not be said that the miss bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers </s>
<s> 
there was another reason too for her opposition </s>
<s>  she dreaded seeing <abvr>
wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible </s>
<s>  the
comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression </s>
<s>  in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account </s>
<s> 

she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under
frequent discussion between her parents </s>
<s>  elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding </s>
<s>  but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome </s>
<s>  and at length resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be
surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between <abvr> darcy and herself </s>
<s> 

miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural </s>
<s>  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings </s>
<s>  she was
sorry that <abvr> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them </s>
<s>  but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him </s>
<s> 

his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly
ought not to have appeared </s>
<s>  but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment </s>
<s> 

indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him </s>
<s>  but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me </s>
<s> 
you do not blame me however for refusing him </s>
<s> 

blame you </s>
<s>  oh no </s>
<s> 

but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham </s>
<s> 

noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did </s>
<s> 

but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next
day </s>
<s> 

she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham </s>
<s>  what a stroke was this for poor jane </s>
<s> 
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual </s>
<s>  nor was darcys vindication though
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery </s>
<s> 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and
seek to clear the one without involving the other </s>
<s> 

this will not do said elizabeth </s>
<s>  you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything </s>
<s>  take your choice but you must be satisfied
with only one </s>
<s>  there is but such a quantity of merit between them </s>
<s>  just
enough to make one good sort of man </s>
<s>  and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much </s>
<s>  for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys </s>
<s> 
but you shall do as you choose </s>
<s> 

it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane </s>
<s> 

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she </s>
<s>  wickham so
very bad </s>
<s>  it is almost past belief </s>
<s>  and poor <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  dear lizzy only
consider what he must have suffered </s>
<s>  such a disappointment </s>
<s>  and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too </s>
<s>  and having to relate such a thing
of his sister </s>
<s>  it is really too distressing </s>
<s>  i am sure you must feel it
so </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both </s>
<s>  i know you will do him such ample justice that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent </s>
<s>  your profusion
makes me saving </s>
<s>  and if you lament over him much longer my heart will
be as light as a feather </s>
<s> 

poor wickham </s>
<s>  there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance </s>
<s>  such an openness and gentleness in his manner </s>
<s> 

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men </s>
<s>  one has got all the goodness and the other all the
appearance of it </s>
<s> 

i never thought <abvr> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
used to do </s>
<s> 

and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him without any reason </s>
<s>  it is such a spur to ones genius such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind </s>
<s>  one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just </s>
<s>  but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty </s>
<s> 

lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now </s>
<s> 

indeed i could not </s>
<s>  i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy </s>
<s>  and
with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say
that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i
had </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  how i wanted you </s>
<s> 

how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to <abvr> darcy for now they do appear wholly
undeserved </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging </s>
<s>  there
is one point on which i want your advice </s>
<s>  i want to be told whether i
ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand
wickhams character </s>
<s> 

miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully </s>
<s>  what is your opinion </s>
<s> 

that it ought not to be attempted </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public </s>
<s>  on the contrary every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself </s>
<s>  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct who will believe me </s>
<s>  the general prejudice against <abvr> darcy
is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light </s>
<s>  i am not equal
to it </s>
<s>  wickham will soon be gone </s>
<s>  and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is </s>
<s>  some time hence it will be all found out
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before </s>
<s>  at
present i will say nothing about it </s>
<s> 

you are quite right </s>
<s>  to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever </s>
<s>  he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to
reestablish a character </s>
<s>  we must not make him desperate </s>
<s> 

the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation </s>
<s>  she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight
and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish
to talk again of either </s>
<s>  but there was still something lurking behind
of which prudence forbade the disclosure </s>
<s>  she dared not relate the other
half of <abvr> darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend </s>
<s>  here was knowledge in which no one
could partake </s>
<s>  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery </s>
<s>  and then said she if that very
improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to
tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself </s>
<s>  the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value </s>

state of her sisters spirits </s>

very tender affection for bingley </s>

in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment

<s> 

well lizzy said <abvr> bennet one day what is your opinion now of
this sad business of janes </s>
<s>  for my part i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody </s>
<s>  i told my sister phillips so the other day </s>
<s>  but
i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london </s>
<s>  well he is
a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now </s>
<s>  there is no talk of
his coming to netherfield again in the summer </s>
<s>  and i have inquired of
everybody too who is likely to know </s>
<s> 

i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more </s>
<s> 

oh well </s>
<s>  it is just as he chooses </s>
<s>  nobody wants him to come </s>
<s>  though i
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill </s>

would not have put up with it </s>
<s>  well my comfort is i am sure jane will
die of a broken heart </s>
<s>  and then he will be sorry for what he has done </s>
<s> 

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation
she made no answer </s>
<s> 

well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the
collinses live very comfortable do they </s>
<s>  well well i only hope
it will last </s>
<s>  and what sort of table do they keep </s>
<s>  charlotte is an
excellent manager i dare say </s>

no nothing at all </s>

a great deal of good management depend upon it </s>
<s>  yes yes they will
take care not to outrun their income </s>

it was a subject which they could not mention before me </s>
<s> 

no </s>

often talk of it between themselves </s>

chapter 


the first week of their return was soon gone </s>
<s>  the second began </s>
<s>  it was
the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace </s>
<s>  the dejection was almost
universal </s>
<s>  the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink
and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments </s>
<s>  very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such
hardheartedness in any of the family </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>  what is to become of us </s>
<s>  what are we to do </s>
<s>  would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe </s>
<s>  how can you be smiling so
lizzy </s>
<s> 

their affectionate mother shared all their grief </s>
<s>  she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years
ago </s>
<s> 

i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel
millers regiment went away </s>
<s>  i thought i should have broken my heart </s>
<s> 

i am sure i shall break mine said lydia </s>
<s> 

if one could but go to brighton </s>
<s>  observed <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> if one could but go to brighton </s>
<s>  but papa is so
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

a little seabathing would set me up forever </s>
<s> 

and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
 added kitty </s>
<s> 

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house </s>
<s>  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them </s>
<s>  but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame </s>
<s>  she felt anew the justice of <abvr> darcys
objections </s>
<s>  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend </s>
<s> 

but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away </s>
<s>  for she
received an invitation from <abvr> forster the wife of the colonel of
the regiment to accompany her to brighton </s>
<s>  this invaluable friend was a
very young woman and very lately married </s>
<s>  a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two </s>
<s> 

the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of <abvr> forster
the delight of <abvr> bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely
to be described </s>
<s>  wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever </s>
<s> 
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish </s>
<s> 

i cannot see why <abvr> forster should not ask me as well as lydia
 said she though i am not her particular friend </s>
<s>  i have just as much
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older </s>
<s> 

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make
her resigned </s>
<s>  as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter </s>
<s>  and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go </s>
<s>  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as <abvr> forster and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must
be greater than at home </s>
<s>  he heard her attentively and then said </s>
<s> 

lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances </s>
<s> 

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and
imprudent mannernay which has already arisen from it i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair </s>
<s> 

already arisen </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  what has she frightened away
some of your lovers </s>
<s>  poor little lizzy </s>
<s>  but do not be cast down </s>
<s>  such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret </s>
<s>  come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by lydias folly </s>
<s> 

indeed you are mistaken </s>
<s>  i have no such injuries to resent </s>
<s>  it is not
of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining </s>
<s>  our
importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydias character </s>
<s>  excuse me for i must speak plainly </s>
<s>  if you my dear
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment </s>
<s>  her character
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous </s>
<s>  a flirt too in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation </s>
<s>  without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person </s>
<s>  and from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite </s>
<s>  in this danger
kitty also is comprehended </s>
<s>  she will follow wherever lydia leads </s>
<s>  vain
ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  my dear father can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply </s>
<s> 

do not make yourself uneasy my love </s>
<s>  wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued </s>
<s>  and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly
sisters </s>
<s>  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton </s>
<s>  let her go then </s>
<s>  colonel forster is a sensible man and will
keep her out of any real mischief </s>
<s>  and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody </s>
<s>  at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here </s>
<s>  the officers will find
women better worth their notice </s>
<s>  let us hope therefore that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance </s>
<s>  at any rate she cannot grow
many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life </s>
<s> 

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content </s>
<s>  but her own opinion
continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry </s>
<s>  it was not
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them </s>
<s>  she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret
over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her
disposition </s>
<s> 

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility </s>
<s>  in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness </s>
<s>  she saw with the creative eye
of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers </s>
<s> 
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown </s>
<s>  she saw all the glories of the campits tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young
and the gay and dazzling with scarlet </s>
<s>  and to complete the view she
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once </s>
<s> 

had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these what would have been her sensations </s>
<s>  they could have
been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same </s>
<s> 
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself </s>
<s> 

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed </s>
<s>  and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving
home </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was now to see <abvr> wickham for the last time </s>
<s>  having been
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty
well over </s>
<s>  the agitations of former partiality entirely so </s>
<s>  she had even
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary </s>
<s>  in his present
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after
what had since passed to provoke her </s>
<s>  she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry </s>
<s>  and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal </s>
<s> 

on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined
with other of the officers at longbourn </s>
<s>  and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and <abvr> darcys having both spent three
weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former </s>
<s> 

he looked surprised displeased alarmed </s>
<s>  but with a moments
recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen
him often </s>
<s>  and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man
asked her how she had liked him </s>
<s>  her answer was warmly in his favour </s>
<s> 
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added </s>
<s> 

how long did you say he was at rosings </s>
<s> 

nearly three weeks </s>
<s> 

and you saw him frequently </s>
<s> 

yes almost every day </s>
<s> 

his manners are very different from his cousins </s>
<s> 

yes very different </s>
<s>  but i think <abvr> darcy improves upon acquaintance </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> wickham with a look which did not escape her </s>
<s>  and
pray may i ask </s>
<s>  but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is
it in address that he improves </s>
<s>  has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style </s>
<s> for i dare not hope he continued in a lower
and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  said elizabeth </s>
<s>  in essentials i believe he is very much
what he ever was </s>
<s> 

while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning </s>
<s>  there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention while she added </s>
<s> 

when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from
knowing him better his disposition was better understood </s>
<s> 

wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look </s>
<s>  for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his
embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of
accents </s>
<s> 

you who so well know my feeling towards <abvr> darcy will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right </s>
<s>  his pride in that direction
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by </s>
<s>  i only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been
alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe </s>
<s>  his fear of her has always
operated i know when they were together </s>
<s>  and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i
am certain he has very much at heart </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head </s>
<s>  she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge
him </s>
<s>  the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his
side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth </s>
<s>  and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again </s>
<s> 

when the party broke up lydia returned with <abvr> forster to meryton
from whence they were to set out early the next morning </s>
<s>  the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic </s>
<s>  kitty was the
only one who shed tears </s>
<s>  but she did weep from vexation and envy </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to </s>
<s>  and in
the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard </s>
<s> 



chapter 


had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort </s>
<s>  her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her </s>
<s>  respect
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever </s>
<s>  and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice </s>
<s>  he was fond of
the country and of books </s>
<s>  and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments </s>
<s>  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement </s>
<s>  this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife </s>
<s>  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given </s>
<s> 

elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her
fathers behaviour as a husband </s>
<s>  she had always seen it with pain </s>
<s>  but
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children was so highly reprehensible </s>
<s>  but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so illjudged a direction of talents </s>
<s>  talents which rightly used
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife </s>
<s> 

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment </s>
<s>  their parties
abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle </s>
<s>  and though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
wateringplace and a camp </s>
<s>  upon the whole therefore she found what
has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself </s>
<s>  it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the
present and prepare for another disappointment </s>
<s>  her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts </s>
<s>  it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable </s>
<s>  and could she have included jane in the
scheme every part of it would have been perfect </s>
<s> 

but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for </s>
<s> 
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain </s>
<s> 
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised </s>
<s>  a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful </s>
<s>  and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation </s>
<s> 

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty </s>
<s>  but her letters were always long expected and
always very short </s>
<s>  those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers
had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild </s>
<s>  that she had a new gown or a new parasol which
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry as <abvr> forster called her and they were going off to
the camp </s>
<s>  and from her correspondence with her sister there was still
less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public </s>
<s> 

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good
humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn </s>
<s>  everything wore
a happier aspect </s>
<s>  the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity </s>
<s>  and by the middle of
june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears </s>
<s>  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in
meryton </s>
<s> 

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter
arrived from <abvr> gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the
present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire </s>
<s>  in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks </s>
<s>  and to <abvr> gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction </s>
<s>  the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where
they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth
dovedale or the peak </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was excessively disappointed </s>
<s>  she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough </s>
<s>  but it
was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy </s>
<s> 
and all was soon right again </s>
<s> 

with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected </s>
<s>  it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner </s>
<s>  but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me </s>
<s> 

the period of expectation was now doubled </s>
<s>  four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunts arrival </s>
<s>  but they did pass away and <abvr>
and <abvr> gardiner with their four children did at length appear at
longbourn </s>
<s>  the children two girls of six and eight years old and two
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
wayteaching them playing with them and loving them </s>
<s> 

the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the
next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement </s>
<s> 
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions </s>
<s> 
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad </s>
<s> 

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay </s>
<s>  oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc </s>
<s>  are
sufficiently known </s>
<s>  a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern </s>
<s>  to the little town of lambton the scene of <abvr> gardiners
former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country </s>
<s>  and within five miles of lambton
elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated </s>
<s>  it was not
in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it </s>
<s>  in
talking over their route the evening before <abvr> gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner declared his
willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation </s>
<s> 

my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much </s>
<s>  said her aunt </s>
<s>  a place too with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected </s>
<s>  wickham passed all his youth there you
know </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was distressed </s>
<s>  she felt that she had no business at
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it </s>
<s>  she
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses </s>
<s>  after going over so
many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner abused her stupidity </s>
<s>  if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself </s>
<s>  but
the grounds are delightful </s>
<s>  they have some of the finest woods in the
country </s>
<s> 

elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce </s>
<s>  the
possibility of meeting <abvr> darcy while viewing the place instantly
occurred </s>
<s>  it would be dreadful </s>
<s>  she blushed at the very idea and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk </s>
<s>  but against this there were objections </s>
<s>  and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered </s>
<s> 

accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place </s>
<s>  what was the name of its
proprietor </s>
<s>  and with no little alarm whether the family were down for
the summer </s>
<s>  a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her
alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself </s>
<s>  and when the subject was revived the
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme </s>
<s>  to pemberley therefore they were to go </s>

chapter 


elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation </s>
<s>  and when at length they turned
in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter </s>
<s> 

the park was very large and contained great variety of ground </s>
<s>  they
entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent </s>
<s> 

elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view </s>
<s>  they gradually ascended for
halfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which
the road with some abruptness wound </s>
<s>  it was a large handsome stone
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills </s>
<s>  and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance </s>
<s>  its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned </s>
<s>  elizabeth was delighted </s>
<s>  she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste </s>
<s>  they were
all of them warm in their admiration </s>
<s>  and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something </s>
<s> 

they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door </s>
<s>  and
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned </s>
<s>  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken </s>
<s>  on applying to see the place they were admitted into the
hall </s>
<s>  and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was </s>
<s> 

the housekeeper came </s>
<s>  a respectablelooking elderly woman much less
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her </s>
<s>  they
followed her into the diningparlour </s>
<s>  it was a large well proportioned
room handsomely fitted up </s>
<s>  elizabeth after slightly surveying it went
to a window to enjoy its prospect </s>
<s>  the hill crowned with wood which
they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance
was a beautiful object </s>
<s>  every disposition of the ground was good </s>
<s>  and
she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it
with delight </s>
<s>  as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions </s>
<s>  but from every window there were beauties to be
seen </s>
<s>  the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor </s>
<s>  but elizabeth saw with admiration of
his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine </s>
<s>  with less of
splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings </s>
<s> 

and of this place thought she i might have been mistress </s>
<s>  with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted </s>
<s>  instead of
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  but norecollecting
herselfthat could never be </s>
<s>  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me </s>
<s>  i should not have been allowed to invite them </s>
<s> 

this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like
regret </s>
<s> 

she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent but had not the courage for it </s>
<s>  at length however the question
was asked by her uncle </s>
<s>  and she turned away with alarm while <abvr>
reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with
a large party of friends </s>
<s>  how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day </s>
<s> 

her aunt now called her to look at a picture </s>
<s>  she approached and saw the
likeness of <abvr> wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures
over the mantelpiece </s>
<s>  her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it </s>
<s> 
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought
up by him at his own expense </s>
<s>  he is now gone into the army she added </s>
<s> 
but i am afraid he has turned out very wild </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not
return it </s>
<s> 

and that said <abvr> reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures
is my masterand very like him </s>
<s>  it was drawn at the same time as the
otherabout eight years ago </s>
<s> 

i have heard much of your masters fine person said <abvr> gardiner
looking at the picture </s>
<s>  it is a handsome face </s>
<s>  but lizzy you can tell
us whether it is like or not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master </s>
<s> 

does that young lady know <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth coloured and said </s>
<s>  a little </s>
<s> 

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam </s>
<s> 

yes very handsome </s>
<s> 

i am sure i know none so handsome </s>
<s>  but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer larger picture of him than this </s>
<s>  this room was my late
masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then </s>
<s>  he was very fond of them </s>
<s> 

this accounted to elizabeth for <abvr> wickhams being among them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn
when she was only eight years old </s>
<s> 

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen </s>
<s>  and so
accomplished </s>
<s> she plays and sings all day long </s>
<s>  in the next room is
a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master </s>
<s>  she
comes here tomorrow with him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks </s>
<s>  <abvr> reynolds either
by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister </s>
<s> 

is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year </s>
<s> 

not so much as i could wish sir </s>
<s>  but i dare say he may spend half his
time here </s>
<s>  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months </s>
<s> 

except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate </s>
<s> 

if your master would marry you might see more of him </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>
<s>  but i do not know when that will be </s>
<s>  i do not know who is
good enough for him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gardiner smiled </s>
<s>  elizabeth could not help saying it is
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so </s>
<s> 

i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him
 replied the other </s>
<s>  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far </s>
<s>  and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have
never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever
since he was four years old </s>
<s> 

this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her
ideas </s>
<s>  that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion </s>
<s> 
her keenest attention was awakened </s>
<s>  she longed to hear more and was
grateful to her uncle for saying </s>
<s> 

there are very few people of whom so much can be said </s>
<s>  you are lucky in
having such a master </s>
<s> 

yes sir i know i am </s>
<s>  if i were to go through the world i could
not meet with a better </s>
<s>  but i have always observed that they who are
goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up </s>
<s>  and
he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the
world </s>
<s> 

elizabeth almost stared at her </s>
<s>  can this be <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  thought she </s>
<s> 

his father was an excellent man said <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s> 

yes maam that he was indeed </s>
<s>  and his son will be just like himjust
as affable to the poor </s>
<s> 

elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more </s>
<s>  <abvr>
reynolds could interest her on no other point </s>
<s>  she related the subjects
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the
furniture in vain </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master soon led again to the subject </s>
<s>  and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase </s>
<s> 

he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever
lived </s>
<s>  not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but
themselves </s>
<s>  there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name </s>
<s>  some people call him proud </s>
<s>  but i am sure i never saw
anything of it </s>
<s>  to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men </s>
<s> 

in what an amiable light does this place him </s>
<s>  thought elizabeth </s>
<s> 

this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend </s>
<s> 

perhaps we might be deceived </s>
<s> 

that is not very likely </s>
<s>  our authority was too good </s>
<s> 

on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below </s>
<s>  and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when
last at pemberley </s>
<s> 

he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards
one of the windows </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter
the room </s>
<s>  and this is always the way with him she added </s>
<s>  whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment </s>
<s>  there
is nothing he would not do for her </s>
<s> 

the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were
all that remained to be shown </s>
<s>  in the former were many good paintings </s>
<s> 
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art </s>
<s>  and from such as had been already
visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and
also more intelligible </s>
<s> 

in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger </s>
<s>  elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her </s>
<s>  at last it arrested
herand she beheld a striking resemblance to <abvr> darcy with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her </s>
<s>  she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest
contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers
lifetime </s>
<s> 

there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance </s>
<s>  the commendation bestowed on him by <abvr> reynolds
was of no trifling nature </s>
<s>  what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant </s>
<s>  as a brother a landlord a master she
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship </s>
<s> how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow </s>
<s> how much of
good or evil must be done by him </s>
<s>  every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his
eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before </s>
<s>  she remembered its warmth and
softened its impropriety of expression </s>
<s> 

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen
they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were
consigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor </s>
<s> 

as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back
to look again </s>
<s>  her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables </s>
<s> 

they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight </s>
<s>  their eyes
instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush </s>
<s>  he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise </s>
<s>  but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party
and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least
of perfect civility </s>
<s> 

she had instinctively turned away </s>
<s>  but stopping on his approach
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome </s>
<s>  had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw <abvr> darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on
beholding his master must immediately have told it </s>
<s>  they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family </s>
<s>  amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment </s>
<s>  and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life </s>
<s>  nor did he seem much more at ease </s>
<s>  when he spoke his accent
had none of its usual sedateness </s>
<s>  and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed in
derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts </s>
<s> 

at length every idea seemed to fail him </s>
<s>  and after standing a few
moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took
leave </s>
<s> 

the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure </s>
<s>  but
elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings
followed them in silence </s>
<s>  she was overpowered by shame and vexation </s>
<s>  her
coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the
world </s>
<s>  how strange it must appear to him </s>
<s>  in what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man </s>
<s>  it might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  why did she come </s>
<s>  or why did he
thus come a day before he was expected </s>
<s>  had they been only ten minutes
sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination </s>
<s> 
for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage </s>
<s>  she blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting </s>
<s>  and his behaviour so strikingly
alteredwhat could it mean </s>
<s>  that he should even speak to her was
amazing </s>
<s> but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family </s>
<s> 
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting </s>
<s>  what
a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put
his letter into her hand </s>
<s>  she knew not what to think or how to account
for it </s>
<s> 

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching </s>
<s>  but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it </s>
<s>  and though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she
distinguished no part of the scene </s>
<s>  her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where <abvr> darcy then
was </s>
<s>  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything
she was still dear to him </s>
<s>  perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease </s>
<s>  yet there had been that in his voice which was
not like ease </s>
<s>  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with
composure </s>
<s> 

at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself </s>
<s> 

they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while
ascended some of the higher grounds </s>
<s>  when in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the
valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading
many and occasionally part of the stream </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk </s>
<s> 
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round </s>
<s> 
it settled the matter </s>
<s>  and they pursued the accustomed circuit </s>
<s>  which
brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods
to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts </s>
<s>  they crossed
it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene </s>
<s> 
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited </s>
<s>  and the
valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it </s>
<s> 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings </s>
<s>  but when they had crossed the
bridge and perceived their distance from the house <abvr> gardiner
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible </s>
<s>  her niece was
therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction </s>
<s>  but their
progress was slow for <abvr> gardiner though seldom able to indulge the
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the
man about them that he advanced but little </s>
<s>  whilst wandering on in this
slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of <abvr> darcy
approaching them and at no great distance </s>
<s>  the walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before
they met </s>
<s>  elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared
for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness if he really intended to meet them </s>
<s>  for a few moments indeed
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path </s>
<s>  the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view </s>
<s>  the
turning past he was immediately before them </s>
<s>  with a glance she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility </s>
<s>  and to imitate his
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place </s>
<s> 
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when
some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed </s>
<s>  her colour changed
and she said no more </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner was standing a little behind </s>
<s>  and on her pausing he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends </s>
<s> 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared </s>
<s> 
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself </s>
<s>  what will be his surprise thought
she when he knows who they are </s>
<s>  he takes them now for people of
fashion </s>
<s> 

the introduction however was immediately made </s>
<s>  and as she named their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions </s>
<s>  that he was surprised by the
connection was evident </s>
<s>  he sustained it however with fortitude and
so far from going away turned back with them and entered into
conversation with <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  elizabeth could not but be pleased
could not but triumph </s>
<s>  it was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush </s>
<s>  she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence
his taste or his good manners </s>
<s> 

the conversation soon turned upon fishing </s>
<s>  and she heard <abvr> darcy
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner who was
walking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder </s>
<s> 
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly </s>
<s>  the compliment
must be all for herself </s>
<s>  her astonishment however was extreme and
continually was she repeating why is he so altered </s>
<s>  from what can
it proceed </s>
<s>  it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that his
manners are thus softened </s>
<s>  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a
change as this </s>
<s>  it is impossible that he should still love me </s>
<s> 

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration </s>
<s>  it originated
in <abvr> gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found
elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred
her husbands </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on
together </s>
<s>  after a short silence the lady first spoke </s>
<s>  she wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that
you would certainly not be here till tomorrow </s>
<s>  and indeed before we
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country </s>
<s>  he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling </s>
<s>  they
will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with youmr </s>
<s>  bingley and his sisters </s>
<s> 

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow </s>
<s>  her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when <abvr> bingleys name had been the last
mentioned between them </s>
<s>  and if she might judge by his complexion his
mind was not very differently engaged </s>
<s> 

there is also one other person in the party he continued after a
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you </s>
<s>  will you allow
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton </s>
<s> 

the surprise of such an application was great indeed </s>
<s>  it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it </s>
<s>  she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was
satisfactory </s>
<s>  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her </s>
<s> 

they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought </s>
<s>  elizabeth
was not comfortable </s>
<s>  that was impossible </s>
<s>  but she was flattered and
pleased </s>
<s>  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind </s>
<s>  they soon outstripped the others and when they had
reached the carriage <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind </s>
<s> 

he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not
tired and they stood together on the lawn </s>
<s>  at such a time much might
have been said and silence was very awkward </s>
<s>  she wanted to talk but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject </s>
<s>  at last she recollected
that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale
with great perseverance </s>
<s>  yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete was
over </s>
<s>  on <abvr> and <abvr> gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment </s>
<s>  but this was declined and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage </s>
<s>  and when it drove off elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house </s>
<s> 

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began </s>
<s>  and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected </s>
<s> 
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle </s>
<s> 

there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming </s>
<s>  i can now
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i
have seen nothing of it </s>
<s> 

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us </s>
<s>  it was more
than civil </s>
<s>  it was really attentive </s>
<s>  and there was no necessity for such
attention </s>
<s>  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling </s>
<s> 

to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham </s>
<s> 
or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features
are perfectly good </s>
<s>  but how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could </s>
<s>  said that she had liked
him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning </s>
<s> 

but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied
her uncle </s>
<s>  your great men often are </s>
<s>  and therefore i shall not take him
at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off
his grounds </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but
said nothing </s>
<s> 

from what we have seen of him continued <abvr> gardiner i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham </s>
<s>  he has not an illnatured look </s>
<s> 
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks </s>
<s>  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart </s>
<s>  but to be sure the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character </s>
<s> 
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes </s>
<s>  but he is a liberal
master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue </s>
<s> 

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham </s>
<s>  and therefore gave them to understand in
as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from
his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different
construction </s>
<s>  and that his character was by no means so faulty nor
wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  in
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner was surprised and concerned </s>
<s>  but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection </s>
<s>  and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else </s>
<s>  fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance </s>
<s> 

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends </s>
<s>  and she could do nothing
but think and think with wonder of <abvr> darcys civility and above
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth had settled it that <abvr> darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley </s>
<s>  and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning </s>
<s> 
but her conclusion was false </s>
<s>  for on the very morning after their
arrival at lambton these visitors came </s>
<s>  they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street </s>
<s>  elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected </s>
<s>  her uncle and aunt were all amazement </s>
<s>  and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on
the business </s>
<s>  nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece </s>
<s>  while these
newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of
elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing </s>
<s>  she was quite
amazed at her own discomposure </s>
<s>  but amongst other causes of disquiet
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour </s>
<s>  and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her </s>
<s> 

she retreated from the window fearful of being seen </s>
<s>  and as she walked
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse </s>
<s> 

miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction
took place </s>
<s>  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself </s>
<s>  since her
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud </s>
<s> 
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy </s>
<s>  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable </s>
<s> 

miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth </s>
<s>  and though
little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance
womanly and graceful </s>
<s>  she was less handsome than her brother </s>
<s>  but there
was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle </s>
<s>  elizabeth who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <abvr> darcy had been was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings </s>
<s> 

they had not long been together before <abvr> darcy told her that bingley
was also coming to wait on her </s>
<s>  and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick
step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room </s>
<s>  all
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away </s>
<s>  but had she still
felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again </s>
<s>  he
inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked
and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself </s>
<s>  they had long wished to see him </s>
<s>  the whole party before
them indeed excited a lively attention </s>
<s>  the suspicions which had just
arisen of <abvr> darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry </s>
<s>  and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love </s>
<s>  of the ladys sensations they remained a little
in doubt </s>
<s>  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough </s>
<s> 

elizabeth on her side had much to do </s>
<s>  she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors </s>
<s>  she wanted to compose her own and
to make herself agreeable to all </s>
<s>  and in the latter object where she
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour </s>
<s>  bingley
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased </s>
<s> 

in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister </s>
<s>  and oh </s>
<s> 
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner </s>
<s>  sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance </s>
<s>  but
though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane </s>
<s>  no look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard </s>
<s>  nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister </s>
<s>  on this point
she was soon satisfied </s>
<s>  and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a
recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared </s>
<s>  he observed
to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone
which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her </s>
<s>  and before she could reply
he added it is above eight months </s>
<s>  we have not met since the th of
november when we were all dancing together at netherfield </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact </s>
<s>  and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether
all her sisters were at longbourn </s>
<s>  there was not much in the question
nor in the preceding remark </s>
<s>  but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning </s>
<s> 

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on <abvr> darcy himself </s>
<s> 
but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day </s>
<s>  when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change was
so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible </s>
<s>  never even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations
at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from
selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings </s>
<s> 

their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour </s>
<s>  and when they arose
to depart <abvr> darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner and miss bennet to dinner
at pemberley before they left the country </s>
<s>  miss darcy though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations
readily obeyed </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its
acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head </s>
<s>  presuming however
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of
society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on </s>
<s> 

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends </s>
<s>  elizabeth construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on
this account as well as some others found herself when their
visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little </s>
<s>  eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress </s>
<s> 

but she had no reason to fear <abvr> and <abvr> gardiners curiosity </s>
<s>  it was
not their wish to force her communication </s>
<s>  it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with <abvr> darcy than they had before any idea of </s>
<s> 
it was evident that he was very much in love with her </s>
<s>  they saw much to
interest but nothing to justify inquiry </s>
<s> 

of <abvr> darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well </s>
<s>  and as far
as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find </s>
<s>  they could
not be untouched by his politeness </s>
<s>  and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  there was now an interest
however in believing the housekeeper </s>
<s>  and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be
hastily rejected </s>
<s>  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight </s>
<s>  they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride </s>
<s>  pride he probably had and if not
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown
where the family did not visit </s>
<s>  it was acknowledged however that he
was a liberal man and did much good among the poor </s>
<s> 

with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation </s>
<s>  for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind
him which <abvr> darcy afterwards discharged </s>
<s> 

as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last </s>
<s>  and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion </s>
<s> 
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out </s>
<s>  she
certainly did not hate him </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  hatred had vanished long ago and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him
that could be so called </s>
<s>  the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling </s>
<s>  and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in
his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light
which yesterday had produced </s>
<s>  but above all above respect and esteem
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked </s>
<s> 
it was gratitude </s>
<s>  gratitude not merely for having once loved her
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection </s>
<s>  he who she had been persuaded would avoid
her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most
eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display
of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only
were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent
on making her known to his sister </s>
<s>  such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent
love it must be attributed </s>
<s>  and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be
exactly defined </s>
<s>  she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him
she felt a real interest in his welfare </s>
<s>  and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her
fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses </s>
<s> 

it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled
by some exertion of politeness on their side </s>
<s>  and consequently that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning </s>
<s>  they were therefore to go </s>
<s>  elizabeth was pleased </s>
<s>  though when
she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply </s>

mr </s>

<s>  the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon </s>

chapter 


convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had
originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how
much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed </s>
<s> 

on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer </s>
<s>  its windows
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn </s>
<s> 

in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there
with <abvr> hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in
london </s>
<s>  georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with
all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner and her niece
however did her justice and pitied her </s>
<s> 

by <abvr> hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey </s>
<s>  and
on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be
succeeded for a few moments </s>
<s>  it was first broken by <abvr> annesley a
genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the
others </s>
<s>  and between her and <abvr> gardiner with occasional help from
elizabeth the conversation was carried on </s>
<s>  miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it </s>
<s>  and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard </s>
<s> 

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without
calling her attention </s>
<s>  this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance </s>
<s>  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much </s>
<s>  her own thoughts were employing her </s>
<s>  she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room </s>
<s>  she wished she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them </s>
<s>  and whether
she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine </s>
<s>  after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss
bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family </s>
<s>  she answered with equal
indifference and brevity and the other said no more </s>
<s> 

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season </s>
<s>  but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from <abvr> annesley to miss darcy had been
given to remind her of her post </s>
<s>  there was now employment for the whole
partyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat </s>
<s>  and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected
them round the table </s>
<s> 

while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of <abvr> darcy by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room </s>
<s>  and then though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to
regret that he came </s>
<s> 

he had been some time with <abvr> gardiner who with two or three other
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning </s>
<s>  no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed </s>
<s>  a resolution the more
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room </s>
<s>  in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects </s>
<s>  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions
to <abvr> darcy were by no means over </s>
<s>  miss darcy on her brothers
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side </s>
<s>  miss
bingley saw all this likewise </s>
<s>  and in the imprudence of anger took the
first opportunity of saying with sneering civility </s>
<s> 

pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton </s>
<s> 
they must be a great loss to your family </s>
<s> 

in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name </s>
<s>  but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts </s>
<s>  and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress </s>
<s> 
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone </s>
<s>  while
she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened
complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes </s>
<s>  had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint </s>
<s>  but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps </s>
<s>  not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys
meditated elopement </s>
<s>  to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy
was possible except to elizabeth </s>
<s>  and from all bingleys connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very
wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming
hereafter her own </s>
<s>  he had certainly formed such a plan and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend </s>
<s> 

elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion </s>
<s>  and
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to
wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able
to speak any more </s>
<s>  her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully </s>
<s> 

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned </s>
<s>  and while <abvr> darcy was attending them to their carriage miss
bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person
behaviour and dress </s>
<s>  but georgiana would not join her </s>
<s>  her brothers
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour </s>
<s>  his judgement could not
err </s>
<s>  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable </s>
<s>  when
darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister </s>
<s> 

how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning <abvr> darcy she
cried </s>
<s>  i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter </s>
<s>  she is grown so brown and coarse </s>
<s>  louisa and i were agreeing
that we should not have known her again </s>
<s> 

however little <abvr> darcy might have liked such an address he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer </s>
<s> 

for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could
see any beauty in her </s>
<s>  her face is too thin </s>
<s>  her complexion has no
brilliancy </s>
<s>  and her features are not at all handsome </s>
<s>  her nose
wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines </s>
<s>  her teeth are
tolerable but not out of the common way </s>
<s>  and as for her eyes
which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything
extraordinary in them </s>
<s>  they have a sharp shrewish look which i do
not like at all </s>
<s>  and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency
without fashion which is intolerable </s>
<s> 

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not
the best method of recommending herself </s>
<s>  but angry people are not always
wise </s>
<s>  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the
success she expected </s>
<s>  he was resolutely silent however and from a
determination of making him speak she continued </s>
<s> 

i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty </s>
<s>  and i particularly recollect
your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield ˜she
a beauty </s>
<s> i should as soon call her mother a wit </s>
<s>  but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time </s>
<s> 

yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that
was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance </s>
<s> 

he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them
both </s>
<s>  the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention </s>
<s>  they talked
of his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything but
himself </s>
<s>  yet elizabeth was longing to know what <abvr> gardiner thought of
him and <abvr> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces
beginning the subject </s>

elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton </s>
<s>  and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there </s>
<s>  but
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere </s>
<s>  elizabeth was not surprised at it as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill </s>
<s> 

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in </s>
<s>  and
her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by
themselves </s>
<s>  the one missent must first be attended to </s>
<s>  it had been
written five days ago </s>
<s>  the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded </s>
<s> 
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident
agitation gave more important intelligence </s>
<s>  it was to this effect </s>
<s> 

since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature </s>
<s>  but i am afraid of alarming yoube
assured that we are all well </s>
<s>  what i have to say relates to poor lydia </s>
<s> 
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed
from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers </s>
<s>  to own the truth with wickham </s>
<s>  imagine our
surprise </s>
<s>  to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected </s>
<s>  i am
very very sorry </s>
<s>  so imprudent a match on both sides </s>
<s>  but i am willing
to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood </s>
<s> 
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step
and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart </s>
<s>  his choice is
disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing </s>
<s> 
our poor mother is sadly grieved </s>
<s>  my father bears it better </s>
<s>  how
thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against
him </s>
<s>  we must forget it ourselves </s>
<s>  they were off saturday night about
twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight </s>
<s>  the express was sent off directly </s>
<s>  my dear lizzy they must have
passed within ten miles of us </s>
<s>  colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon </s>
<s>  lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of
their intention </s>
<s>  i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor
mother </s>
<s>  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly
know what i have written </s>
<s> 

without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing
what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows </s>
<s>  it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first </s>
<s> 

by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter </s>

wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my

day before not many hours after the express </s>

<s>  he did trace them easily to clapham
but no further </s>
<s>  for on entering that place they removed into a hackney
coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom </s>

them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but

<s>  our

<s>  cried elizabeth darting from her seat
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing
a moment of the time so precious </s>
<s>  but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant and <abvr> darcy appeared </s>
<s>  her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak
she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation
hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you </s>

elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them </s>
<s>  calling back
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly </s>
<s> 

on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her

some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn </s>

she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could
not speak another word </s>

something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate
silence </s>

when my eyes were opened to his real characteroh </s>
<s>  had i known what
i ought what i dared to do </s>
<s>  but i knew noti was afraid of doing too
much </s>
<s>  wretched wretched mistake </s>
<s> 

darcy made no answer </s>
<s>  he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air
gloomy </s>
<s>  elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it </s>
<s>  her
power was sinking </s>
<s>  everything must sink under such a proof of family
weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace </s>
<s>  she could neither
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress </s>
<s>  it
was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes </s>
<s>  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him as now when all love must be vain </s>
<s> 

but self though it would intrude could not engross her </s>
<s>  lydiathe
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed
up every private care </s>
<s>  and covering her face with her handkerchief
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else </s>
<s>  and after a pause of
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my
stay but real though unavailing concern </s>
<s>  would to heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress </s>
<s>  but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks </s>
<s>  this unfortunate affair will i
fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley
today </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy </s>
<s>  say that
urgent business calls us home immediately </s>
<s>  conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible i know it cannot be long </s>
<s> 

he readily assured her of his secrecy </s>
<s>  again expressed his sorrow for
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only
one serious parting look went away </s>
<s> 

as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in derbyshire </s>
<s>  and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full
of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination </s>
<s> 

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty </s>
<s>  but if
otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object and even before two words have been
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham
and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment </s>
<s>  be that as it may she saw him
go with regret </s>
<s>  and in this early example of what lydias infamy must
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business </s>
<s>  never since reading janes second letter had she entertained
a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her </s>
<s>  no one but jane she thought
could flatter herself with such an expectation </s>
<s>  surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development </s>
<s>  while the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money </s>
<s>  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible </s>
<s>  but now it was all too natural </s>
<s>  for such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms </s>
<s>  and though she did not suppose
lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey </s>
<s> 

she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that
lydia had any partiality for him </s>
<s>  but she was convinced that lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody </s>
<s>  sometimes one
officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions
raised them in her opinion </s>
<s>  her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object </s>
<s>  the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh </s>
<s>  how acutely did she now
feel it </s>
<s> 

she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and
requiring constant attendance </s>
<s>  and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost
importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe </s>
<s>  <abvr>
and <abvr> gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill </s>
<s>  but satisfying them
instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy </s>
<s> though lydia had never been a
favourite with them <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted </s>
<s>  not lydia only but all were concerned in it </s>
<s>  and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror <abvr> gardiner promised every
assistance in his power </s>
<s>  elizabeth though expecting no less thanked
him with tears of gratitude </s>
<s>  and all three being actuated by one spirit
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled </s>
<s>  they were to
be off as soon as possible </s>
<s>  but what is to be done about pemberley </s>
<s> 
 cried <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  john told us <abvr> darcy was here when you sent for
us </s>
<s>  was it so </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement </s>
<s> 
that is all settled </s>
<s> 

what is all settled </s>
<s>  repeated the other as she ran into her room to
prepare </s>
<s>  and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth </s>
<s>  oh that i knew how it was </s>
<s> 

but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour </s>
<s>  had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself </s>
<s>  but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their
sudden departure </s>
<s>  an hour however saw the whole completed </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing
remained to be done but to go </s>
<s>  and elizabeth after all the misery of
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn </s>
<s> 



chapter 


i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they
drove from the town </s>
<s>  and really upon serious consideration i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter </s>
<s>  it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best </s>
<s>  could he expect that her friends
would not step forward </s>
<s>  could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster </s>
<s>  his temptation is
not adequate to the risk </s>
<s> 

do you really think so </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment </s>
<s> 

upon my word said <abvr> gardiner i begin to be of your uncles
opinion </s>
<s>  it is really too great a violation of decency honour and
interest for him to be guilty of </s>
<s>  i cannot think so very ill of
wickham </s>
<s>  can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe
him capable of it </s>
<s> 

not perhaps of neglecting his own interest </s>
<s>  but of every other
neglect i can believe him capable </s>
<s>  if indeed it should be so </s>
<s>  but i
dare not hope it </s>
<s>  why should they not go on to scotland if that had been
the case </s>
<s> 

in the first place replied <abvr> gardiner there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption </s>
<s>  and besides no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road </s>
<s> 

well thensupposing them to be in london </s>
<s>  they may be there though
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose </s>
<s>  it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side </s>
<s>  and it
might strike them that they could be more economically though less
expeditiously married in london than in scotland </s>
<s> 

but why all this secrecy </s>
<s>  why any fear of detection </s>
<s>  why must their
marriage be private </s>
<s>  oh no nothis is not likely </s>
<s>  his most particular
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her </s>
<s>  wickham will never marry a woman without some money </s>
<s>  he
cannot afford it </s>
<s>  and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well </s>
<s>  as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge </s>
<s>  for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce </s>
<s>  but as to your
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good </s>
<s>  lydia has
no brothers to step forward </s>
<s>  and he might imagine from my fathers
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in
such a matter </s>
<s> 

but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage </s>
<s> 

it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with
tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt </s>
<s>  but really i know not what to say </s>
<s> 
perhaps i am not doing her justice </s>
<s>  but she is very young </s>
<s>  she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects </s>
<s>  and for the last halfyear
nay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity </s>
<s>  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way </s>
<s> 
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love
flirtation and officers have been in her head </s>
<s>  she has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give
greaterwhat shall i call it </s>
<s>  susceptibility to her feelings </s>
<s>  which are
naturally lively enough </s>
<s>  and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman </s>
<s> 

but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt </s>
<s> 

of whom does jane ever think ill </s>
<s>  and who is there whatever might be
their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt
till it were proved against them </s>
<s>  but jane knows as well as i do what
wickham really is </s>
<s>  we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word </s>
<s>  that he has neither integrity nor honour </s>
<s>  that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating </s>
<s> 

and do you really know all this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> gardiner whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive </s>
<s> 

i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring </s>
<s>  i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  and you yourself when last at
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him </s>
<s>  and there are other
circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to
relate </s>
<s>  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless </s>
<s>  from
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud
reserved disagreeable girl </s>
<s>  yet he knew to the contrary himself </s>
<s>  he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her </s>
<s> 

but does lydia know nothing of this </s>
<s>  can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> that that is the worst of all </s>
<s>  till i was in kent and saw
so much both of <abvr> darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was
ignorant of the truth myself </s>
<s>  and when i returned home the shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time </s>
<s>  as that was the
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public </s>
<s>  for of what use could
it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown </s>
<s>  and even when it was
settled that lydia should go with <abvr> forster the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me </s>
<s>  that she could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head </s>
<s>  that such a
consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts </s>
<s> 

when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i
suppose to believe them fond of each other </s>
<s> 

not the slightest </s>
<s>  i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side </s>
<s>  and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away </s>
<s>  when first
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him </s>
<s>  but so we all
were </s>
<s>  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months </s>
<s>  but he never distinguished her by any particular
attention </s>
<s>  and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment
who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites </s>
<s> 

                              

it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during
the whole of the journey </s>
<s>  from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent </s>
<s> 
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness </s>
<s> 

they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night
on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day </s>
<s>  it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations </s>
<s> 

the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock </s>
<s>  and when the
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome </s>
<s> 

elizabeth jumped out </s>
<s>  and after giving each of them a hasty kiss
hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her
mothers apartment immediately met her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the
eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives </s>
<s> 

not yet replied jane </s>
<s>  but now that my dear uncle is come i hope
everything will be well </s>
<s> 

is my father in town </s>
<s> 

yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word </s>
<s> 

and have you heard from him often </s>
<s> 

we have heard only twice </s>
<s>  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i
particularly begged him to do </s>
<s>  he merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention </s>
<s> 

and my motherhow is she </s>
<s>  how are you all </s>
<s> 

my mother is tolerably well i trust </s>
<s>  though her spirits are greatly
shaken </s>
<s>  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all </s>
<s>  she does not yet leave her dressingroom </s>
<s>  mary and kitty thank
heaven are quite well </s>
<s> 

but youhow are you </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  you look pale </s>
<s>  how much you
must have gone through </s>
<s> 

her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well </s>
<s>  and their
conversation which had been passing while <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner were
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party </s>
<s>  jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears </s>
<s> 

when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give </s>
<s>  the sanguine hope of
good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her </s>
<s>  she still expected that it would all end well and that
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected </s>
<s>  with
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage </s>
<s> 
blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing </s>
<s> 

if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton
with all my family this would not have happened </s>
<s>  but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her </s>
<s>  why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight </s>
<s>  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after </s>
<s>  i always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her </s>
<s>  but i was overruled as i always am </s>
<s>  poor dear child </s>
<s> 
and now heres <abvr> bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become
of us all </s>
<s>  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we
shall do </s>
<s> 

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gardiner after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist <abvr>
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia </s>
<s> 

do not give way to useless alarm added he </s>
<s>  though it is right to be
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain </s>
<s> 
it is not quite a week since they left brighton </s>
<s>  in a few days more we
may gain some news of them </s>
<s>  and till we know that they are not married
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as
lost </s>
<s>  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make
him come home with me to gracechurch street </s>
<s>  and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear brother replied <abvr> bennet that is exactly what i
could most wish for </s>
<s>  and now do when you get to town find them out
wherever they may be </s>
<s>  and if they are not married already make them
marry </s>
<s>  and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them
after they are married </s>
<s>  and above all keep <abvr> bennet from fighting </s>
<s> 
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my
witsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch
spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that
i can get no rest by night nor by day </s>
<s>  and tell my dear lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does
not know which are the best warehouses </s>
<s>  oh brother how kind you are </s>
<s>  i
know you will contrive it all </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well
in her hopes as her fear </s>
<s>  and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters </s>
<s> 

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to
oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject </s>
<s> 

in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before </s>
<s>  one came from her books and the other from her toilette </s>
<s>  the
faces of both however were tolerably calm </s>
<s>  and no change was visible
in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty </s>
<s>  as for mary she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance
of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table </s>
<s> 

this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of </s>
<s> 
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation </s>
<s> 

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful
lesson </s>
<s>  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable </s>
<s>  that one
false step involves her in endless ruin </s>
<s>  that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful </s>
<s>  and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex </s>
<s> 

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed
to make any reply </s>
<s>  mary however continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them </s>
<s> 

in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for
halfanhour by themselves </s>
<s>  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy </s>
<s>  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued
the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which
i have not already heard </s>
<s>  give me further particulars </s>
<s>  what did colonel
forster say </s>
<s>  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place </s>
<s>  they must have seen them together for ever </s>
<s> 

colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm </s>
<s>  i am so
grieved for him </s>
<s>  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost </s>
<s>  he
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland </s>
<s>  when that apprehension
first got abroad it hastened his journey </s>
<s> 

and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry </s>
<s>  did he know of
their intending to go off </s>
<s>  had colonel forster seen denny himself </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of
their plans and would not give his real opinion about it </s>
<s>  he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before </s>
<s> 

and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a
doubt i suppose of their being really married </s>
<s> 

how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains </s>
<s>  i felt
a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him
in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right </s>
<s>  my father and mother knew nothing of that </s>
<s>  they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be </s>
<s>  kitty then owned with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter
she had prepared her for such a step </s>
<s>  she had known it seems of their
being in love with each other many weeks </s>
<s> 

but not before they went to brighton </s>
<s> 

no i believe not </s>
<s> 

and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself </s>
<s>  does
he know his real character </s>
<s> 

i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did </s>
<s>  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant </s>
<s>  and since this sad
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt </s>
<s> 
but i hope this may be false </s>
<s> 

oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him
this could not have happened </s>
<s> 

perhaps it would have been better replied her sister </s>
<s>  but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were seemed unjustifiable </s>
<s>  we acted with the best intentions </s>
<s> 

could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his
wife </s>
<s> 

he brought it with him for us to see </s>
<s> 

jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth </s>
<s>  these
were the contents </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet

you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am
missed </s>
<s>  i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who
i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i
love and he is an angel </s>
<s>  i should never be happy without him so think
it no harm to be off </s>
<s>  you need not send them word at longbourn of my
going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater
when i write to them and sign my name ˜lydia wickham </s>
<s>  what a good joke
it will be </s>
<s>  i can hardly write for laughing </s>
<s>  pray make my excuses to
pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight </s>
<s> 
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all </s>
<s>  and tell him i will
dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure </s>
<s>  i shall
send for my clothes when i get to longbourn </s>
<s>  but i wish you would tell
sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up </s>

<s>  give my love to colonel forster </s>
<s>  i hope you will
drink to our good journey </s>

finished it </s>
<s>  what a letter is this to be written at such a moment </s>
<s> 
but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their
journey </s>
<s>  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her
side a scheme of infamy </s>
<s>  my poor father </s>
<s>  how he must have felt it </s>
<s> 

i never saw anyone so shocked </s>

minutes </s>

i do not know </s>

very difficult </s>
<s>  my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so

your attendance upon her has been too much for you </s>

<s>  you have had every care and anxiety

chapter 


the whole party were in hopes of a letter from <abvr> bennet the next
morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him </s>
<s> 
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent </s>
<s>  but at such a time they had hoped for exertion </s>
<s> 
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send </s>
<s>  but even of that they would have been glad to be certain </s>
<s>  <abvr>
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off </s>
<s> 

when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting
to prevail on <abvr> bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could
to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces </s>
<s>  she shared in their attendance on <abvr> bennet and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom </s>
<s>  their other aunt also
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of
cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them </s>
<s> 

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months
before had been almost an angel of light </s>
<s>  he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family </s>
<s> 
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world </s>
<s> 
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness </s>
<s>  elizabeth though she did not credit above
half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sisters ruin more certain </s>
<s>  and even jane who believed still less
of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come
when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely
despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner left longbourn on sunday </s>
<s>  on tuesday his wife received a
letter from him </s>
<s>  it told them that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street </s>
<s> 
that <abvr> bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival
but without gaining any satisfactory information </s>
<s>  and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as <abvr> bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first
coming to london before they procured lodgings </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it </s>
<s>  he added that <abvr>
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised
to write again very soon </s>
<s>  there was also a postscript to this effect </s>
<s> 

i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if
possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself </s>
<s>  if there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that it might be of essential consequence </s>
<s>  at present we have
nothing to guide us </s>
<s>  colonel forster will i dare say do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head </s>
<s>  but on second thoughts perhaps
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded </s>
<s>  but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved </s>
<s>  she had never
heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both
of whom had been dead many years </s>
<s>  it was possible however that some of
his companions in the shire might be able to give more information </s>
<s> 
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application
was a something to look forward to </s>
<s> 

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety </s>
<s>  but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected </s>
<s>  the arrival of letters
was the grand object of every mornings impatience </s>
<s>  through letters
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance </s>
<s> 

but before they heard again from <abvr> gardiner a letter arrived for
their father from a different quarter from <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  which as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence
she accordingly read </s>
<s>  and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise </s>
<s>  it was as
follows </s>
<s> 

my dear sir

i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation
in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
hertfordshire </s>
<s>  be assured my dear sir that <abvr> collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in
your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove </s>
<s>  no arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that
may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parents mind </s>
<s>  the death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this </s>
<s>  and it is the more to
be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte
informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence </s>
<s>  though at the same time
for the consolation of yourself and <abvr> bennet i am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity at so early an age </s>
<s>  howsoever that may be
you are grievously to be pitied </s>
<s>  in which opinion i am not only joined
by <abvr> collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to
whom i have related the affair </s>
<s>  they agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others </s>
<s>  for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says
will connect themselves with such a family </s>
<s>  and this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event
of last november </s>
<s>  for had it been otherwise i must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace </s>
<s>  let me then advise you dear sir to
console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense </s>
<s> 

i am dear sir etc </s>
<s>  etc </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
colonel forster </s>
<s>  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send </s>
<s> 
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one
living </s>
<s>  his former acquaintances had been numerous </s>
<s>  but since he
had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them </s>
<s>  there was no one therefore
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him </s>
<s>  and in the
wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount </s>
<s>  colonel forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton </s>
<s> 
he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more
formidable </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the longbourn family </s>
<s>  jane heard them with horror </s>
<s>  a gamester </s>
<s> 
 she cried </s>
<s>  this is wholly unexpected </s>
<s>  i had not an idea of it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day which was saturday </s>
<s>  rendered
spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded
to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit </s>
<s>  when <abvr> bennet was told of this she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before </s>
<s> 

what is he coming home and without poor lydia </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  sure he
will not leave london before he has found them </s>
<s>  who is to fight wickham
and make him marry her if he comes away </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she
and the children should go to london at the same time that <abvr> bennet
came from it </s>
<s>  the coach therefore took them the first stage of their
journey and brought its master back to longbourn </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world </s>
<s>  his
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece </s>
<s>  and
the kind of halfexpectation which <abvr> gardiner had formed of their
being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing </s>
<s>  elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from pemberley </s>
<s> 

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary </s>
<s>  nothing therefore could be
fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of
lydias infamy somewhat better </s>
<s>  it would have spared her she thought
one sleepless night out of two </s>
<s> 

when <abvr> bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure </s>
<s>  he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying </s>
<s>  made no mention of the business that had taken him
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it </s>
<s> 

it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject </s>
<s>  and then on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say
nothing of that </s>
<s>  who should suffer but myself </s>
<s>  it has been my own doing
and i ought to feel it </s>
<s> 

you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth </s>
<s> 

you may well warn me against such an evil </s>
<s>  human nature is so prone
to fall into it </s>
<s>  no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame </s>
<s>  i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression </s>
<s> 
it will pass away soon enough </s>
<s> 

do you suppose them to be in london </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  where else can they be so well concealed </s>
<s> 

and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty </s>
<s> 

she is happy then said her father drily </s>
<s>  and her residence there
will probably be of some duration </s>
<s> 

then after a short silence he continued </s>
<s> 

lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me
last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers
tea </s>
<s> 

this is a parade he cried which does one good </s>
<s>  it gives such an
elegance to misfortune </s>
<s>  another day i will do the same </s>
<s>  i will sit in my
library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as
i can </s>
<s>  or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away </s>
<s> 

i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully </s>
<s>  if i should
ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia </s>
<s> 

you go to brighton </s>
<s>  i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne
for fifty pounds </s>
<s>  no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and
you will feel the effects of it </s>
<s>  no officer is ever to enter into
my house again nor even to pass through the village </s>
<s>  balls will be
absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters </s>
<s> 
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner </s>
<s> 

kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry </s>
<s> 

well well said he do not make yourself unhappy </s>
<s>  if you are a good
girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of
them </s>

chapter 


two days after <abvr> bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother went forward to meet her </s>
<s>  but instead of the expected summons
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask </s>
<s> 

what do you mean hill </s>
<s>  we have heard nothing from town </s>
<s> 

dear madam cried <abvr> hill in great astonishment dont you know
there is an express come for master from <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  he has been here
this halfhour and master has had a letter </s>
<s> 

away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech </s>
<s>  they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom </s>
<s>  from thence to the
library </s>
<s>  their father was in neither </s>
<s>  and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the
butler who said </s>
<s> 

if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the
little copse </s>
<s> 

upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once
more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock </s>
<s> 

jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath
came up with him and eagerly cried out </s>
<s> 

oh papa what newswhat news </s>
<s>  have you heard from my uncle </s>
<s> 

yes i have had a letter from him by express </s>
<s> 

well and what news does it bringgood or bad </s>
<s> 

what is there of good to be expected </s>
<s>  said he taking the letter from
his pocket </s>
<s>  but perhaps you would like to read it </s>
<s> 

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand </s>
<s>  jane now came up </s>
<s> 

read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is
about </s>
<s> 

gracechurch street monday august  </s>
<s> 

my dear brother

at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as
upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction </s>
<s>  soon after you
left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
london they were </s>
<s>  the particulars i reserve till we meet </s>
<s>  it is enough
to know they are discovered </s>
<s>  i have seen them both

then it is as i always hoped cried jane </s>
<s>  they are married </s>
<s> 

elizabeth read on </s>
<s> 

i have seen them both </s>
<s>  they are not married nor can i find there
was any intention of being so </s>
<s>  but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will
not be long before they are </s>
<s>  all that is required of you is to assure
to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister </s>
<s>  and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her
during your life one hundred pounds per annum </s>
<s>  these are conditions
which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with
as far as i thought myself privileged for you </s>
<s>  i shall send this by
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer </s>
<s>  you
will easily comprehend from these particulars that <abvr> wickhams
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be </s>
<s> 
the world has been deceived in that respect </s>
<s>  and i am happy to say there
will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to
settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune </s>
<s>  if as i conclude
will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to
haggerston for preparing a proper settlement </s>
<s>  there will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again </s>
<s>  therefore stay quiet at
longbourn and depend on my diligence and care </s>
<s>  send back your answer as
fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly </s>
<s>  we have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope
you will approve </s>
<s>  she comes to us today </s>
<s>  i shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on </s>
<s>  yours etc </s>
<s> 

edw </s>
<s>  gardiner </s>
<s> 

is it possible </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth when she had finished </s>
<s>  can it be
possible that he will marry her </s>
<s> 

wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her
sister </s>
<s>  my dear father i congratulate you </s>
<s> 

and have you answered the letter </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  but it must be done soon </s>
<s> 

most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear father she cried come back and write immediately </s>
<s> 
consider how important every moment is in such a case </s>
<s> 

let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble
yourself </s>
<s> 

i dislike it very much he replied </s>
<s>  but it must be done </s>
<s> 

and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house </s>
<s> 

and may i ask said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but the terms i suppose must be
complied with </s>
<s> 

complied with </s>
<s>  i am only ashamed of his asking so little </s>
<s> 

and they must marry </s>
<s>  yet he is such a man </s>
<s> 

yes yes they must marry </s>
<s>  there is nothing else to be done </s>
<s>  but there
are two things that i want very much to know </s>
<s>  one is how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about </s>
<s>  and the other how am i ever
to pay him </s>
<s> 

money </s>
<s>  my uncle </s>
<s>  cried jane what do you mean sir </s>
<s> 

i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am
gone </s>
<s> 

that is very true said elizabeth </s>
<s>  though it had not occurred to me
before </s>
<s>  his debts to be discharged and something still to remain </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
it must be my uncles doings </s>
<s>  generous good man i am afraid he has
distressed himself </s>
<s>  a small sum could not do all this </s>
<s> 

no said her father </s>
<s>  wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds </s>
<s>  i should be sorry to think so ill of him
in the very beginning of our relationship </s>
<s> 

ten thousand pounds </s>
<s>  heaven forbid </s>
<s>  how is half such a sum to be
repaid </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued
silent till they reached the house </s>
<s>  their father then went on to the
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom </s>
<s> 

and they are really to be married </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth as soon as they
were by themselves </s>
<s>  how strange this is </s>
<s>  and for this we are to be
thankful </s>
<s>  that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice </s>
<s>  oh lydia </s>
<s> 

i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would
not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her </s>
<s>  though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced </s>
<s>  he has children
of his own and may have more </s>
<s>  how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds </s>
<s> 

if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall
exactly know what <abvr> gardiner has done for them because wickham has
not sixpence of his own </s>
<s>  the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited </s>
<s>  their taking her home and affording her their personal
protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge </s>
<s>  by this time she is
actually with them </s>
<s>  if such goodness does not make her miserable now
she will never deserve to be happy </s>
<s>  what a meeting for her when she
first sees my aunt </s>
<s> 

we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said
jane </s>
<s>  i hope and trust they will yet be happy </s>
<s>  his consenting to
marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of
thinking </s>
<s>  their mutual affection will steady them </s>
<s>  and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten </s>
<s> 

their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor
i nor anybody can ever forget </s>
<s>  it is useless to talk of it </s>
<s> 

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened </s>
<s>  they went to the library
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her </s>
<s>  he was writing and without raising his head coolly
replied </s>
<s> 

just as you please </s>
<s> 

may we take my uncles letter to read to her </s>
<s> 

take whatever you like and get away </s>
<s> 

elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs
together </s>
<s>  mary and kitty were both with <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  one communication
would therefore do for all </s>
<s>  after a slight preparation for good news
the letter was read aloud </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could hardly contain herself </s>
<s>  as
soon as jane had read <abvr> gardiners hope of lydias being soon
married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its
exuberance </s>
<s>  she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation </s>
<s>  to know that her daughter
would be married was enough </s>
<s>  she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct </s>
<s> 

my dear dear lydia </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  this is delightful indeed </s>
<s>  she will
be married </s>
<s>  i shall see her again </s>
<s>  she will be married at sixteen </s>
<s> 
my good kind brother </s>
<s>  i knew how it would be </s>
<s>  i knew he would manage
everything </s>
<s>  how i long to see her </s>
<s>  and to see dear wickham too </s>
<s>  but the
clothes the wedding clothes </s>
<s>  i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly </s>
<s>  lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him
how much he will give her </s>
<s>  stay stay i will go myself </s>
<s>  ring the bell
kitty for hill </s>
<s>  i will put on my things in a moment </s>
<s>  my dear dear
lydia </s>
<s>  how merry we shall be together when we meet </s>
<s> 

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which <abvr>
gardiners behaviour laid them all under </s>
<s> 

for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great
measure to his kindness </s>
<s>  we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist <abvr> wickham with money </s>
<s> 

well cried her mother it is all very right </s>
<s>  who should do it but
her own uncle </s>
<s>  if he had not had a family of his own i and my children
must have had all his money you know </s>
<s>  and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  i am so happy </s>
<s> 
in a short time i shall have a daughter married </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  how well
it sounds </s>
<s>  and she was only sixteen last june </s>
<s>  my dear jane i am in
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write </s>
<s>  so i will dictate and
you write for me </s>
<s>  we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards </s>
<s>  but the things should be ordered immediately </s>
<s> 

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had
not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted </s>
<s>  one days delay she observed
would be of small importance </s>
<s>  and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual </s>
<s>  other schemes too came into her head </s>
<s> 

i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the
good good news to my sister philips </s>
<s>  and as i come back i can call
on lady lucas and <abvr> long </s>
<s>  kitty run down and order the carriage </s>
<s> 
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure </s>
<s>  girls can i do
anything for you in meryton </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  here comes hill </s>
<s>  my dear hill have you
heard the good news </s>
<s>  miss lydia is going to be married </s>
<s>  and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hill began instantly to express her joy </s>
<s>  elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom </s>
<s> 

poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough </s>
<s>  but that it was
no worse she had need to be thankful </s>
<s>  she felt it so </s>
<s>  and though in
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had
feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived
him </s>
<s>  he now wished it more than ever </s>
<s>  had he done his duty in that
respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her </s>
<s>  the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place </s>
<s> 

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone

was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could </s>
<s> 

when first <abvr> bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly
useless for of course they were to have a son </s>
<s>  the son was to join
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for </s>
<s>  five daughters
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come </s>

bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he
would </s>
<s>  this event had at last been despaired of but it was then
too late to be saving </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet had no turn for economy and her
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income </s>
<s> 

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <abvr> bennet and
the children </s>
<s>  but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents </s>
<s>  this was one point with
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and <abvr> bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him </s>
<s>  in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother
though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him </s>
<s>  he had never before supposed
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement </s>
<s>  he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them </s>
<s>  for what with her board and pocket
allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within
that sum </s>
<s> 

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was
another very welcome surprise </s>
<s>  for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible </s>
<s>  when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he
naturally returned to all his former indolence </s>
<s>  his letter was soon
dispatched </s>
<s>  for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick
in its execution </s>
<s>  he begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her </s>
<s> 

the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy </s>
<s>  to be sure it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town </s>
<s>  or as the
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant
farmhouse </s>
<s>  but there was much to be talked of in marrying her </s>
<s>  and the
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain </s>
<s> 

it was a fortnight since <abvr> bennet had been downstairs </s>
<s>  but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in
spirits oppressively high </s>
<s>  no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph </s>
<s>  the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object
of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and
servants </s>
<s>  she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering
what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and
importance </s>
<s> 

haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor the
great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger </s>
<s>  but ashworth is
too far off </s>
<s>  i could not bear to have her ten miles from me </s>
<s>  and as for
pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful </s>
<s> 

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained </s>
<s>  but when they had withdrawn he said to her </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter let us come to a right understanding </s>
<s>  into one house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance </s>
<s>  i will not encourage the
impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn </s>
<s> 

a long dispute followed this declaration </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet was firm </s>
<s>  it
soon led to another </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet found with amazement and horror
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter </s>
<s>  he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could hardly comprehend
it </s>
<s>  that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe
possible </s>
<s>  she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of
the moment been led to make <abvr> darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister </s>
<s>  for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot </s>
<s> 

she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means </s>
<s>  there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended </s>
<s> 
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters
frailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate
there seemed a gulf impassable between them </s>
<s>  had lydias marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that
mr </s>
<s>  darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned </s>
<s> 

from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink </s>
<s>  the
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this </s>
<s>  she was humbled she was grieved </s>
<s>  she repented though she
hardly knew of what </s>
<s>  she became jealous of his esteem when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it </s>
<s>  she wanted to hear of him when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence </s>
<s>  she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they
should meet </s>
<s> 

what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received </s>
<s>  he was as generous she
doubted not as the most generous of his sex </s>
<s>  but while he was mortal
there must be a triumph </s>
<s> 

she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in
disposition and talents would most suit her </s>
<s>  his understanding and
temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes </s>
<s>  it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both </s>
<s>  by her ease
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved </s>
<s> 
and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she
must have received benefit of greater importance </s>
<s> 

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was </s>
<s>  an union of a different tendency and
precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their
family </s>
<s> 

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence
she could not imagine </s>
<s>  but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture </s>
<s> 

                              

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother </s>
<s>  to <abvr> bennets
acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family </s>
<s>  and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again </s>
<s>  the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that <abvr> wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia </s>
<s> 

it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as
his marriage was fixed on </s>
<s>  and i think you will agree with me in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on
his account and my nieces </s>
<s>  it is <abvr> wickhams intention to go into
the regulars </s>
<s>  and among his former friends there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army </s>
<s>  he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general ˜s regiment now quartered in the north </s>
<s>  it
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom </s>
<s>  he
promises fairly </s>
<s>  and i hope among different people where they may each
have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent </s>
<s>  i have
written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements

in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i
have pledged myself </s>

similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin
a list according to his information </s>
<s>  he has given in all his debts </s>
<s>  i
hope at least he has not deceived us </s>
<s>  haggerston has our directions
and all will be completed in a week </s>

you and her mother </s>

e </s>
<s>  gardiner </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal
from the shire as clearly as <abvr> gardiner could do </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet
was not so well pleased with it </s>
<s>  lydias being settled in the north
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire was a severe disappointment </s>
<s>  and besides it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody and had so many favourites </s>
<s> 

she is so fond of <abvr> forster said she it will be quite shocking
to send her away </s>
<s>  and there are several of the young men too that she
likes very much </s>
<s>  the officers may not be so pleasant in general ˜s
regiment </s>
<s> 

his daughters request for such it might be considered of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the north
received at first an absolute negative </s>
<s>  but jane and elizabeth
who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and
consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished </s>
<s>  and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
north </s>
<s>  when <abvr> bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent
his permission for them to come </s>
<s>  and it was settled that as soon as
the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn </s>
<s>  elizabeth was
surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and
had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes </s>

chapter 


their sisters wedding day arrived </s>
<s>  and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself </s>
<s>  the carriage was sent to
meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime </s>
<s>  their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she
been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure </s>
<s> 

they came </s>
<s>  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them </s>
<s>  smiles decked the face of <abvr> bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door </s>
<s>  her husband looked impenetrably grave </s>
<s>  her daughters alarmed
anxious uneasy </s>
<s> 

lydias voice was heard in the vestibule </s>
<s>  the door was thrown open and
she ran into the room </s>
<s>  her mother stepped forwards embraced her and
welcomed her with rapture </s>
<s>  gave her hand with an affectionate smile
to wickham who followed his lady </s>
<s>  and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness </s>
<s> 

their reception from <abvr> bennet to whom they then turned was not quite
so cordial </s>
<s>  his countenance rather gained in austerity </s>
<s>  and he scarcely
opened his lips </s>
<s>  the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was
enough to provoke him </s>
<s>  elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet
was shocked </s>
<s>  lydia was lydia still </s>
<s>  untamed unabashed wild noisy
and fearless </s>
<s>  she turned from sister to sister demanding their
congratulations </s>
<s>  and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and
observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been
there </s>
<s> 

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all </s>
<s>  elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance </s>
<s>  but she sat down
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man </s>
<s>  she blushed and jane blushed </s>
<s>  but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour </s>
<s> 

there was no want of discourse </s>
<s>  the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough </s>
<s>  and wickham who happened to sit near
elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies </s>
<s>  they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world </s>
<s>  nothing of the past was recollected with pain </s>
<s>  and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world </s>
<s> 

only think of its being three months she cried since i went away </s>
<s> 
it seems but a fortnight i declare </s>
<s>  and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time </s>
<s>  good gracious </s>
<s>  when i went away i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again </s>
<s>  though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was </s>
<s> 

her father lifted up his eyes </s>
<s>  jane was distressed </s>
<s>  elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia </s>
<s>  but she who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh </s>
<s>  mamma do the
people hereabouts know i am married today </s>
<s>  i was afraid they might not </s>
<s> 
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he
should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took
off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that
he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could bear it no longer </s>
<s>  she got up and ran out of the room </s>
<s> 
and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour </s>
<s>  she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say
to her eldest sister ah </s>
<s>  jane i take your place now and you must go
lower because i am a married woman </s>
<s> 

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first </s>
<s>  her ease and good
spirits increased </s>
<s>  she longed to see <abvr> phillips the lucases and
all their other neighbours and to hear herself called <abvr> wickham
 by each of them </s>
<s>  and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her
ring and boast of being married to <abvr> hill and the two housemaids </s>
<s> 

well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast
room and what do you think of my husband </s>
<s>  is not he a charming man </s>
<s>  i
am sure my sisters must all envy me </s>
<s>  i only hope they may have half
my good luck </s>
<s>  they must all go to brighton </s>
<s>  that is the place to get
husbands </s>
<s>  what a pity it is mamma we did not all go </s>
<s> 

very true </s>
<s>  and if i had my will we should </s>
<s>  but my dear lydia i dont
at all like your going such a way off </s>
<s>  must it be so </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> there is nothing in that </s>
<s>  i shall like it of all
things </s>
<s>  you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us </s>
<s>  we
shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some
balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all </s>
<s> 

i should like it beyond anything </s>
<s>  said her mother </s>
<s> 

and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you </s>
<s>  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over </s>
<s> 

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands </s>
<s> 

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham
had received his commission before he left london and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight </s>
<s> 

no one but <abvr> bennet regretted that their stay would be so short </s>
<s>  and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and
having very frequent parties at home </s>
<s>  these parties were acceptable to
all </s>
<s>  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not </s>
<s> 

wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected
to find it </s>
<s>  not equal to lydias for him </s>
<s>  she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his </s>
<s>  and she would have wondered why without violently caring
for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances </s>
<s>  and
if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion </s>
<s> 

lydia was exceedingly fond of him </s>
<s>  he was her dear wickham on every
occasion </s>
<s>  no one was to be put in competition with him </s>
<s>  he did every
thing best in the world </s>
<s>  and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september than any body else in the country </s>
<s> 

one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters she said to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe </s>
<s>  you
were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it </s>
<s>  are not you
curious to hear how it was managed </s>
<s> 

no really replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  you are so strange </s>
<s>  but i must tell you how it went off </s>
<s>  we were
married you know at st </s>
<s>  clements because wickhams lodgings were in
that parish </s>
<s>  and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
oclock </s>
<s>  my uncle and aunt and i were to go together </s>
<s>  and the others
were to meet us at the church </s>
<s>  well monday morning came and i was in
such a fuss </s>
<s>  i was so afraid you know that something would happen to
put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted </s>
<s>  and there was
my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon </s>
<s>  however i did not hear above one word in
ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham </s>
<s>  i longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat </s>
<s> 

well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual </s>
<s>  i thought it would never
be over </s>
<s>  for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them </s>
<s>  if youll believe
me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a
fortnight </s>
<s>  not one party or scheme or anything </s>
<s>  to be sure london was
rather thin but however the little theatre was open </s>
<s>  well and so
just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man <abvr> stone </s>
<s>  and then you know when once
they get together there is no end of it </s>
<s>  well i was so frightened i
did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away </s>
<s>  and if we
were beyond the hour we could not be married all day </s>
<s>  but luckily he
came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out </s>
<s>  however
i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the
wedding need not be put off for <abvr> darcy might have done as well </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  repeated elizabeth in utter amazement </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> he was to come there with wickham you know </s>
<s>  but gracious
me </s>
<s>  i quite forgot </s>
<s>  i ought not to have said a word about it </s>
<s>  i promised
them so faithfully </s>
<s>  what will wickham say </s>
<s>  it was to be such a secret </s>
<s> 

if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the
subject </s>
<s>  you may depend upon my seeking no further </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity </s>
<s>  we will
ask you no questions </s>
<s> 

thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you
all and then wickham would be angry </s>
<s> 

on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power by running away </s>
<s> 

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible </s>
<s>  or at least
it was impossible not to try for information </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy had been at
her sisters wedding </s>
<s>  it was exactly a scene and exactly among people
where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go </s>
<s> 
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her
brain </s>
<s>  but she was satisfied with none </s>
<s>  those that best pleased her as
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable </s>
<s>  she
could not bear such suspense </s>
<s>  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper
wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended </s>
<s> 

you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such
a time </s>
<s>  pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is
for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems
to think necessary </s>
<s>  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance </s>
<s> 

not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished
the letter </s>
<s>  and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out </s>
<s> 

janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall </s>
<s>  elizabeth was glad
of it </s>
<s> till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could </s>
<s>  she was no sooner in possession of it
than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to
be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy </s>
<s>  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial </s>

<s> 

my dear niece

i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise
what i have to tell you </s>
<s>  i must confess myself surprised by your
application </s>
<s>  i did not expect it from you </s>
<s>  dont think me angry
however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on your side </s>
<s>  if you do not choose to
understand me forgive my impertinence </s>
<s>  your uncle is as much surprised
as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done </s>
<s>  but if you are really
innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit </s>
<s> 

on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy called and was shut up with him several
hours </s>
<s>  it was all over before i arrived </s>
<s>  so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been </s>
<s>  he came to tell <abvr>
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and <abvr> wickham were
and that he had seen and talked with them both </s>
<s>  wickham repeatedly
lydia once </s>
<s>  from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day
after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them </s>
<s>  the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him </s>
<s>  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world </s>
<s>  his character was to speak for itself </s>
<s>  he
called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself </s>
<s>  if he had another
motive i am sure it would never disgrace him </s>
<s>  he had been some days
in town before he was able to discover them </s>
<s>  but he had something to
direct his search which was more than we had </s>
<s>  and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us </s>
<s> 

there is a lady it seems a <abvr> younge who was some time ago
governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation though he did not say what </s>
<s>  she then took a large
house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings </s>
<s>  this <abvr> younge was he knew intimately acquainted with
wickham </s>
<s>  and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town </s>
<s>  but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted </s>
<s>  she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and
corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found </s>
<s> 
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had
she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up
their abode with her </s>
<s>  at length however our kind friend procured the
wishedfor direction </s>
<s>  they were in  street </s>
<s>  he saw wickham and
afterwards insisted on seeing lydia </s>
<s>  his first object with her he
acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go </s>
<s>  but
he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was </s>
<s>  she cared
for none of her friends </s>
<s>  she wanted no help of his </s>
<s>  she would not hear
of leaving wickham </s>
<s>  she was sure they should be married some time or
other and it did not much signify when </s>
<s>  since such were her feelings
it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which
in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never
been his design </s>
<s>  he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment
on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing </s>
<s>  and
scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her
own folly alone </s>
<s>  he meant to resign his commission immediately </s>
<s>  and as
to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it </s>
<s>  he
must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have
nothing to live on </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once </s>
<s>  though
mr </s>
<s>  bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able
to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage </s>
<s>  but he found in reply to this question that wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country </s>
<s>  under such circumstances however he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief </s>
<s> 

they met several times for there was much to be discussed </s>
<s>  wickham of
course wanted more than he could get </s>
<s>  but at length was reduced to be
reasonable </s>
<s> 

every thing being settled between them <abvr> darcys next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch
street the evening before i came home </s>
<s>  but <abvr> gardiner could not be
seen and <abvr> darcy found on further inquiry that your father was
still with him but would quit town the next morning </s>
<s>  he did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former </s>
<s>  he did not leave his name and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business </s>
<s> 

on saturday he came again </s>
<s>  your father was gone your uncle at home
and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together </s>
<s> 

they met again on sunday and then i saw him too </s>
<s>  it was not all
settled before monday </s>
<s>  as soon as it was the express was sent off to
longbourn </s>
<s>  but our visitor was very obstinate </s>
<s>  i fancy lizzy that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all </s>
<s>  he has been
accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one </s>
<s> 
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself </s>
<s>  though i am sure and
i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole </s>
<s> 

they battled it together for a long time which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved </s>
<s>  but at last your uncle
was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it
which went sorely against the grain </s>
<s>  and i really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where
it was due </s>
<s>  but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane
at most </s>
<s> 

you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young
people </s>
<s>  his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably
more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon her and his commission purchased </s>
<s>  the reason why all
this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above </s>
<s>  it
was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that
wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was </s>
<s>  perhaps there was some truth
in this </s>
<s>  though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve
can be answerable for the event </s>
<s>  but in spite of all this fine talking
my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another
interest in the affair </s>
<s> 

when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who
were still staying at pemberley </s>
<s>  but it was agreed that he should be in
london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish </s>
<s> 

i believe i have now told you every thing </s>
<s>  it is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise </s>
<s>  i hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure </s>
<s>  lydia came to us </s>
<s>  and wickham had constant
admission to the house </s>
<s>  he was exactly what he had been when i
knew him in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  but i would not tell you how little i was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not
perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell
you can give you no fresh pain </s>
<s>  i talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family </s>
<s>  if she
heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen </s>
<s>  i was
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and
jane and for their sakes had patience with her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you
attended the wedding </s>
<s>  he dined with us the next day and was to leave
town again on wednesday or thursday </s>
<s>  will you be very angry with me my
dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
enough to say before how much i like him </s>
<s>  his behaviour to us has
in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire </s>
<s>  his
understanding and opinions all please me </s>
<s>  he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach
him </s>
<s>  i thought him very sly </s>
<s> he hardly ever mentioned your name </s>
<s>  but
slyness seems the fashion </s>
<s> 

pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from p </s>
<s>  i shall never be quite happy
till i have been all round the park </s>
<s>  a low phaeton with a nice little
pair of ponies would be the very thing </s>

but i must write no more </s>

hour </s>

yours very sincerely

<s> 

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share </s>
<s>  the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what <abvr> darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the
pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true </s>
<s> 
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research </s>
<s>  in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason
with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce </s>
<s>  he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem </s>
<s>  her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her </s>
<s>  but it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor
a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham </s>
<s>  brotherinlaw
of wickham </s>
<s>  every kind of pride must revolt from the connection </s>
<s>  he had
to be sure done much </s>
<s>  she was ashamed to think how much </s>
<s>  but he had
given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief </s>
<s>  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong </s>
<s>  he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it </s>
<s>  and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she
could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned </s>
<s>  it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return </s>
<s>  they
owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him </s>
<s>  for
herself she was humbled </s>
<s>  but she was proud of him </s>
<s>  proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself </s>
<s> 
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again </s>
<s>  it
was hardly enough </s>
<s>  but it pleased her </s>
<s>  she was even sensible of some
pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between <abvr> darcy and herself </s>
<s> 

she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones
approach </s>
<s>  and before she could strike into another path she was
overtaken by wickham </s>
<s> 

i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister </s>
<s>  said he
as he joined her </s>
<s> 

you certainly do she replied with a smile </s>
<s>  but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome </s>

<s>  <abvr> bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton </s>
<s>  and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that
you have actually seen pemberley </s>
<s> 

she replied in the affirmative </s>
<s> 

i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle </s>
<s>  and you saw the
old housekeeper i suppose </s>
<s>  poor reynolds she was always very fond of
me </s>

yes she did </s>
<s> 

and what did she say </s>

that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned
out well </s>
<s>  at such a distance as that you know things are strangely
misrepresented </s>
<s> 

certainly he replied biting his lips </s>
<s>  elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him </s>
<s>  but he soon afterwards said </s>
<s> 

i was surprised to see darcy in town last month </s>
<s>  we passed each other
several times </s>
<s>  i wonder what he can be doing there </s>
<s> 

perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said
elizabeth </s>
<s>  it must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  did you see him while you were at lambton </s>
<s>  i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had </s>
<s> 

yes </s>

<s> 

and do you like her </s>
<s> 

very much </s>

i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two </s>

you liked her </s>

i dare say she will </s>

did you go by the village of kympton </s>

i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had </s>
<s>  a
most delightful place </s>

me in every respect </s>

how should you have liked making sermons </s>

exceedingly well </s>

<s>  did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent </s>

i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was

you have </s>
<s>  yes there was something in that </s>
<s>  i told you so from the
first you may remember </s>
<s> 

i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present </s>

declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business
had been compromised accordingly </s>

you did </s>

what i told you on that point when first we talked of it </s>
<s> 

they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast
to get rid of him </s>

she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile </s>
<s> 

come <abvr> wickham we are brother and sister you know </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth
by introducing the subject of it </s>
<s>  and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet </s>
<s> 

the day of his and lydias departure soon came and <abvr> bennet was
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  i dont know </s>
<s>  not these two or three years perhaps </s>
<s> 

write to me very often my dear </s>
<s> 

as often as i can </s>
<s>  but you know married women have never much time for
writing </s>
<s>  my sisters may write to me </s>
<s>  they will have nothing else to
do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes </s>
<s>  he
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things </s>
<s> 

he is as fine a fellow said <abvr> bennet as soon as they were out of
the house as ever i saw </s>
<s>  he simpers and smirks and makes love to
us all </s>
<s>  i am prodigiously proud of him </s>
<s>  i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw </s>
<s> 

the loss of her daughter made <abvr> bennet very dull for several days </s>
<s> 

i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with
ones friends </s>
<s>  one seems so forlorn without them </s>
<s> 

this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said
elizabeth </s>
<s>  it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single </s>
<s> 

it is no such thing </s>
<s>  lydia does not leave me because she is married
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off </s>
<s>  if
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon </s>
<s> 

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation </s>
<s>  the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several
weeks </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was quite in the fidgets </s>
<s>  she looked at jane and
smiled and shook her head by turns </s>
<s> 

well well and so <abvr> bingley is coming down sister for <abvr>
phillips first brought her the news </s>
<s>  well so much the better </s>
<s>  not
that i care about it though </s>
<s>  he is nothing to us you know and i am
sure i never want to see him again </s>
<s>  but however he is very welcome
to come to netherfield if he likes it </s>
<s>  and who knows what may happen </s>
<s> 
but that is nothing to us </s>
<s>  you know sister we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it </s>
<s>  and so is it quite certain he is coming </s>
<s> 

you may depend on it replied the other for <abvr> nicholls was in
meryton last night </s>
<s>  i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it </s>
<s>  and she told me that it was certain true </s>
<s>  he
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday </s>
<s>  she was
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed </s>
<s> 

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour </s>
<s>  it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  but now as soon as they were alone together she said </s>
<s> 

i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present
report </s>
<s>  and i know i appeared distressed </s>
<s>  but dont imagine it was from
any silly cause </s>
<s>  i was only confused for the moment because i felt that
i should be looked at </s>
<s>  i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain </s>
<s>  i am glad of one thing that he comes
alone </s>
<s>  because we shall see the less of him </s>
<s>  not that i am afraid of
myself but i dread other peoples remarks </s>
<s> 

elizabeth did not know what to make of it </s>
<s>  had she not seen him in
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged </s>
<s>  but she still thought him partial
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come
without it </s>
<s> 

yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this
speculation </s>
<s>  i will leave him to himself </s>
<s> 

in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it </s>
<s>  they were more disturbed
more unequal than she had often seen them </s>
<s> 

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents
about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again </s>
<s> 

as soon as ever <abvr> bingley comes my dear said <abvr> bennet you
will wait on him of course </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i
went to see him he should marry one of my daughters </s>
<s>  but it ended in
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again </s>
<s> 

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to
netherfield </s>
<s> 

˜tis an etiquette i despise said he </s>
<s>  if he wants our society
let him seek it </s>
<s>  he knows where we live </s>
<s>  i will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again </s>
<s> 

well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him </s>
<s>  but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i
am determined </s>
<s>  we must have <abvr> long and the gouldings soon </s>
<s>  that will
make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for
him </s>
<s> 

consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her
husbands incivility </s>
<s>  though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see <abvr> bingley in consequence of it before
they did </s>
<s>  as the day of his arrival drew near

i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister </s>
<s>  it
would be nothing </s>
<s>  i could see him with perfect indifference but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of </s>
<s>  my mother means well </s>
<s> 
but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says </s>
<s>  happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over </s>
<s> 

i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but it
is wholly out of my power </s>
<s>  you must feel it </s>
<s>  and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have
always so much </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley arrived </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet through the assistance of servants
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could </s>
<s>  she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent </s>
<s> 
hopeless of seeing him before </s>
<s>  but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window
enter the paddock and ride towards the house </s>
<s> 

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy </s>
<s>  jane resolutely
kept her place at the table </s>
<s>  but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went
to the windowshe lookedshe saw <abvr> darcy with him and sat down
again by her sister </s>
<s> 

there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty </s>
<s>  who can it be </s>
<s> 

some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose </s>
<s>  i am sure i do not
know </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before </s>
<s>  <abvr> whatshisname </s>
<s>  that tall proud man </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> and so it does i vow </s>
<s>  well any friend of
mr </s>
<s>  bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure </s>
<s>  but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him </s>
<s> 

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern </s>
<s>  she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter </s>
<s>  both sisters were uncomfortable
enough </s>
<s>  each felt for the other and of course for themselves </s>
<s>  and their
mother talked on of her dislike of <abvr> darcy and her resolution to be
civil to him only as <abvr> bingleys friend without being heard by either
of them </s>
<s>  but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew <abvr>
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him </s>
<s> 
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused
and whose merit she had undervalued </s>
<s>  but to her own more extensive
information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as
what jane felt for bingley </s>
<s>  her astonishment at his comingat his
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire </s>
<s> 

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken </s>
<s>  but she would not be secure </s>
<s> 

let me first see how he behaves said she </s>
<s>  it will then be early
enough for expectation </s>
<s> 

she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door </s>
<s>  jane looked a little
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected </s>
<s>  on the
gentlemens appearing her colour increased </s>
<s>  yet she received them with
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance </s>
<s> 

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command </s>
<s>  she
had ventured only one glance at darcy </s>
<s>  he looked serious as usual </s>
<s>  and
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as
she had seen him at pemberley </s>
<s>  but perhaps he could not in her mothers
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  it was a painful but
not an improbable conjecture </s>
<s> 

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed </s>
<s>  he was received by <abvr>
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend </s>
<s> 

elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied </s>
<s> 

darcy after inquiring of her how <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner did a question
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything </s>
<s>  he
was not seated by her </s>
<s>  perhaps that was the reason of his silence </s>
<s>  but
it had not been so in derbyshire </s>
<s>  there he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself </s>
<s>  but now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice </s>
<s>  and when occasionally unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but
the ground </s>
<s>  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when
they last met were plainly expressed </s>
<s>  she was disappointed and angry
with herself for being so </s>
<s> 

could i expect it to be otherwise </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  yet why did he come </s>
<s> 

she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself </s>
<s>  and to
him she had hardly courage to speak </s>
<s> 

she inquired after his sister but could do no more </s>
<s> 

it is a long time <abvr> bingley since you went away said <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

he readily agreed to it </s>
<s> 

i began to be afraid you would never come back again </s>
<s>  people did say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas </s>
<s>  but however i hope
it is not true </s>
<s>  a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away </s>
<s>  miss lucas is married and settled </s>
<s>  and one of my
own daughters </s>
<s>  i suppose you have heard of it </s>
<s>  indeed you must have
seen it in the papers </s>
<s>  it was in the times and the courier i know </s>
<s> 
though it was not put in as it ought to be </s>
<s>  it was only said ˜lately
george wickham esq </s>
<s>  to miss lydia bennet without there being a
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything </s>
<s> 
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it </s>
<s>  did you see it </s>
<s> 

bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations </s>
<s>  elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes </s>
<s>  how <abvr> darcy looked therefore she could
not tell </s>
<s> 

it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married
 continued her mother but at the same time <abvr> bingley it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me </s>
<s>  they are gone down to
newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay
i do not know how long </s>
<s>  his regiment is there </s>
<s>  for i suppose you have
heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the
regulars </s>
<s>  thank heaven </s>
<s>  he has some friends though perhaps not so
many as he deserves </s>
<s> 

elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at <abvr> darcy was in such
misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat </s>
<s>  it drew from her
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually
done before </s>
<s>  and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present </s>
<s>  a few weeks he believed </s>
<s> 

when you have killed all your own birds <abvr> bingley said her mother
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on <abvr>
bennets manor </s>
<s>  i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and
will save all the best of the covies for you </s>
<s> 

elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious
attention </s>
<s>  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion </s>
<s>  at that instant she felt
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion </s>
<s> 

the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to
be in company with either of them </s>
<s>  their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this </s>
<s>  let me never see either
one or the other again </s>
<s> 

yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her
former lover </s>
<s>  when first he came in he had spoken to her but little </s>
<s> 
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention </s>
<s>  he
found her as handsome as she had been last year </s>
<s>  as good natured and
as unaffected though not quite so chatty </s>
<s>  jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever </s>
<s>  but her mind was so busily engaged
that she did not always know when she was silent </s>
<s> 

when the gentlemen rose to go away <abvr> bennet was mindful of her
intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time </s>
<s> 

you are quite a visit in my debt <abvr> bingley she added for when
you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned </s>
<s>  i have not forgot you see </s>
<s>  and i assure
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement </s>
<s> 

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business </s>
<s>  they then went away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day </s>
<s>  but though she always kept a very good table she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year </s>

chapter 


as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits </s>
<s> 
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her </s>
<s> 

why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she
did he come at all </s>
<s> 

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure </s>
<s> 

he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when
he was in town </s>
<s>  and why not to me </s>
<s>  if he fears me why come hither </s>
<s>  if
he no longer cares for me why silent </s>
<s>  teasing teasing man </s>
<s>  i will
think no more about him </s>
<s> 

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth </s>
<s> 

now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly
easy </s>
<s>  i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming </s>
<s>  i am glad he dines here on tuesday </s>
<s>  it will then be publicly
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly </s>
<s>  oh jane
take care </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now </s>
<s> 

i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever </s>
<s> 

                              

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet in
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good
humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had
revived </s>
<s> 

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn </s>
<s>  and the two
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen were in very good time </s>
<s>  when they repaired to the
diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by
her sister </s>
<s>  her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore
to invite him to sit by herself </s>
<s>  on entering the room he seemed to
hesitate </s>
<s>  but jane happened to look round and happened to smile </s>
<s>  it was
decided </s>
<s>  he placed himself by her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend </s>
<s> 
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards <abvr> darcy with an expression of halflaughing
alarm </s>
<s> 

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his
own would be speedily secured </s>
<s>  though she dared not depend upon the
consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour </s>
<s>  it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast </s>
<s>  for she was in
no cheerful humour </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them </s>
<s>  he was on one side of her mother </s>
<s>  she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to
advantage </s>
<s>  she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did </s>
<s>  her mothers ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind </s>
<s> 
and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family </s>
<s> 

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together </s>
<s>  that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance </s>
<s>  anxious
and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil </s>
<s>  she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend </s>
<s> 

if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for
ever </s>
<s> 

the gentlemen came </s>
<s>  and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  the ladies had crowded round the table
where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair </s>
<s>  and on the gentlemens approaching one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper </s>
<s> 

the men shant come and part us i am determined </s>
<s>  we want none of them </s>
<s> 
do we </s>
<s> 

darcy had walked away to another part of the room </s>
<s>  she followed him with
her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee </s>
<s>  and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly </s>
<s> 

a man who has once been refused </s>
<s>  how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love </s>
<s>  is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman </s>
<s> 
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings </s>
<s> 

she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself </s>
<s>  and she seized the opportunity of saying </s>
<s> 

is your sister at pemberley still </s>
<s> 

yes she will remain there till christmas </s>
<s> 

and quite alone </s>
<s>  have all her friends left her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  annesley is with her </s>
<s>  the others have been gone on to scarborough
these three weeks </s>
<s> 

she could think of nothing more to say </s>
<s>  but if he wished to converse
with her he might have better success </s>
<s>  he stood by her however for
some minutes in silence </s>
<s>  and at last on the young ladys whispering
to elizabeth again he walked away </s>
<s> 

when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies
all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party </s>
<s>  she now lost every expectation of pleasure </s>
<s> 
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper </s>
<s>  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others and she had no opportunity of detaining them </s>
<s> 

well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what
say you to the day </s>
<s>  i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well
i assure you </s>
<s>  the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw </s>
<s>  the
venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch </s>
<s>  the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases last week </s>
<s>  and even <abvr> darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done </s>
<s>  and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least </s>
<s>  and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater
beauty </s>
<s>  <abvr> long said so too for i asked her whether you did not </s>
<s>  and
what do you think she said besides </s>
<s>  ˜ah </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet we shall have her
at netherfield at last </s>
<s>  she did indeed </s>
<s>  i do think <abvr> long is as good
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls
and not at all handsome </s>
<s>  i like them prodigiously </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet in short was in very great spirits </s>
<s>  she had seen enough of
bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last </s>
<s>  and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals </s>
<s> 

it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth </s>
<s>  the
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other </s>
<s>  i hope we
may often meet again </s>
<s> 

elizabeth smiled </s>
<s> 

lizzy you must not do so </s>
<s>  you must not suspect me </s>
<s>  it mortifies me </s>
<s> 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it </s>
<s>  i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had
any design of engaging my affection </s>
<s>  it is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man </s>
<s> 

you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and
are provoking me to it every moment </s>
<s> 

how hard it is in some cases to be believed </s>
<s> 

and how impossible in others </s>
<s> 

but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge </s>
<s> 

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer </s>
<s>  we all love to
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing </s>
<s>  forgive
me </s>
<s>  and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante </s>
<s> 



chapter 


a few days after this visit <abvr> bingley called again and alone </s>
<s>  his
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in
ten days time </s>
<s>  he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably
good spirits </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet invited him to dine with them </s>
<s>  but with many
expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere </s>
<s> 

next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky </s>
<s> 

he should be particularly happy at any time etc </s>
<s>  etc </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and if she would
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them </s>
<s> 

can you come tomorrow </s>
<s> 

yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow </s>
<s>  and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity </s>
<s> 

he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed </s>
<s>  in ran <abvr> bennet to her daughters room in her dressing
gown and with her hair half finished crying out </s>
<s> 

my dear jane make haste and hurry down </s>
<s>  he is comemr </s>
<s>  bingley is
come </s>
<s>  he is indeed </s>
<s>  make haste make haste </s>
<s>  here sarah come to miss
bennet this moment and help her on with her gown </s>
<s>  never mind miss
lizzys hair </s>
<s> 

we will be down as soon as we can said jane </s>
<s>  but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  hang kitty </s>
<s>  what has she to do with it </s>
<s>  come be quick be quick </s>
<s> 
where is your sash my dear </s>
<s> 

but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters </s>
<s> 

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening </s>
<s>  after tea <abvr> bennet retired to the library as was his
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument </s>
<s>  two obstacles of
the five being thus removed <abvr> bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any
impression on them </s>
<s>  elizabeth would not observe her </s>
<s>  and when at last
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma </s>
<s>  what do
you keep winking at me for </s>
<s>  what am i to do </s>
<s> 

nothing child nothing </s>
<s>  i did not wink at you </s>
<s>  she then sat still
five minutes longer </s>
<s>  but unable to waste such a precious occasion she
suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to
speak to you took her out of the room </s>
<s>  jane instantly gave a look
at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her
entreaty that she would not give in to it </s>
<s>  in a few minutes <abvr>
bennet halfopened the door and called out </s>
<s> 

lizzy my dear i want to speak with you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was forced to go </s>
<s> 

we may as well leave them by themselves you know </s>
<s>  said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall </s>
<s>  kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in
my dressingroom </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned
into the drawingroom </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual </s>
<s>  bingley was every
thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter </s>
<s>  his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party </s>
<s>  and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter </s>
<s> 

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper </s>
<s>  and before he went
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and <abvr>
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband </s>
<s> 

after this day jane said no more of her indifference </s>
<s>  not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley </s>
<s>  but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless <abvr> darcy
returned within the stated time </s>
<s>  seriously however she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans
concurrence </s>
<s> 

bingley was punctual to his appointment </s>
<s>  and he and <abvr> bennet spent
the morning together as had been agreed on </s>
<s>  the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected </s>
<s>  there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into
silence </s>
<s>  and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him </s>
<s>  bingley of course returned with him to dinner </s>
<s> 
and in the evening <abvr> bennets invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter </s>
<s>  elizabeth who had a letter
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea </s>
<s> 
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes </s>
<s> 

but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her </s>
<s>  on opening the door she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in
earnest conversation </s>
<s>  and had this led to no suspicion the faces of
both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would
have told it all </s>
<s>  their situation was awkward enough </s>
<s>  but hers she
thought was still worse </s>
<s>  not a syllable was uttered by either </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few
words to her sister ran out of the room </s>
<s> 

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give
pleasure </s>
<s>  and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world </s>
<s> 

˜tis too much </s>
<s>  she added by far too much </s>
<s>  i do not deserve it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
why is not everybody as happy </s>
<s> 

elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth
a delight which words could but poorly express </s>
<s>  every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane </s>
<s>  but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be
said for the present </s>
<s> 

i must go instantly to my mother </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude </s>
<s>  or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself </s>
<s>  he is gone to my father already </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  lizzy to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family </s>
<s>  how shall i bear so much happiness </s>
<s> 

she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the
card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty </s>
<s> 

elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation </s>
<s> 

and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious
circumspection </s>
<s>  of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance </s>
<s>  the
happiest wisest most reasonable end </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose </s>
<s> 

where is your sister </s>
<s>  said he hastily as he opened the door </s>
<s> 

with my mother up stairs </s>
<s>  she will be down in a moment i dare say </s>
<s> 

he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister </s>
<s>  elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship </s>
<s>  they shook hands with
great cordiality </s>
<s>  and then till her sister came down she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections </s>
<s> 
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself </s>
<s> 

it was an evening of no common delight to them all </s>
<s>  the satisfaction of
miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as
made her look handsomer than ever </s>
<s>  kitty simpered and smiled and hoped
her turn was coming soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour </s>
<s>  and when
mr </s>
<s>  bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was </s>
<s> 

not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their
visitor took his leave for the night </s>
<s>  but as soon as he was gone he
turned to his daughter and said </s>
<s> 

jane i congratulate you </s>
<s>  you will be a very happy woman </s>
<s> 

jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his
goodness </s>
<s> 

you are a good girl </s>
<s>  he replied and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled </s>
<s>  i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together </s>
<s>  your tempers are by no means unlike </s>
<s>  you are
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on </s>
<s>  so
easy that every servant will cheat you </s>
<s>  and so generous that you will
always exceed your income </s>
<s> 

i hope not so </s>
<s>  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me </s>
<s> 

exceed their income </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> bennet cried his wife what are you
talking of </s>
<s>  why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely
more </s>
<s>  then addressing her daughter oh </s>
<s>  my dear dear jane i am so
happy </s>
<s>  i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night </s>
<s>  i knew how it
would be </s>
<s>  i always said it must be so at last </s>
<s>  i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing </s>
<s>  i remember as soon as ever i saw him when
he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was
that you should come together </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen </s>
<s> 

wickham lydia were all forgotten </s>
<s>  jane was beyond competition her
favourite child </s>
<s>  at that moment she cared for no other </s>
<s>  her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense </s>
<s> 

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield </s>
<s>  and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter </s>
<s> 

bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn </s>
<s> 
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after
supper </s>
<s>  unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough
detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister </s>
<s>  for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else </s>
<s> 
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur </s>
<s>  in the absence of jane he
always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of
her </s>
<s>  and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of
relief </s>
<s> 

he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring </s>
<s>  i had not believed
it possible </s>
<s> 

i suspected as much replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but how did he account for
it </s>
<s> 

it must have been his sisters doing </s>
<s>  they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects </s>
<s>  but when they see
as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again </s>
<s>  though we
can never be what we once were to each other </s>
<s> 

that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever
heard you utter </s>
<s>  good girl </s>
<s>  it would vex me indeed to see you again
the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard </s>
<s> 

would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again </s>
<s> 

he made a little mistake to be sure </s>
<s>  but it is to the credit of his
modesty </s>
<s> 

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and
the little value he put on his own good qualities </s>
<s>  elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend </s>
<s>  for
though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him </s>
<s> 

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed </s>
<s>  cried
jane </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed
above them all </s>
<s>  if i could but see you as happy </s>
<s>  if there were but
such another man for you </s>
<s> 

if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as
you </s>
<s>  till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your
happiness </s>
<s>  no no let me shift for myself </s>
<s>  and perhaps if i have very
good luck i may meet with another <abvr> collins in time </s>
<s> 

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was privileged to whisper it to <abvr> phillips
and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton </s>
<s> 

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune </s>
<s> 



chapter 


one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been
formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage </s>
<s>  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn </s>
<s>  it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours </s>
<s>  the horses
were post </s>
<s>  and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it were familiar to them </s>
<s>  as it was certain however that
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the
shrubbery </s>
<s>  they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered </s>
<s>  it was lady catherine de bourgh </s>
<s> 

they were of course all intending to be surprised </s>
<s>  but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation </s>
<s>  and on the part of <abvr>
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even
inferior to what elizabeth felt </s>
<s> 

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no
other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the
head and sat down without saying a word </s>
<s>  elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of
introduction had been made </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance received her with the utmost politeness </s>
<s>  after sitting
for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth

i hope you are well miss bennet </s>
<s>  that lady i suppose is your
mother </s>
<s> 

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was </s>
<s> 

and that i suppose is one of your sisters </s>
<s> 

yes madam said <abvr> bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine </s>
<s> 
she is my youngest girl but one </s>
<s>  my youngest of all is lately married
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man
who i believe will soon become a part of the family </s>
<s> 

you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short
silence </s>
<s> 

it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say </s>
<s>  but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass </s>
<s> 

this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in
summer </s>
<s>  the windows are full west </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then
added </s>
<s> 

may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  collins well </s>
<s> 

yes very well </s>
<s>  i saw them the night before last </s>
<s> 

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling </s>
<s>  but no
letter appeared and she was completely puzzled </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment </s>
<s>  but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely
declined eating anything </s>
<s>  and then rising up said to elizabeth

miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn </s>
<s>  i should be glad to take a turn in it if you
will favour me with your company </s>
<s> 

go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the
different walks </s>
<s>  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage </s>
<s> 

elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol
attended her noble guest downstairs </s>
<s>  as they passed through the
hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and
drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent
looking rooms walked on </s>
<s> 

her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her
waitingwoman was in it </s>
<s>  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse </s>
<s>  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

how could i ever think her like her nephew </s>
<s>  said she as she looked in
her face </s>
<s> 

as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following
manner </s>
<s> 

you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my
journey hither </s>
<s>  your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i
come </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment </s>
<s> 

indeed you are mistaken madam </s>
<s>  i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here </s>
<s> 

miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with </s>
<s>  but however insincere you may
choose to be you shall not find me so </s>
<s>  my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it </s>
<s>  a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago </s>
<s>  i was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  though i
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved
on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to
you </s>
<s> 

if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far </s>
<s>  what could your ladyship propose by it </s>
<s> 

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted </s>
<s> 

your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it </s>
<s>  if indeed such a report
is in existence </s>
<s> 

if </s>
<s>  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it </s>
<s>  has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves </s>
<s>  do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad </s>
<s> 

i never heard that it was </s>
<s> 

and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it </s>
<s> 

i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship </s>
<s>  you may
ask questions which i shall not choose to answer </s>
<s> 

this is not to be borne </s>
<s>  miss bennet i insist on being satisfied </s>
<s>  has
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage </s>
<s> 

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible </s>
<s> 

it ought to be so </s>
<s>  it must be so while he retains the use of his
reason </s>
<s>  but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family </s>
<s>  you
may have drawn him in </s>
<s> 

if i have i shall be the last person to confess it </s>
<s> 

miss bennet do you know who i am </s>
<s>  i have not been accustomed to such
language as this </s>
<s>  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns </s>
<s> 

but you are not entitled to know mine </s>
<s>  nor will such behaviour as this
ever induce me to be explicit </s>
<s> 

let me be rightly understood </s>
<s>  this match to which you have the
presumption to aspire can never take place </s>
<s>  no never </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is
engaged to my daughter </s>
<s>  now what have you to say </s>
<s> 

only this </s>
<s>  that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me </s>
<s> 

lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied </s>
<s> 

the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind </s>
<s>  from their infancy
they have been intended for each other </s>
<s>  it was the favourite wish of
his mother as well as of hers </s>
<s>  while in their cradles we planned
the union </s>
<s>  and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to
the family </s>
<s>  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends </s>
<s>  to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy </s>
<s>  have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin </s>
<s> 

yes and i had heard it before </s>
<s>  but what is that to me </s>
<s>  if there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage </s>
<s>  its completion depended on others </s>
<s>  if <abvr> darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make
another choice </s>
<s>  and if i am that choice why may not i accept him </s>
<s> 

because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it </s>
<s>  yes
miss bennet interest </s>
<s>  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all </s>
<s>  you will
be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him </s>
<s> 
your alliance will be a disgrace </s>
<s>  your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us </s>
<s> 

these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but the wife of <abvr>
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause
to repine </s>
<s> 

obstinate headstrong girl </s>
<s>  i am ashamed of you </s>
<s>  is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring </s>
<s>  is nothing due to me on that
score </s>
<s>  let us sit down </s>
<s>  you are to understand miss bennet that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose </s>
<s>  nor will
i be dissuaded from it </s>
<s>  i have not been used to submit to any persons
whims </s>
<s>  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment </s>
<s> 

that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable </s>
<s> 
but it will have no effect on me </s>
<s> 

i will not be interrupted </s>
<s>  hear me in silence </s>
<s>  my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other </s>
<s>  they are descended on the maternal
side from the same noble line </s>
<s>  and on the fathers from respectable
honourable and ancientthough untitledfamilies </s>
<s>  their fortune on
both sides is splendid </s>
<s>  they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses </s>
<s>  and what is to divide them </s>
<s> 
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections
or fortune </s>
<s>  is this to be endured </s>
<s>  but it must not shall not be </s>
<s>  if you
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up </s>
<s> 

in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere </s>
<s>  he is a gentleman </s>
<s>  i am a gentlemans daughter </s>
<s>  so far we are
equal </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s>  you are a gentlemans daughter </s>
<s>  but who was your mother </s>
<s> 
who are your uncles and aunts </s>
<s>  do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition </s>
<s> 

whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does
not object to them they can be nothing to you </s>
<s> 

tell me once for all are you engaged to him </s>
<s> 

though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a
moments deliberation </s>
<s> 

i am not </s>
<s> 

lady catherine seemed pleased </s>
<s> 

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement </s>
<s> 

i will make no promise of the kind </s>
<s> 

miss bennet i am shocked and astonished </s>
<s>  i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman </s>
<s>  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that
i will ever recede </s>
<s>  i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require </s>
<s> 

and i certainly never shall give it </s>
<s>  i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable </s>
<s>  your ladyship wants <abvr> darcy to marry
your daughter </s>
<s>  but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their
marriage at all more probable </s>
<s>  supposing him to be attached to me would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin </s>
<s> 
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was illjudged </s>
<s>  you have widely mistaken my character if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these </s>
<s>  how far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell </s>
<s> 
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine </s>
<s>  i must beg
therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject </s>
<s> 

not so hasty if you please </s>
<s>  i have by no means done </s>
<s>  to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add </s>
<s>  i am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous
elopement </s>
<s>  i know it all </s>
<s>  that the young mans marrying her was a
patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles </s>
<s>  and is
such a girl to be my nephews sister </s>
<s>  is her husband is the son of his
late fathers steward to be his brother </s>
<s>  heaven and earth </s>
<s> of what are
you thinking </s>
<s>  are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted </s>
<s> 

you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered </s>
<s> 
you have insulted me in every possible method </s>
<s>  i must beg to return to
the house </s>
<s> 

and she rose as she spoke </s>
<s>  lady catherine rose also and they turned
back </s>
<s>  her ladyship was highly incensed </s>
<s> 

you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew </s>
<s> 
unfeeling selfish girl </s>
<s>  do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody </s>
<s> 

lady catherine i have nothing further to say </s>
<s>  you know my sentiments </s>
<s> 

you are then resolved to have him </s>
<s> 

i have said no such thing </s>
<s>  i am only resolved to act in that manner
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without
reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me </s>
<s> 

it is well </s>
<s>  you refuse then to oblige me </s>
<s>  you refuse to obey the
claims of duty honour and gratitude </s>
<s>  you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world </s>
<s> 

neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any
possible claim on me in the present instance </s>
<s>  no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  and with regard to the
resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former
were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments
concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn </s>
<s> 

and this is your real opinion </s>
<s>  this is your final resolve </s>
<s>  very well </s>
<s> 
i shall now know how to act </s>
<s>  do not imagine miss bennet that your
ambition will ever be gratified </s>
<s>  i came to try you </s>
<s>  i hoped to find you
reasonable </s>
<s>  but depend upon it i will carry my point </s>
<s> 

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave
of you miss bennet </s>
<s>  i send no compliments to your mother </s>
<s>  you deserve
no such attention </s>
<s>  i am most seriously displeased </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no answer </s>
<s>  and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself </s>
<s>  she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs </s>
<s>  her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself </s>
<s> 

she did not choose it said her daughter she would go </s>
<s> 

she is a very finelooking woman </s>
<s>  and her calling here was prodigiously
civil </s>
<s>  for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were
well </s>
<s>  she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through
meryton thought she might as well call on you </s>
<s>  i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you lizzy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here </s>
<s>  for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome </s>
<s>  nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly </s>
<s>  lady catherine it
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <abvr>
darcy </s>
<s>  it was a rational scheme to be sure </s>
<s>  but from what the report
of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine </s>
<s> 
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply
the idea </s>
<s>  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together </s>
<s>  and her neighbours
at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time </s>
<s> 

in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference </s>
<s>  from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew </s>
<s>  and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce </s>
<s>  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do </s>
<s>  and it
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would
address him on his weakest side </s>
<s>  with his notions of dignity he would
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning </s>
<s> 

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often
seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him </s>
<s>  in that case he would return no more </s>
<s>  lady
catherine might see him in her way through town </s>
<s>  and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way </s>
<s> 

if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand
it </s>
<s>  i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his
constancy </s>
<s>  if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him
at all </s>
<s> 

                              

the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had
been was very great </s>
<s>  but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased <abvr> bennets curiosity </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject </s>
<s> 

the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her
father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand </s>
<s> 

lizzy said he i was going to look for you </s>
<s>  come into my room </s>
<s> 

she followed him thither </s>
<s>  and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held </s>
<s>  it suddenly struck her that it
might be from lady catherine </s>
<s>  and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations </s>
<s> 

she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down </s>
<s>  he
then said

i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly </s>
<s>  as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its
contents </s>
<s>  i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony </s>
<s>  let me congratulate you on a very important conquest </s>
<s> 

the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt </s>
<s> 
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself </s>
<s>  when her father continued </s>
<s> 

you look conscious </s>
<s>  young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these </s>
<s>  but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer </s>
<s>  this letter is from <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 

from <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  and what can he have to say </s>
<s> 

something very much to the purpose of course </s>
<s>  he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of
which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping
lucases </s>
<s>  i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point </s>
<s>  what relates to yourself is as follows </s>
<s>  ˜having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of <abvr> collins and myself on
this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another </s>
<s> 
of which we have been advertised by the same authority </s>
<s>  your daughter
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land </s>
<s> 

can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this </s>
<s>  ˜this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive
patronage </s>
<s>  yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin
elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of </s>
<s> 

have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is </s>
<s>  but now it comes out </s>
<s> 

˜my motive for cautioning you is as follows </s>
<s>  we have reason to imagine
that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with
a friendly eye </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy you see is the man </s>
<s>  now lizzy i think i have
surprised you </s>
<s>  could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his
life </s>
<s>  it is admirable </s>
<s> 

elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force
one most reluctant smile </s>
<s>  never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her </s>
<s> 

are you not diverted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  pray read on </s>
<s> 

˜after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she
felt on the occasion </s>
<s>  when it became apparent that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match </s>
<s>  i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins moreover adds ˜i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad
business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known </s>
<s>  i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married </s>
<s>  it was an
encouragement of vice </s>
<s>  and had i been the rector of longbourn i should
very strenuously have opposed it </s>
<s>  you ought certainly to forgive them
as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing </s>
<s>  that is his notion of christian
forgiveness </s>
<s>  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes
situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch </s>
<s>  but lizzy you
look as if you did not enjoy it </s>
<s>  you are not going to be missish
i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report </s>
<s>  for what do we
live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our
turn </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted </s>
<s>  but it is so
strange </s>
<s> 

yesthat is what makes it amusing </s>
<s>  had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing </s>
<s>  but his perfect indifference and your
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd </s>
<s>  much as i abominate
writing i would not give up <abvr> collinss correspondence for any
consideration </s>
<s>  nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my soninlaw </s>
<s>  and pray lizzy what said lady catherine
about this report </s>
<s>  did she call to refuse her consent </s>
<s> 

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh </s>
<s>  and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by
his repeating it </s>
<s>  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not </s>
<s>  it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried </s>
<s>  her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of <abvr> darcys indifference and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of
his seeing too little she might have fancied too much </s>
<s> 



chapter 


instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as
elizabeth half expected <abvr> bingley to do he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines
visit </s>
<s>  the gentlemen arrived early </s>
<s>  and before <abvr> bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed
their all walking out </s>
<s>  it was agreed to </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was not in the
habit of walking </s>
<s>  mary could never spare time </s>
<s>  but the remaining five
set off together </s>
<s>  bingley and jane however soon allowed the others
to outstrip them </s>
<s>  they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy
were to entertain each other </s>
<s>  very little was said by either </s>
<s>  kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk </s>
<s>  elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution </s>
<s>  and perhaps he might be doing the same </s>
<s> 

they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon
maria </s>
<s>  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone </s>
<s>  now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was
high she immediately said </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy i am a very selfish creature </s>
<s>  and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours </s>
<s>  i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister </s>
<s>  ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it </s>
<s>  were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express </s>
<s> 

i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a
mistaken light have given you uneasiness </s>
<s>  i did not think <abvr> gardiner
was so little to be trusted </s>
<s> 

you must not blame my aunt </s>
<s>  lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter </s>
<s>  and of course i could
not rest till i knew the particulars </s>
<s>  let me thank you again and again
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the
sake of discovering them </s>
<s> 

if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone </s>
<s> 
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny </s>
<s>  but your
family owe me nothing </s>
<s>  much as i respect them i believe i thought
only of you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word </s>
<s>  after a short pause
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me </s>
<s>  if your
feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once </s>
<s>  my
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation now forced herself to speak </s>
<s>  and immediately though not
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances </s>
<s>  the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before </s>
<s>  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do </s>
<s>  had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him </s>
<s> 
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his
affection every moment more valuable </s>
<s> 

they walked on without knowing in what direction </s>
<s>  there was too much to
be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects </s>
<s>  she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth </s>
<s>  dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance </s>
<s>  in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give </s>
<s>  but unluckily for her
ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise </s>
<s> 

it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before </s>
<s>  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly </s>
<s> 

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of that </s>
<s>  after abusing you so
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations </s>
<s> 

what did you say of me that i did not deserve </s>
<s>  for though your
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof </s>
<s>  it was
unpardonable </s>
<s>  i cannot think of it without abhorrence </s>
<s> 

we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening said elizabeth </s>
<s>  the conduct of neither if strictly examined
will be irreproachable </s>
<s>  but since then we have both i hope improved
in civility </s>
<s> 

i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself </s>
<s>  the recollection of what i
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me </s>
<s>  your
reproof so well applied i shall never forget </s>
<s>  ˜had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner </s>
<s>  those were your words </s>
<s>  you know not you can
scarcely conceive how they have tortured me </s>
<s> though it was some time
i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice </s>
<s> 

i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression </s>
<s>  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way </s>
<s> 

i can easily believe it </s>
<s>  you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling i am sure you did </s>
<s>  the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  do not repeat what i then said </s>
<s>  these recollections will not do at
all </s>
<s>  i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it </s>
<s> 

darcy mentioned his letter </s>
<s>  did it said he did it soon make you
think better of me </s>
<s>  did you on reading it give any credit to its
contents </s>
<s> 

she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed </s>
<s> 

i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was
necessary </s>
<s>  i hope you have destroyed the letter </s>
<s>  there was one part
especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the
power of reading again </s>
<s>  i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me </s>
<s> 

the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard </s>
<s>  but though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily
changed as that implies </s>
<s> 

when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit </s>
<s> 

the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so </s>
<s>  the
adieu is charity itself </s>
<s>  but think no more of the letter </s>
<s>  the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now
so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten </s>
<s>  you must learn some
of my philosophy </s>
<s>  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure </s>
<s> 

i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind </s>
<s>  your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of
innocence </s>
<s>  but with me it is not so </s>
<s>  painful recollections will intrude
which cannot which ought not to be repelled </s>
<s>  i have been a selfish
being all my life in practice though not in principle </s>
<s>  as a child i
was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper </s>
<s>  i
was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit </s>
<s> 
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt
by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all
that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing </s>
<s>  to care for none beyond my own family
circle </s>
<s>  to think meanly of all the rest of the world </s>
<s>  to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own </s>
<s>  such i
was from eight to eight and twenty </s>
<s>  and such i might still have been
but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth </s>
<s>  what do i not owe you </s>
<s>  you
taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous </s>
<s>  by you
i was properly humbled </s>
<s>  i came to you without a doubt of my reception </s>
<s> 
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased </s>
<s> 

had you then persuaded yourself that i should </s>
<s> 

indeed i had </s>
<s>  what will you think of my vanity </s>
<s>  i believed you to be
wishing expecting my addresses </s>
<s> 

my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure
you </s>
<s>  i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me
wrong </s>
<s>  how you must have hated me after that evening </s>
<s> 

hate you </s>
<s>  i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction </s>
<s> 

i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
pemberley </s>
<s>  you blamed me for coming </s>
<s> 

no indeed </s>
<s>  i felt nothing but surprise </s>
<s> 

your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you </s>
<s> 
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due </s>
<s> 

my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in
my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past </s>
<s>  and i hoped to
obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to </s>
<s>  how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you </s>
<s> 

he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption </s>
<s>  which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend </s>
<s> 

she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther </s>
<s> 

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know
anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that
it was time to be at home </s>
<s> 

what could become of <abvr> bingley and jane </s>
<s>  was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs </s>
<s>  darcy was delighted with
their engagement </s>
<s>  his friend had given him the earliest information of
it </s>
<s> 

i must ask whether you were surprised </s>
<s>  said elizabeth </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>  when i went away i felt that it would soon happen </s>
<s> 

that is to say you had given your permission </s>
<s>  i guessed as much </s>
<s>  and
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much
the case </s>
<s> 

on the evening before my going to london said he i made a
confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago </s>
<s>  i
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent </s>
<s>  his surprise was great </s>
<s>  he had never had
the slightest suspicion </s>
<s>  i told him moreover that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent
to him </s>
<s>  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend </s>
<s> 

did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring </s>
<s> 

from the former </s>
<s>  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made here </s>
<s>  and i was convinced of her affection </s>
<s> 

and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to
him </s>
<s> 

it did </s>
<s>  bingley is most unaffectedly modest </s>
<s>  his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy </s>
<s>  i was obliged to confess
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him </s>
<s>  i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him </s>
<s>  he was
angry </s>
<s>  but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sisters sentiments </s>
<s>  he has heartily forgiven me
now </s>
<s> 

elizabeth longed to observe that <abvr> bingley had been a most delightful
friend </s>
<s>  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable </s>
<s>  but she checked
herself </s>
<s>  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at
and it was rather too early to begin </s>
<s>  in anticipating the happiness
of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he
continued the conversation till they reached the house </s>
<s>  in the hall they
parted </s>

chapter 


my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to </s>
<s>  was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room
and from all the others when they sat down to table </s>
<s>  she had only to
say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge </s>
<s>  she coloured as she spoke </s>
<s>  but neither that nor anything
else awakened a suspicion of the truth </s>
<s> 

the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary </s>
<s>  the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent </s>
<s> 
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth </s>
<s> 
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy
than felt herself to be so </s>
<s>  for besides the immediate embarrassment
there were other evils before her </s>
<s>  she anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known </s>
<s>  she was aware that no
one liked him but jane </s>
<s>  and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away </s>
<s> 

at night she opened her heart to jane </s>
<s>  though suspicion was very far
from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here </s>
<s> 

you are joking lizzy </s>
<s>  this cannot be </s>
<s> engaged to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  no no
you shall not deceive me </s>
<s>  i know it to be impossible </s>
<s> 

this is a wretched beginning indeed </s>
<s>  my sole dependence was on you </s>
<s>  and
i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not </s>
<s>  yet indeed i am
in earnest </s>
<s>  i speak nothing but the truth </s>
<s>  he still loves me and we are
engaged </s>
<s> 

jane looked at her doubtingly </s>
<s>  oh lizzy </s>
<s>  it cannot be </s>
<s>  i know how much
you dislike him </s>
<s> 

you know nothing of the matter </s>
<s>  that is all to be forgot </s>
<s>  perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now </s>
<s>  but in such cases as
these a good memory is unpardonable </s>
<s>  this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself </s>
<s> 

miss bennet still looked all amazement </s>
<s>  elizabeth again and more
seriously assured her of its truth </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>  can it be really so </s>
<s>  yet now i must believe you cried
jane </s>
<s>  my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you
certain </s>
<s>  forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be
happy with him </s>
<s> 

there can be no doubt of that </s>
<s>  it is settled between us already that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world </s>
<s>  but are you pleased
jane </s>
<s>  shall you like to have such a brother </s>
<s> 

very very much </s>
<s>  nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight </s>
<s>  but we considered it we talked of it as impossible </s>
<s>  and do you
really love him quite well enough </s>
<s>  oh lizzy </s>
<s>  do anything rather than
marry without affection </s>
<s>  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i
tell you all </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s> 

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley </s>
<s>  i am
afraid you will be angry </s>
<s> 

my dearest sister now be serious </s>
<s>  i want to talk very seriously </s>
<s>  let
me know every thing that i am to know without delay </s>
<s>  will you tell me
how long you have loved him </s>
<s> 

it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began </s>
<s> 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley </s>
<s> 

another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the
desired effect </s>
<s>  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment </s>
<s>  when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing
further to wish </s>
<s> 

now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself </s>
<s> 
i always had a value for him </s>
<s>  were it for nothing but his love of you
i must always have esteemed him </s>
<s>  but now as bingleys friend and your
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me </s>
<s>  but
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me </s>
<s>  how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton </s>
<s>  i owe all that i know
of it to another not to you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy </s>
<s>  she had been unwilling
to mention bingley </s>
<s>  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend </s>
<s>  but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage </s>
<s>  all was acknowledged
and half the night spent in conversation </s>
<s> 

                              

good gracious </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> bennet as she stood at a window the next
morning if that disagreeable <abvr> darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley </s>
<s>  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here </s>
<s>  i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or
other and not disturb us with his company </s>
<s>  what shall we do with him </s>
<s> 
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys
way </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal </s>
<s>  yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet </s>
<s> 

as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information </s>
<s> 
and he soon afterwards said aloud <abvr> bennet have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today </s>
<s> 

i advise <abvr> darcy and lizzy and kitty said <abvr> bennet to walk
to oakham mount this morning </s>
<s>  it is a nice long walk and <abvr> darcy has
never seen the view </s>
<s> 

it may do very well for the others replied <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty </s>
<s>  wont it kitty </s>
<s>  kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home </s>
<s>  darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented </s>
<s>  as she went
up stairs to get ready <abvr> bennet followed her saying </s>
<s> 

i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself </s>
<s>  but i hope you will not mind it </s>
<s>  it is
all for janes sake you know </s>
<s>  and there is no occasion for talking
to him except just now and then </s>
<s>  so do not put yourself to
inconvenience </s>
<s> 

during their walk it was resolved that <abvr> bennets consent should be
asked in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mothers </s>
<s>  she could not determine how her mother
would take it </s>
<s>  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man </s>
<s>  but whether she
were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense </s>
<s>  and she could no more bear that <abvr> darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation </s>
<s> 

                              

in the evening soon after <abvr> bennet withdrew to the library she saw
mr </s>
<s>  darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme </s>
<s>  she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to
be made unhappy </s>
<s>  and that it should be through her meansthat she
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched
reflection and she sat in misery till <abvr> darcy appeared again when
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile </s>
<s>  in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty </s>
<s>  and while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he
wants you in the library </s>
<s>  she was gone directly </s>
<s> 

her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious </s>
<s> 
lizzy said he what are you doing </s>
<s>  are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man </s>
<s>  have not you always hated him </s>
<s> 

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable her expressions more moderate </s>
<s>  it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give </s>
<s> 
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion
of her attachment to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

or in other words you are determined to have him </s>
<s>  he is rich to be
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane </s>
<s> 
but will they make you happy </s>
<s> 

have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my
indifference </s>
<s> 

none at all </s>
<s>  we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man </s>
<s>  but
this would be nothing if you really liked him </s>
<s> 

i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him </s>
<s> 
indeed he has no improper pride </s>
<s>  he is perfectly amiable </s>
<s>  you do not
know what he really is </s>
<s>  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms </s>
<s> 

lizzy said her father i have given him my consent </s>
<s>  he is the kind
of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he
condescended to ask </s>
<s>  i now give it to you if you are resolved on
having him </s>
<s>  but let me advise you to think better of it </s>
<s>  i know
your disposition lizzy </s>
<s>  i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband </s>
<s>  unless you looked
up to him as a superior </s>
<s>  your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage </s>
<s>  you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery </s>
<s>  my child let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life </s>
<s>  you know not what you are
about </s>
<s> 

elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply </s>
<s>  and
at length by repeated assurances that <abvr> darcy was really the object
of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months
suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did
conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match </s>
<s> 

well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to
say </s>
<s>  if this be the case he deserves you </s>
<s>  i could not have parted with
you my lizzy to anyone less worthy </s>
<s> 

to complete the favourable impression she then told him what <abvr> darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia </s>
<s>  he heard her with astonishment </s>
<s> 

this is an evening of wonders indeed </s>
<s>  and so darcy did every thing </s>
<s> 
made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him
his commission </s>
<s>  so much the better </s>
<s>  it will save me a world of trouble
and economy </s>
<s>  had it been your uncles doing i must and would have
paid him </s>
<s>  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way </s>
<s>  i shall offer to pay him tomorrow </s>
<s>  he will rant and storm about
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter </s>
<s> 

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr </s>
<s>  collinss letter </s>
<s>  and after laughing at her some time allowed her
at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure </s>
<s> 

elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight </s>
<s>  and after
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure </s>
<s>  every thing was too recent for
gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away </s>
<s>  there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time </s>
<s> 

when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her
and made the important communication </s>
<s>  its effect was most extraordinary </s>
<s> 
for on first hearing it <abvr> bennet sat quite still and unable to
utter a syllable </s>
<s>  nor was it under many many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard </s>
<s>  though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them </s>
<s>  she began at length to recover to fidget about in
her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  lord bless me </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s>  dear me </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  who would
have thought it </s>
<s>  and is it really true </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  my sweetest lizzy </s>
<s>  how rich
and how great you will be </s>
<s>  what pinmoney what jewels what carriages
you will have </s>
<s>  janes is nothing to itnothing at all </s>
<s>  i am so
pleasedso happy </s>
<s>  such a charming man </s>
<s> so handsome </s>
<s>  so tall </s>
<s> oh my
dear lizzy </s>
<s>  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before </s>
<s>  i
hope he will overlook it </s>
<s>  dear dear lizzy </s>
<s>  a house in town </s>
<s>  every thing
that is charming </s>
<s>  three daughters married </s>
<s>  ten thousand a year </s>
<s>  oh
lord </s>
<s>  what will become of me </s>
<s>  i shall go distracted </s>
<s> 

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself
soon went away </s>
<s>  but before she had been three minutes in her own room
her mother followed her </s>
<s> 

my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else </s>
<s>  ten
thousand a year and very likely more </s>
<s>  ˜tis as good as a lord </s>
<s>  and a
special licence </s>
<s>  you must and shall be married by a special licence </s>
<s>  but
my dearest love tell me what dish <abvr> darcy is particularly fond of
that i may have it tomorrow </s>
<s> 

this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be </s>
<s>  and elizabeth found that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations
consent there was still something to be wished for </s>
<s>  but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to
him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her
deference for his opinion </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem </s>
<s> 

i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he </s>
<s>  wickham perhaps
is my favourite </s>
<s>  but i think i shall like your husband quite as well
as janes </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted <abvr>
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her </s>
<s>  how could
you begin </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  i can comprehend your going on charmingly when
you had once made a beginning </s>
<s>  but what could set you off in the first
place </s>
<s> 

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which
laid the foundation </s>
<s>  it is too long ago </s>
<s>  i was in the middle before i
knew that i had begun </s>
<s> 

my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not </s>
<s>  now be sincere </s>
<s> 
did you admire me for my impertinence </s>
<s> 

for the liveliness of your mind i did </s>
<s> 

you may as well call it impertinence at once </s>
<s>  it was very little less </s>
<s> 
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious
attention </s>
<s>  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking and thinking for your approbation alone </s>
<s>  i roused and
interested you because i was so unlike them </s>
<s>  had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it </s>
<s>  but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just </s>
<s>  and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you </s>
<s>  therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it </s>
<s>  and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable </s>
<s>  to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks
of that when they fall in love </s>
<s> 

was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was
ill at netherfield </s>
<s> 

dearest jane </s>
<s>  who could have done less for her </s>
<s>  but make a virtue of it
by all means </s>
<s>  my good qualities are under your protection and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible </s>
<s>  and in return it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be </s>
<s>  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last </s>
<s>  what made you so shy of me when you first
called and afterwards dined here </s>
<s>  why especially when you called did
you look as if you did not care about me </s>
<s> 

because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement </s>
<s> 

but i was embarrassed </s>
<s> 

and so was i </s>
<s> 

you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner </s>
<s> 

a man who had felt less might </s>
<s> 

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it </s>
<s>  but i wonder how long you
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself </s>
<s>  i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not asked you </s>
<s>  my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect </s>
<s> 
too much i am afraid </s>
<s>  for what becomes of the moral if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise </s>
<s>  for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject </s>
<s>  this will never do </s>
<s> 

you need not distress yourself </s>
<s>  the moral will be perfectly fair </s>
<s>  lady
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts </s>
<s>  i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude </s>
<s>  i was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours </s>
<s>  my aunts intelligence had given me
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing </s>
<s> 

lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy
for she loves to be of use </s>
<s>  but tell me what did you come down to
netherfield for </s>
<s>  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed </s>
<s> 
or had you intended any more serious consequence </s>
<s> 

my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i
might ever hope to make you love me </s>
<s>  my avowed one or what i avowed to
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made </s>
<s> 

shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her </s>
<s> 

i am more likely to want more time than courage elizabeth </s>
<s>  but it
ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be
done directly </s>
<s> 

and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did </s>
<s>  but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected </s>
<s> 

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <abvr> darcy
had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered <abvr> gardiners
long letter </s>
<s>  but now having that to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as
follows </s>
<s> 

i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done
for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars </s>
<s>  but to say the
truth i was too cross to write </s>

mr </s>
<s>  darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style </s>
<s>  and still
different from either was what <abvr> bennet sent to <abvr> collins in reply
to his last </s>
<s> 

dear sir

i must trouble you once more for congratulations </s>
<s>  elizabeth will soon
be the wife of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  console lady catherine as well as you can </s>
<s> 
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew </s>
<s>  he has more to give </s>
<s> 

yours sincerely etc </s>
<s> 

miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere </s>
<s>  she wrote even
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her
former professions of regard </s>
<s>  jane was not deceived but she was
affected </s>
<s>  and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved </s>
<s> 

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information
was as sincere as her brothers in sending it </s>
<s>  four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister </s>
<s> 

before any answer could arrive from <abvr> collins or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge </s>
<s>  the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident </s>
<s>  lady catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that
charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over </s>
<s>  at such a moment the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she
saw <abvr> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband </s>
<s>  he bore it however with admirable calmness </s>
<s>  he could even
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st </s>
<s>  jamess with very decent composure </s>
<s>  if he did
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance </s>
<s>  and though <abvr> phillips as well as her sister stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good
humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar </s>
<s> 
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all
likely to make her more elegant </s>
<s>  elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification </s>
<s>  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it
added to the hope of the future </s>
<s>  and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley </s>

chapter 


happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <abvr> bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters </s>
<s>  with what delighted pride
she afterwards visited <abvr> bingley and talked of <abvr> darcy may
be guessed </s>
<s>  i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible
amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life </s>
<s>  though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly </s>
<s>  his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do </s>
<s>  he delighted in
going to pemberley especially when he was least expected </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
his easy temper or her affectionate heart </s>
<s>  the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified </s>
<s>  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other </s>
<s> 

kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters </s>
<s>  in society so superior to what she had generally
known her improvement was great </s>
<s>  she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia </s>
<s>  and removed from the influence of lydias example
she became by proper attention and management less irritable less
ignorant and less insipid </s>
<s>  from the further disadvantage of lydias
society she was of course carefully kept and though <abvr> wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of
balls and young men her father would never consent to her going </s>
<s> 

mary was the only daughter who remained at home </s>
<s>  and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <abvr> bennets being quite
unable to sit alone </s>
<s>  mary was obliged to mix more with the world but
she could still moralize over every morning visit </s>
<s>  and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance </s>
<s> 

as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters </s>
<s>  he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her </s>
<s>  and in spite of every
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune </s>
<s>  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least
if not by himself such a hope was cherished </s>
<s>  the letter was to this
effect </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy

i wish you joy </s>
<s>  if you love <abvr> darcy half as well as i do my dear
wickham you must be very happy </s>
<s>  it is a great comfort to have you so
rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us </s>
<s> 
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help </s>
<s> 
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year </s>
<s>  but however
do not speak to <abvr> darcy about it if you had rather not </s>
<s> 

yours etc </s>
<s> 

as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind </s>
<s> 
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she
frequently sent them </s>
<s>  it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to
their support </s>
<s>  and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills </s>
<s>  their manner of living even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the
extreme </s>
<s>  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation and always spending more than they ought </s>
<s>  his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference </s>
<s>  hers lasted a little longer </s>
<s>  and
in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her </s>
<s> 

though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for
elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession </s>
<s>  lydia was
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath </s>
<s>  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone </s>
<s> 

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage </s>
<s>  but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she
dropt all her resentment </s>
<s>  was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

pemberley was now georgianas home </s>
<s>  and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see </s>
<s>  they were able to love each
other even as well as they intended </s>
<s>  georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth </s>
<s>  though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of
talking to her brother </s>
<s>  he who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open
pleasantry </s>
<s>  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way </s>
<s>  by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself </s>
<s> 

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew </s>
<s> 
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him
language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time
all intercourse was at an end </s>
<s>  but at length by elizabeths persuasion
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation </s>
<s> 
and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself </s>
<s>  and she condescended to wait
on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city </s>
<s> 

with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms </s>
<s> 
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them </s>
<s>  and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing
her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them </s>
<s>
