mrs </s>
<s>  bates and <abvr> elton were together </s>
<s>  miss bates was out which
accounted for the previous tranquillity </s>
<s>  emma could have wished <abvr>
elton elsewhere </s>
<s>  but she was in a humour to have patience with every
body </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the
rencontre would do them no harm </s>
<s> 

she soon believed herself to penetrate <abvr> eltons thoughts and
understand why she was like herself in happy spirits </s>
<s>  it was being in
miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was
still a secret to other people </s>
<s>  emma saw symptoms of it immediately in
the expression of her face </s>
<s>  and while paying her own compliments to <abvr>
bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladys replies she saw
her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she
had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into
the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods

we can finish this some other time you know </s>
<s>  you and i shall not want
opportunities </s>
<s>  and in fact you have heard all the essential already </s>
<s>  i
only wanted to prove to you that <abvr> s </s>

not offended </s>
<s>  you see how delightfully she writes </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she is a sweet
creature </s>
<s>  you would have doated on her had you gone </s>
<s> but not a word
more </s>
<s>  let us be discreetquite on our good behaviour </s>
<s> hush </s>
<s> you
remember those linesi forget the poem at this moment </s>
<s> 

        for when a ladys in the case
        you know all other things give place </s>
<s> 

now i say my dear in our case for lady readmum </s>
<s>  a word to
the wise </s>
<s> i am in a fine flow of spirits ant i </s>
<s>  but i want to set
your heart at ease as to <abvr> s </s>
<s> my representation you see has
quite appeased her </s>
<s> 

and again on emmas merely turning her head to look at <abvr> batess
knitting she added in a half whisper

i mentioned no names you will observe </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  cautious as a
minister of state </s>
<s>  i managed it extremely well </s>
<s> 

emma could not doubt </s>
<s>  it was a palpable display repeated on every
possible occasion </s>
<s>  when they had all talked a little while in harmony of
the weather and <abvr> weston she found herself abruptly addressed with

do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered </s>
<s> do not you think her cure does perry the highest
credit </s>
<s> here was a sideglance of great meaning at jane </s>
<s>  upon my
word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  if you had
seen her as i did when she was at the worst </s>
<s> and when <abvr> bates
was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word
of any assistance that perry might have </s>
<s>  not a word of a certain young
physician from windsor </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  perry shall have all the credit </s>
<s> 

i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she
shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill </s>
<s>  very pleasant
party </s>
<s>  but yet i think there was something wanting </s>
<s>  things did not
seemthat is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some </s>
<s> so
it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken </s>
<s>  however i think
it answered so far as to tempt one to go again </s>
<s>  what say you both to our
collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the
fine weather lasts </s>
<s> it must be the same party you know quite the
same party not one exception </s>
<s> 

soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being
diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting
she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say
every thing </s>
<s> 

thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness </s>
<s> it is impossible
to sayyes indeed i quite understanddearest janes prospectsthat
is i do not mean </s>
<s> but she is charmingly recovered </s>
<s> how is <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s> i am so glad </s>
<s> quite out of my power </s>
<s> such a happy little
circle as you find us here </s>
<s> yes indeed </s>
<s> charming young man </s>
<s> that
isso very friendly </s>
<s>  i mean good <abvr> perry </s>
<s> such attention to
jane </s>
<s> and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight
towards <abvr> elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a
little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter
which was now graciously overcome </s>
<s> after a few whispers indeed which
placed it beyond a guess <abvr> elton speaking louder said

yes here i am my good friend </s>
<s>  and here i have been so long that
anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise </s>
<s>  but the truth
is that i am waiting for my lord and master </s>
<s>  he promised to join me
here and pay his respects to you </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  are we to have the pleasure of a call from <abvr> elton </s>
<s> that will
be a favour indeed </s>
<s>  for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and
mr </s>
<s>  eltons time is so engaged </s>
<s> 

upon my word it is miss bates </s>
<s> he really is engaged from morning to
night </s>
<s> there is no end of peoples coming to him on some pretence or
other </s>
<s> the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always
wanting his opinion </s>
<s>  they seem not able to do any thing without
him </s>
<s> òupon my word <abvr> e </s>
<s>  i often say òrather you than i </s>
<s> i do
not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had
half so many applicants </s>
<s> bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect
them both to an unpardonable degree </s>
<s> i believe i have not played a bar
this fortnight </s>
<s> however he is coming i assure you </s>
<s>  yes indeed on
purpose to wait on you all </s>
<s>  and putting up her hand to screen her
words from emmaa congratulatory visit you know </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yes quite
indispensable </s>
<s> 

miss bates looked about her so happily </s>
<s> 

he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from knightley </s>
<s>  but he and knightley are shut up together in deep
consultation </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  e </s>
<s>  is knightleys right hand </s>
<s> 

emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is <abvr> elton
gone on foot to donwell </s>
<s> he will have a hot walk </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting </s>
<s>  weston and
cole will be there too </s>
<s>  but one is apt to speak only of those who
lead </s>
<s> i fancy <abvr> e </s>
<s>  and knightley have every thing their own way </s>
<s> 

have not you mistaken the day </s>
<s>  said emma </s>
<s>  i am almost certain that
the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrow </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightley was at
hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer which
denoted the impossibility of any blunder on <abvr> eltons side </s>
<s> i do
believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever
was </s>
<s>  we never heard of such things at maple grove </s>
<s> 

your parish there was small said jane </s>
<s> 

upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject
talked of </s>
<s> 

but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard
you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and <abvr> bragge </s>
<s>  the
only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you clever creature thats very true </s>
<s>  what a thinking brain you
have </s>
<s>  i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we
could be shaken together </s>
<s>  my liveliness and your solidity would produce
perfection </s>
<s> not that i presume to insinuate however that some
people may not think you perfection already </s>
<s> but hush </s>
<s> not a word
if you please </s>
<s> 

it seemed an unnecessary caution </s>
<s>  jane was wanting to give her words
not to <abvr> elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw </s>
<s> 
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very
evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton made his appearance </s>
<s>  his lady greeted him with some of her
sparkling vivacity </s>
<s> 

very pretty sir upon my word </s>
<s>  to send me on here to be an
encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come </s>
<s> but
you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with </s>
<s>  you knew i should
not stir till my lord and master appeared </s>
<s> here have i been sitting
this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal
obediencefor who can say you know how soon it may be wanted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away </s>
<s> 
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid </s>
<s>  but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the
walk he had had for nothing </s>
<s> 

when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found </s>
<s>  very
odd </s>
<s>  very unaccountable </s>
<s>  after the note i sent him this morning and the
message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one </s>
<s> 

donwell </s>
<s>  cried his wife </s>
<s> my dear <abvr> e </s>
<s>  you have not been to
donwell </s>
<s> you mean the crown </s>
<s>  you come from the meeting at the crown </s>
<s> 

no no thats tomorrow </s>
<s>  and i particularly wanted to see knightley
today on that very account </s>
<s> such a dreadful broiling morning </s>
<s> i went
over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage which made
it so much the worse </s>
<s>  and then not to find him at home </s>
<s>  i assure you
i am not at all pleased </s>
<s>  and no apology left no message for me </s>
<s>  the
housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected </s>
<s> very
extraordinary </s>
<s> and nobody knew at all which way he was gone </s>
<s>  perhaps
to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods </s>
<s> miss
woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley </s>
<s> can you explain it </s>
<s> 

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary
indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him </s>
<s> 

i cannot imagine said <abvr> elton feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of
all people in the world </s>
<s>  the very last person whom one should expect to
be forgotten </s>
<s> my dear <abvr> e </s>
<s>  he must have left a message for you i am
sure he must </s>
<s> not even knightley could be so very eccentric </s>
<s> and his
servants forgot it </s>
<s>  depend upon it that was the case </s>
<s>  and very likely
to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed
extremely awkward and remiss </s>
<s> i am sure i would not have such a
creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration </s>
<s>  and
as for <abvr> hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed </s>
<s> she promised
wright a receipt and never sent it </s>
<s> 

i met william larkins continued <abvr> elton as i got near the house
and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not
believe him </s>
<s> william seemed rather out of humour </s>
<s>  he did not know what
was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the
speech of him </s>
<s>  i have nothing to do with williams wants but it really
is of very great importance that i should see knightley today </s>
<s>  and it
becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should
have had this hot walk to no purpose </s>
<s> 

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly </s>
<s>  in
all probability she was at this very time waited for there </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards
mr </s>
<s>  elton if not towards william larkins </s>
<s> 

she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to
attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs </s>
<s>  it gave her
an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say

it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility </s>
<s>  had you
not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to
introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might
have been strictly correct </s>
<s> i feel that i should certainly have been
impertinent </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual
composurethere would have been no danger </s>
<s>  the danger would have
been of my wearying you </s>
<s>  you could not have gratified me more than
by expressing an interest </s>
<s>  indeed miss woodhouse speaking more
collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very
great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those
of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not
disgusted to such a degree as toi have not time for half that i could
wish to say </s>
<s>  i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for
myself </s>
<s>  i feel it so very due </s>
<s>  but unfortunatelyin short if your
compassion does not stand my friend

oh </s>
<s>  you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and
taking her hand </s>
<s>  you owe me no apologies </s>
<s>  and every body to whom you
might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted
even

you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you </s>
<s> so
cold and artificial </s>
<s> i had always a part to act </s>
<s> it was a life of
deceit </s>
<s> i know that i must have disgusted you </s>
<s> 

pray say no more </s>
<s>  i feel that all the apologies should be on my side </s>
<s> 
let us forgive each other at once </s>
<s>  we must do whatever is to be done
quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there </s>
<s>  i hope you
have pleasant accounts from windsor </s>
<s> 

very </s>
<s> 

and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose youjust as
i begin to know you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet </s>
<s>  i am here
till claimed by colonel and <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 

nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma
smilingbut excuse me it must be thought of </s>
<s> 

the smile was returned as jane answered

you are very right </s>
<s>  it has been thought of </s>
<s>  and i will own to you i
am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with <abvr> churchill
at enscombe it is settled </s>
<s>  there must be three months at least of
deep mourning </s>
<s>  but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing
more to wait for </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you </s>

of </s>

chapter xvii


mrs </s>
<s>  westons friends were all made happy by her safety </s>
<s>  and if the
satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to emma it was by
knowing her to be the mother of a little girl </s>
<s>  she had been decided in
wishing for a miss weston </s>
<s>  she would not acknowledge that it was with
any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabellas
sons </s>
<s>  but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father
and mother best </s>
<s>  it would be a great comfort to <abvr> weston as he grew
olderand even <abvr> weston might be growing older ten years henceto
have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home </s>
<s>  and <abvr> westonno
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her </s>
<s>  and it would be
quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have
their powers in exercise again </s>
<s> 

she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she
continuedlike la baronne dalmane on la comtesse dostalis in madame
de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little
adelaide educated on a more perfect plan </s>
<s> 

that is replied <abvr> knightley she will indulge her even more than
she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all </s>
<s>  it will
be the only difference </s>
<s> 

poor child </s>
<s>  cried emma </s>
<s>  at that rate what will become of her </s>
<s> 

nothing very bad </s>
<s> the fate of thousands </s>
<s>  she will be disagreeable
in infancy and correct herself as she grows older </s>
<s>  i am losing all my
bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma </s>
<s>  i who am owing all
my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be
severe on them </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and replied </s>
<s>  but i had the assistance of all your
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people </s>
<s>  i doubt whether
my own sense would have corrected me without it </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s> i have no doubt </s>
<s>  nature gave you understanding </s>
<s> miss taylor
gave you principles </s>
<s>  you must have done well </s>
<s>  my interference was quite
as likely to do harm as good </s>
<s>  it was very natural for you to say what
right has he to lecture me </s>
<s> and i am afraid very natural for you to
feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner </s>
<s>  i do not believe i did
you any good </s>
<s>  the good was all to myself by making you an object of the
tenderest affection to me </s>
<s>  i could not think about you so much without
doating on you faults and all </s>
<s>  and by dint of fancying so many errors
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least </s>
<s> 

i am sure you were of use to me cried emma </s>
<s>  i was very often
influenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time </s>
<s>  i
am very sure you did me good </s>
<s>  and if poor little anna weston is to be
spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her
as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is
thirteen </s>
<s> 

how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your
saucy looksòmr </s>
<s>  knightley i am going to do soandso </s>
<s>  papa says i
may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which you knew i
did not approve </s>
<s>  in such cases my interference was giving you two bad
feelings instead of one </s>
<s> 

what an amiable creature i was </s>
<s> no wonder you should hold my speeches
in such affectionate remembrance </s>
<s> 

òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> you always called me òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  and from
habit it has not so very formal a sound </s>
<s> and yet it is formal </s>
<s>  i want
you to call me something else but i do not know what </s>
<s> 

i remember once calling you ògeorge in one of my amiable fits about
ten years ago </s>
<s>  i did it because i thought it would offend you </s>
<s>  but as
you made no objection i never did it again </s>
<s> 

and cannot you call me ògeorge now </s>
<s> 

impossible </s>
<s> i never can call you any thing but òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  i
will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of <abvr> elton by
calling you <abvr> k </s>
<s> but i will promise she added presently laughing
and blushingi will promise to call you once by your christian name </s>
<s> 
i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where </s>
<s> in the building in
which n </s>
<s>  takes m </s>
<s>  for better for worse </s>
<s> 

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important
service which his better sense would have rendered her to the
advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly
folliesher wilful intimacy with harriet smith </s>
<s>  but it was too tender a
subject </s>
<s> she could not enter on it </s>
<s> harriet was very seldom mentioned
between them </s>
<s>  this on his side might merely proceed from her not being
thought of </s>
<s>  but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy
and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were
declining </s>
<s>  she was aware herself that parting under any other
circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that
her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on
isabellas letters </s>
<s>  he might observe that it was so </s>
<s>  the pain of being
obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to
the pain of having made harriet unhappy </s>
<s> 

isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be
expected </s>
<s>  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which
appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted </s>
<s>  but
since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet
different from what she had known her before </s>
<s> isabella to be sure
was no very quick observer </s>
<s>  yet if harriet had not been equal to playing
with the children it would not have escaped her </s>
<s>  emmas comforts and
hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriets being to stay longer </s>
<s> 
her fortnight was likely to be a month at least </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> john
knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain
till they could bring her back </s>
<s> 

john does not even mention your friend said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  here is
his answer if you like to see it </s>
<s> 

it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage </s>
<s>  emma
accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know
what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her
friend was unmentioned </s>
<s> 

john enters like a brother into my happiness continued <abvr> knightley
but he is no complimenter </s>
<s>  and though i well know him to have
likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making
flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in
her praise </s>
<s>  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes </s>
<s> 

he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the
letter </s>
<s>  i honour his sincerity </s>
<s>  it is very plain that he considers the
good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not
without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as
you think me already </s>
<s>  had he said any thing to bear a different
construction i should not have believed him </s>
<s> 

my emma he means no such thing </s>
<s>  he only means

he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two
 interrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps than
he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the
subject </s>
<s> 

emma my dear emma

oh </s>
<s>  she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother
does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret
and hear his opinion </s>
<s>  depend upon it he will be much farther from doing
you justice </s>
<s>  he will think all the happiness all the advantage on
your side of the question </s>
<s>  all the merit on mine </s>
<s>  i wish i may not
sink into òpoor emma with him at once </s>
<s> his tender compassion towards
oppressed worth can go no farther </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as
john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be
happy together </s>
<s>  i am amused by one part of johns letterdid you notice
it </s>
<s> where he says that my information did not take him wholly by
surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the
kind </s>
<s> 

if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying </s>
<s>  he had no idea of me </s>
<s>  he seems perfectly
unprepared for that </s>
<s> 

yes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into my
feelings </s>
<s>  what has he been judging by </s>
<s> i am not conscious of any
difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at
this time for my marrying any more than at another </s>
<s> but it was so i
suppose </s>
<s>  i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them
the other day </s>
<s>  i believe i did not play with the children quite so much
as usual </s>
<s>  i remember one evening the poor boys saying òuncle seems
always tired now </s>
<s> 

the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other
persons reception of it tried </s>
<s>  as soon as <abvr> weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit <abvr> woodhouses visits emma having it in view that
her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to
announce it at home and then at randalls </s>
<s> but how to break it to her
father at last </s>
<s> she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of <abvr>
knightleys absence or when it came to the point her heart would have
failed her and she must have put it off </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley was to come
at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make </s>
<s> she was
forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too </s>
<s>  she must not make it a
more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself </s>
<s> 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune </s>
<s> with all the spirits she
could command she prepared him first for something strange and then
in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be
obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with no difficulty
since it was a plan to promote the happiness of allshe and <abvr>
knightley meant to marry </s>
<s>  by which means hartfield would receive the
constant addition of that persons company whom she knew he loved next
to his daughters and <abvr> weston best in the world </s>
<s> 

poor man </s>
<s> it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried
earnestly to dissuade her from it </s>
<s>  she was reminded more than once of
having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be
a great deal better for her to remain single </s>
<s>  and told of poor isabella
and poor miss taylor </s>
<s> but it would not do </s>
<s>  emma hung about him
affectionately and smiled and said it must be so </s>
<s>  and that he must
not class her with isabella and <abvr> weston whose marriages taking them
from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change </s>
<s>  but she was not
going from hartfield </s>
<s>  she should be always there </s>
<s>  she was introducing
no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better </s>
<s>  and she
was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having <abvr>
knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea </s>
<s> did
he not love <abvr> knightley very much </s>
<s> he would not deny that he did
she was sure </s>
<s> whom did he ever want to consult on business but <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters
who so glad to assist him </s>
<s> who so cheerful so attentive so attached
to him </s>
<s> would not he like to have him always on the spot </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s>  that
was all very true </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley could not be there too often </s>
<s>  he should
be glad to see him every day </s>
<s> but they did see him every day as it
was </s>
<s> why could not they go on as they had done </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse could not be soon reconciled </s>
<s>  but the worst was overcome
the idea was given </s>
<s>  time and continual repetition must do the rest </s>
<s> to
emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded <abvr> knightleys whose fond
praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome </s>
<s>  and he was soon
used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion </s>
<s> they had all
the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest
approbation </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston was ready on the first meeting to
consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst as a settled
and secondly as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance
of the two recommendations to <abvr> woodhouses mind </s>
<s> it was agreed
upon as what was to be </s>
<s>  and every body by whom he was used to be
guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness </s>
<s>  and having some

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread </s>

familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind </s>

of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife </s>

was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it </s>

had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it

chapter xviii


time passed on </s>
<s>  a few more tomorrows and the party from london would
be arriving </s>
<s>  it was an alarming change </s>
<s>  and emma was thinking of it one
morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when
mr </s>
<s>  knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by </s>
<s>  after the
first chat of pleasure he was silent </s>
<s>  and then in a graver tone began
with

i have something to tell you emma </s>
<s>  some news </s>
<s> 

good or bad </s>
<s>  said she quickly looking up in his face </s>
<s> 

i do not know which it ought to be called </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  good i am sure </s>
<s> i see it in your countenance </s>
<s>  you are trying not
to smile </s>
<s> 

i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid
my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  but why so </s>
<s> i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases
or amuses you should not please and amuse me too </s>
<s> 

there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not
think alike </s>
<s>  he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on
her face </s>
<s>  does nothing occur to you </s>
<s> do not you recollect </s>
<s> harriet
smith </s>
<s> 

her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though
she knew not what </s>
<s> 

have you heard from her yourself this morning </s>
<s>  cried he </s>
<s>  you have i
believe and know the whole </s>
<s> 

no i have not </s>
<s>  i know nothing </s>
<s>  pray tell me </s>
<s> 

you are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is </s>
<s>  harriet
smith marries robert martin </s>
<s> 

emma gave a start which did not seem like being preparedand her eyes
in eager gaze said no this is impossible </s>
<s>  but her lips were closed </s>
<s> 

it is so indeed continued <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i have it from robert
martin himself </s>
<s>  he left me not half an hour ago </s>
<s> 

she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement </s>
<s> 

you like it my emma as little as i feared </s>
<s> i wish our opinions were
the same </s>
<s>  but in time they will </s>
<s>  time you may be sure will make one
or the other of us think differently </s>
<s>  and in the meanwhile we need not
talk much on the subject </s>
<s> 

you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself </s>
<s> 
it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i
cannot believe it </s>
<s>  it seems an impossibility </s>
<s> you cannot mean to say
that harriet smith has accepted robert martin </s>
<s>  you cannot mean that he
has even proposed to her againyet </s>
<s>  you only mean that he intends it </s>
<s> 

i mean that he has done it answered <abvr> knightley with smiling but
determined decision and been accepted </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> then having recourse to her workbasket
in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite
feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be
expressing she added well now tell me every thing </s>
<s>  make this
intelligible to me </s>
<s>  how where when </s>
<s> let me know it all </s>
<s>  i never was
more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy i assure you </s>
<s> howhow
has it been possible </s>
<s> 

it is a very simple story </s>
<s>  he went to town on business three days ago
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send
to john </s>
<s> he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was
asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys </s>
<s>  they were
going to take the two eldest boys to astleys </s>
<s>  the party was to be our
brother and sister henry johnand miss smith </s>
<s>  my friend robert could
not resist </s>
<s>  they called for him in their way </s>
<s>  were all extremely amused </s>
<s> 
and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he
didand in the course of that visit as i understand he found an
opportunity of speaking to harriet </s>
<s>  and certainly did not speak
in vain </s>
<s> she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is
deserving </s>
<s>  he came down by yesterdays coach and was with me this
morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first
on my affairs and then on his own </s>
<s>  this is all that i can relate of
the how where and when </s>
<s>  your friend harriet will make a much
longer history when you see her </s>
<s> she will give you all the minute
particulars which only womans language can make interesting </s>
<s> in our
communications we deal only in the great </s>
<s> however i must say that
robert martins heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing </s>
<s> 
and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that
on quitting their box at astleys my brother took charge of <abvr> john
knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry </s>
<s> 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith
rather uneasy </s>
<s> 

he stopped </s>
<s> emma dared not attempt any immediate reply </s>
<s>  to speak she
was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness </s>
<s> 
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad </s>
<s>  her silence disturbed
him </s>
<s>  and after observing her a little while he added

emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you
unhappy </s>
<s>  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected </s>
<s>  his
situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies your
friend </s>
<s>  and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him
as you know him more </s>
<s>  his good sense and good principles would delight
you </s>
<s> as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend
in better hands </s>
<s>  his rank in society i would alter if i could which is
saying a great deal i assure you emma </s>
<s> you laugh at me about william
larkins </s>
<s>  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin </s>
<s> 

he wanted her to look up and smile </s>
<s>  and having now brought herself not
to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering

you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match </s>
<s>  i think
harriet is doing extremely well </s>
<s>  her connexions may be worse than
his </s>
<s>  in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they
are </s>
<s>  i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize </s>
<s>  you
cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me </s>
<s>  how peculiarly unprepared
i was </s>
<s> for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined
against him much more than she was before </s>
<s> 

you ought to know your friend best replied <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  but i
should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl not likely to be
very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her </s>
<s> 

emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe
you know her quite as well as i do </s>
<s> but <abvr> knightley are you
perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him </s>
<s> 
i could suppose she might in timebut can she already </s>
<s> did not you
misunderstand him </s>
<s> you were both talking of other things </s>
<s>  of business
shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you in the confusion of
so many subjects mistake him </s>
<s> it was not harriets hand that he was
certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox </s>
<s> 

the contrast between the countenance and air of <abvr> knightley and robert
martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings and so strong
was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriets
side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis
no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was
really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature </s>
<s> 
it could not be otherwise </s>
<s> 

do you dare say this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  do you dare to suppose me
so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of </s>
<s> what do
you deserve </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with
any other </s>
<s>  and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer </s>
<s>  are
you quite sure that you understand the terms on which <abvr> martin and
harriet now are </s>
<s> 

i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he
told me she had accepted him </s>
<s>  and that there was no obscurity nothing
doubtful in the words he used </s>
<s>  and i think i can give you a proof that
it must be so </s>
<s>  he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do </s>
<s>  he knew
of no one but <abvr> goddard to whom he could apply for information of
her relations or friends </s>
<s>  could i mention any thing more fit to be done
than to go to <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  i assured him that i could not </s>
<s>  then he
said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles
and most sincerely wish them happy </s>
<s> 

you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before </s>
<s> 

i hope sofor at that time i was a fool </s>
<s> 

and i am changed also </s>
<s>  for i am now very willing to grant you all
harriets good qualities </s>
<s>  i have taken some pains for your sake and for
robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much
in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her </s>
<s>  i have often
talked to her a good deal </s>
<s>  you must have seen that i did </s>
<s>  sometimes
indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor
martins cause which was never the case </s>
<s>  but from all my observations
i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good
notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in
the affections and utility of domestic life </s>
<s> much of this i have no
doubt she may thank you for </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  cried emma shaking her head </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  poor harriet </s>
<s> 

she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more
praise than she deserved </s>
<s> 

their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her
father </s>
<s>  she was not sorry </s>
<s>  she wanted to be alone </s>
<s>  her mind was in a
state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be
collected </s>
<s>  she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits </s>
<s>  and till she
had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she
could be fit for nothing rational </s>
<s> 

her fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put the
horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls </s>
<s>  and she
had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing </s>
<s> 

the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be
imagined </s>
<s>  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of
harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for
security </s>
<s> what had she to wish for </s>
<s>  nothing but to grow more worthy of
him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own </s>
<s> 
nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility
and circumspection in future </s>
<s> 

serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her
resolutions </s>
<s>  and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the
very midst of them </s>
<s>  she must laugh at such a close </s>
<s>  such an end of the
doleful disappointment of five weeks back </s>
<s>  such a heartsuch a harriet </s>
<s> 

now there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would be a
pleasure </s>
<s>  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin </s>
<s> 

high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the
reflection that all necessity of concealment from <abvr> knightley would
soon be over </s>
<s>  the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to
practise might soon be over </s>
<s>  she could now look forward to giving him
that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to
welcome as a duty </s>
<s> 

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father </s>
<s>  not
always listening but always agreeing to what he said </s>
<s>  and whether in
speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his
being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor <abvr> weston would be
disappointed </s>
<s> 

they arrived </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  weston was alone in the drawingroom </s>
<s> but hardly
had they been told of the baby and <abvr> woodhouse received the thanks
for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the
blind of two figures passing near the window </s>
<s> 

it is frank and miss fairfax said <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i was just going to
tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning </s>
<s>  he
stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the
day with us </s>
<s> they are coming in i hope </s>
<s> 

in half a minute they were in the room </s>
<s>  emma was extremely glad to
see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing
recollections on each side </s>
<s>  they met readily and smiling but with a
consciousness which at first allowed little to be said </s>
<s>  and having all
sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that
emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long
felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane
would yield its proportion of pleasure </s>
<s>  when <abvr> weston joined the
party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a
want of subject or animationor of courage and opportunity for frank
churchill to draw near her and say

i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message
in one of <abvr> westons letters </s>
<s>  i hope time has not made you less
willing to pardon </s>
<s>  i hope you do not retract what you then said </s>
<s> 

no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least </s>
<s>  i am
particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give you joy
in person </s>
<s> 

he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with
serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness </s>
<s> 

is not she looking well </s>
<s>  said he turning his eyes towards jane </s>
<s> 
better than she ever used to do </s>
<s> you see how my father and <abvr> weston
doat upon her </s>
<s> 

but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after
mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of
dixon </s>
<s> emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing </s>
<s> 

i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame </s>
<s> 

the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be </s>
<s>  but is it
possible that you had no suspicion </s>
<s> i mean of late </s>
<s>  early i know you
had none </s>
<s> 

i never had the smallest i assure you </s>
<s> 

that appears quite wonderful </s>
<s>  i was once very nearand i wish i
hadit would have been better </s>
<s>  but though i was always doing wrong
things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no
service </s>
<s> it would have been a much better transgression had i broken
the bond of secrecy and told you every thing </s>
<s> 

it is not now worth a regret said emma </s>
<s> 

i have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded to pay a
visit at randalls </s>
<s>  he wants to be introduced to her </s>
<s>  when the campbells
are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust
till we may carry her northward </s>
<s> but now i am at such a distance from
heris not it hard miss woodhouse </s>
<s> till this morning we have not
once met since the day of reconciliation </s>
<s>  do not you pity me </s>
<s> 

emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay
thought he cried

ah </s>
<s>  by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the
momenti hope <abvr> knightley is well </s>
<s>  he paused </s>
<s> she coloured and
laughed </s>
<s> i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish
in your favour </s>
<s>  let me return your congratulations </s>
<s> i assure you that
i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction </s>
<s> he is
a man whom i cannot presume to praise </s>
<s> 

emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style </s>
<s>  but
his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane
and his next words were

did you ever see such a skin </s>
<s> such smoothness </s>
<s>  such delicacy </s>
<s> and
yet without being actually fair </s>
<s> one cannot call her fair </s>
<s>  it is a
most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and haira most
distinguishing complexion </s>
<s>  so peculiarly the lady in it </s>
<s> just colour
enough for beauty </s>
<s> 

i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly </s>
<s>  but
do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so
pale </s>
<s> when we first began to talk of her </s>
<s> have you quite forgotten </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nowhat an impudent dog i was </s>
<s> how could i dare

but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help
saying

i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you
had very great amusement in tricking us all </s>
<s> i am sure you had </s>
<s> i am
sure it was a consolation to you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing </s>
<s>  i was the most
miserable wretch </s>
<s> 

not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth </s>
<s>  i am sure it was a
source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us
all in </s>
<s> perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the
truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same
situation </s>
<s>  i think there is a little likeness between us </s>
<s> 

he bowed </s>
<s> 

if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true
sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny </s>
<s>  the destiny which bids
fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own </s>
<s> 

true true he answered warmly </s>
<s>  no not true on your side </s>
<s>  you can
have no superior but most true on mine </s>
<s> she is a complete angel </s>
<s>  look
at her </s>
<s>  is not she an angel in every gesture </s>
<s>  observe the turn of her
throat </s>
<s>  observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father </s>
<s> you will
be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my
uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels </s>
<s>  they are to be new set </s>
<s> 
i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head </s>
<s>  will not it be
beautiful in her dark hair </s>
<s> 

very beautiful indeed replied emma </s>
<s>  and she spoke so kindly that he
gratefully burst out

how delighted i am to see you again </s>
<s>  and to see you in such excellent
looks </s>
<s> i would not have missed this meeting for the world </s>
<s>  i should
certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come </s>
<s> 

the others had been talking of the child <abvr> weston giving an account
of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the
infants appearing not quite well </s>
<s>  she believed she had been foolish
but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending
for <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  perhaps she ought to be ashamed but <abvr> weston had been
almost as uneasy as herself </s>
<s> in ten minutes however the child had
been perfectly well again </s>
<s>  this was her history </s>
<s>  and particularly
interesting it was to <abvr> woodhouse who commended her very much for
thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done
it </s>
<s>  she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the
slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment </s>
<s>  she could not be
too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often </s>
<s>  it was a pity perhaps
that he had not come last night </s>
<s>  for though the child seemed well now
very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had
seen it </s>
<s> 

frank churchill caught the name </s>
<s> 

perry </s>
<s>  said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss
fairfaxs eye </s>
<s>  my friend <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  what are they saying about <abvr>
perry </s>
<s> has he been here this morning </s>
<s> and how does he travel now </s>
<s> has
he set up his carriage </s>
<s> 

emma soon recollected and understood him </s>
<s>  and while she joined in the
laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she too was really
hearing him though trying to seem deaf </s>
<s> 

such an extraordinary dream of mine </s>
<s>  he cried </s>
<s>  i can never think of
it without laughing </s>
<s> she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i see
it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown </s>
<s>  look at her </s>
<s>  do
not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter
which sent me the report is passing under her eyethat the whole
blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else
though pretending to listen to the others </s>
<s> 

jane was forced to smile completely for a moment </s>
<s>  and the smile partly
remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet
steady voice

how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me </s>
<s> they
will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them </s>
<s> 

he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly </s>
<s>  but
emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument </s>
<s>  and on leaving
randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she
felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really
regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more
sensible of <abvr> knightleys high superiority of character </s>
<s>  the happiness
of this most happy day received its completion in the animated
contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced </s>

chapter xix


if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a
momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her
attachment to <abvr> knightley and really able to accept another man from
unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the
recurrence of any such uncertainty </s>
<s>  a very few days brought the party
from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour
alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable
as it was </s>
<s> that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted <abvr> knightley
and was now forming all her views of happiness </s>
<s> 

harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first </s>
<s> 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and
selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with
the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the
fullest exultation in the present and future </s>
<s>  for as to her friends
approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by
meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations </s>
<s> harriet was
most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleys and the
dinner the next day </s>
<s>  she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight </s>
<s> 
but what did such particulars explain </s>
<s> the fact was as emma could now
acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin </s>
<s>  and that his
continuing to love her had been irresistible </s>
<s> beyond this it must ever
be unintelligible to emma </s>
<s> 

the event however was most joyful </s>
<s>  and every day was giving her fresh
reason for thinking so </s>
<s> harriets parentage became known </s>
<s>  she proved
to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the
comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to
have always wished for concealment </s>
<s> such was the blood of gentility
which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for </s>
<s> it was likely to
be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman </s>
<s>  but what
a connexion had she been preparing for <abvr> knightleyor for the
churchillsor even for <abvr> elton </s>
<s> the stain of illegitimacy
unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed </s>
<s> 

no objection was raised on the fathers side </s>
<s>  the young man was treated
liberally </s>
<s>  it was all as it should be </s>
<s>  and as emma became acquainted
with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully
acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could
bid fairest for her little friend </s>
<s>  she had no doubt of harriets
happiness with any goodtempered man </s>
<s>  but with him and in the home he
offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and
improvement </s>
<s>  she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her
and who had better sense than herself </s>
<s>  retired enough for safety
and occupied enough for cheerfulness </s>
<s>  she would be never led into
temptation nor left for it to find her out </s>
<s>  she would be respectable
and happy </s>
<s>  and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the
world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a
man </s>
<s> or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself </s>
<s> 

harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins
was less and less at hartfield </s>
<s>  which was not to be regretted </s>
<s> the
intimacy between her and emma must sink </s>
<s>  their friendship must change
into a calmer sort of goodwill </s>
<s>  and fortunately what ought to be
and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural
manner </s>
<s> 

before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as
no remembrances even connected with <abvr> elton as he stood before them
could impair </s>
<s> perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw <abvr> elton
but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on
herself </s>
<s> robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of
the three were the first to be married </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells </s>
<s> the <abvr> churchills
were also in town </s>
<s>  and they were only waiting for november </s>
<s> 

the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by
emma and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> they had determined that their marriage ought
to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to
allow them the fortnights absence in a tour to the seaside which was
the plan </s>
<s> john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in
approving it </s>
<s>  but <abvr> woodhousehow was <abvr> woodhouse to be induced
to consent </s>
<s> he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a
distant event </s>
<s> 

when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were
almost hopeless </s>
<s> a second allusion indeed gave less pain </s>
<s> he
began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent ita very
promising step of the mind on its way to resignation </s>
<s>  still however he
was not happy </s>
<s>  nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters
courage failed </s>
<s>  she could not bear to see him suffering to know
him fancying himself neglected </s>
<s>  and though her understanding almost
acquiesced in the assurance of both the <abvr> knightleys that when
once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she
hesitatedshe could not proceed </s>
<s> 

in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden
illumination of <abvr> woodhouses mind or any wonderful change of his
nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another
way </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  westons poultryhouse was robbed one night of all her
turkeysevidently by the ingenuity of man </s>
<s>  other poultryyards in
the neighbourhood also suffered </s>
<s> pilfering was housebreaking to <abvr>
woodhouses fears </s>
<s> he was very uneasy </s>
<s>  and but for the sense of his
soninlaws protection would have been under wretched alarm every
night of his life </s>
<s>  the strength resolution and presence of mind of the
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys commanded his fullest dependence </s>
<s>  while either of them
protected him and his hartfield was safe </s>
<s> but <abvr> john knightley must
be in london again by the end of the first week in november </s>
<s> 

the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the
moment she was able to fix her weddingdayand <abvr> elton was called
on within a month from the marriage of <abvr> and <abvr> robert martin to
join the hands of <abvr> knightley and miss woodhouse </s>
<s> 

the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have
no taste for finery or parade </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton from the particulars
detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very
inferior to her own </s>
<s> very little white satin very few lace veils </s>
<s>  a
most pitiful business </s>
<s> selina would stare when she heard of it </s>
<s> but
in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence
the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the
ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union </s>
