<s> marley was dead </s>
<s>  to begin with </s>
<s>  there is no doubt
whatever about that </s>
<s>  the register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker
and the chief mourner </s>
<s>  scrooge signed it </s>
<s>  and
scrooges name was good upon change for anything he
chose to put his hand to </s>
<s>  old marley was as dead as a
doornail </s>
<s> 

mind </s>
<s>  i dont mean to say that i know of my
own knowledge what there is particularly dead about
a doornail </s>
<s>  i might have been inclined myself to
regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade </s>
<s>  but the wisdom of our ancestors
is in the simile </s>
<s>  and my unhallowed hands
shall not disturb it or the countrys done for </s>
<s>  you
will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that
marley was as dead as a doornail </s>
<s> 

scrooge knew he was dead </s>
<s>  of course he did </s>
<s> 
how could it be otherwise </s>
<s>  scrooge and he were
partners for i dont know how many years </s>
<s>  scrooge
was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole
assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and
sole mourner </s>
<s>  and even scrooge was not so dreadfully
cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of the funeral
and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain </s>
<s> 

the mention of marleys funeral brings me back to
the point i started from </s>
<s>  there is no doubt that marley
was dead </s>
<s>  this must be distinctly understood or
nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going
to relate </s>
<s>  if we were not perfectly convinced that
hamlets father died before the play began there
would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a
stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts
than there would be in any other middleaged
gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
spotsay saint pauls churchyard for instance
literally to astonish his sons weak mind </s>
<s> 

scrooge never painted out old marleys name </s>
<s> 
there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse
door </s>
<s>  scrooge and marley </s>
<s>  the firm was known as
scrooge and marley </s>
<s>  sometimes people new to the
business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley
but he answered to both names </s>
<s>  it was all the
same to him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but he was a tightfisted hand at the grindstone
scrooge </s>
<s>  a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping
clutching covetous old sinner </s>
<s>  hard and sharp as flint
from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire </s>
<s> 
secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster </s>
<s>  the
cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed
nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait </s>
<s>  made his
eyes red his thin lips blue </s>
<s>  and spoke out shrewdly in his
grating voice </s>
<s>  a frosty rime was on his head and on his
eyebrows and his wiry chin </s>
<s>  he carried his own low
temperature always about with him </s>
<s>  he iced his office in
the dogdays </s>
<s>  and didnt thaw it one degree at christmas </s>
<s> 

external heat and cold had little influence on
scrooge </s>
<s>  no warmth could warm no wintry weather
chill him </s>
<s>  no wind that blew was bitterer than he
no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no
pelting rain less open to entreaty </s>
<s>  foul weather didnt
know where to have him </s>
<s>  the heaviest rain and
snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage
over him in only one respect </s>
<s>  they often came down
handsomely and scrooge never did </s>
<s> 

nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with
gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you </s>
<s> 
when will you come to see me </s>
<s>  no beggars implored
him to bestow a trifle no children asked him
what it was oclock no man or woman ever once in all
his life inquired the way to such and such a place of
scrooge </s>
<s>  even the blind mens dogs appeared to
know him </s>
<s>  and when they saw him coming on would
tug their owners into doorways and up courts </s>
<s>  and
then would wag their tails as though they said no
eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master </s>
<s> 

but what did scrooge care </s>
<s>  it was the very thing
he liked </s>
<s>  to edge his way along the crowded paths
of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance
was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge </s>
<s> 

once upon a timeof all the good days in the year
on christmas eveold scrooge sat busy in his
countinghouse </s>
<s>  it was cold bleak biting weather </s>
<s>  foggy
withal </s>
<s>  and he could hear the people in the court outside
go wheezing up and down beating their hands
upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the
pavement stones to warm them </s>
<s>  the city clocks had
only just gone three but it was quite dark already
it had not been light all dayand candles were flaring
in the windows of the neighbouring offices like
ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air </s>
<s>  the fog
came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was
so dense without that although the court was of the
narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms </s>
<s> 
to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring
everything one might have thought that nature
lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale </s>
<s> 

the door of scrooges countinghouse was open
that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a
dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying
letters </s>
<s>  scrooge had a very small fire but the clerks
fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal </s>
<s>  but he couldnt replenish it for scrooge kept
the coalbox in his own room </s>
<s>  and so surely as the
clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted
that it would be necessary for them to part </s>
<s>  wherefore
the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to
warm himself at the candle </s>
<s>  in which effort not being
a man of a strong imagination he failed </s>
<s> 

a merry christmas uncle </s>
<s>  god save you </s>
<s>  cried
a cheerful voice </s>
<s>  it was the voice of scrooges
nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was
the first intimation he had of his approach </s>
<s> 

bah </s>
<s>  said scrooge humbug </s>
<s> 

he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
fog and frost this nephew of scrooges that he was
all in a glow </s>
<s>  his face was ruddy and handsome </s>
<s>  his
eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again </s>
<s> 

christmas a humbug uncle </s>
<s>  said scrooges
nephew </s>
<s>  you dont mean that i am sure </s>
<s> 

i do said scrooge </s>
<s>  merry christmas </s>
<s>  what
right have you to be merry </s>
<s>  what reason have you
to be merry </s>
<s>  youre poor enough </s>
<s> 

come then returned the nephew gaily </s>
<s>  what
right have you to be dismal </s>
<s>  what reason have you
to be morose </s>
<s>  youre rich enough </s>
<s> 

scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur
of the moment said bah </s>
<s>  again </s>
<s>  and followed it up
with humbug </s>
<s> 

dont be cross uncle </s>

<s> 

what else can i be returned the uncle when i
live in such a world of fools as this </s>
<s>  merry christmas </s>
<s> 
out upon merry christmas </s>
<s>  whats christmas
time to you but a time for paying bills without
money </s>
<s>  a time for finding yourself a year older but
not an hour richer </s>
<s>  a time for balancing your books
and having every item in em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you </s>
<s>  if i could
work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot
who goes about with merry christmas on his lips
should be boiled with his own pudding and buried
with a stake of holly through his heart </s>
<s>  he should </s>
<s> 

uncle </s>
<s>  pleaded the nephew </s>
<s> 

nephew </s>
<s>  returned the uncle sternly keep christmas
in your own way and let me keep it in mine </s>
<s> 

keep it </s>
<s>  repeated scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  but you
dont keep it </s>
<s> 

let me leave it alone then said scrooge </s>
<s>  much
good may it do you </s>
<s>  much good it has ever done
you </s>
<s> 

there are many things from which i might have
derived good by which i have not profited i dare
say returned the nephew </s>
<s>  christmas among the
rest </s>
<s>  but i am sure i have always thought of christmas
time when it has come roundapart from the
veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything
belonging to it can be apart from thatas a
good time </s>
<s>  a kind forgiving charitable pleasant
time </s>
<s>  the only time i know of in the long calendar
of the year when men and women seem by one consent
to open their shutup hearts freely and to think
of people below them as if they really were
fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race
of creatures bound on other journeys </s>
<s>  and therefore
uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me
good and will do me good </s>
<s>  and i say god bless it </s>
<s> 

the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded </s>
<s> 
becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety
he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark
for ever </s>
<s> 

let me hear another sound from you said
scrooge and youll keep your christmas by losing
your situation </s>
<s>  youre quite a powerful speaker
sir he added turning to his nephew </s>
<s>  i wonder you
dont go into parliament </s>
<s> 

dont be angry uncle </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  dine with us tomorrow </s>
<s> 

scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he
did </s>
<s>  he went the whole length of the expression
and said that he would see him in that extremity first </s>
<s> 

but why </s>
<s>  cried scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  why </s>
<s> 

why did you get married </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

because i fell in love </s>
<s> 

because you fell in love </s>
<s>  growled scrooge as if
that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous
than a merry christmas </s>
<s>  good afternoon </s>
<s> 

nay uncle but you never came to see me before
that happened </s>
<s>  why give it as a reason for not
coming now </s>
<s> 

good afternoon said scrooge </s>

i want nothing from you </s>

why cannot we be friends </s>
<s> 

good afternoon said scrooge </s>
<s> 

i am sorry with all my heart to find you so
resolute </s>
<s>  we have never had any quarrel to which i
have been a party </s>
<s>  but i have made the trial in
homage to christmas and ill keep my christmas
humour to the last </s>

<s> 

good afternoon </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

and a happy new year </s>
<s> 

good afternoon </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

his nephew left the room without an angry word
notwithstanding </s>
<s>  he stopped at the outer door to
bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who
cold as he was was warmer than scrooge </s>
<s>  for he returned
them cordially </s>
<s> 

theres another fellow muttered scrooge </s>
<s>  who
overheard him </s>
<s>  my clerk with fifteen shillings a
week and a wife and family talking about a merry
christmas </s>
<s>  ill retire to bedlam </s>
<s> 

this lunatic in letting scrooges nephew out had
let two other people in </s>
<s>  they were portly gentlemen
pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off
in scrooges office </s>
<s>  they had books and papers in
their hands and bowed to him </s>
<s> 

scrooge and marleys i believe said one of the
gentlemen referring to his list </s>
<s>  have i the pleasure
of addressing <abvr> scrooge or <abvr> marley </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  marley has been dead these seven years
scrooge replied </s>
<s>  he died seven years ago this very
night </s>
<s> 

we have no doubt his liberality is well represented
by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting
his credentials </s>
<s> 

it certainly was </s>
<s>  for they had been two kindred
spirits </s>
<s>  at the ominous word liberality scrooge
frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials
back </s>
<s> 

at this festive season of the year <abvr> scrooge
said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the poor and destitute who suffer
greatly at the present time </s>
<s>  many thousands are in
want of common necessaries </s>
<s>  hundreds of thousands
are in want of common comforts sir </s>
<s> 

are there no prisons </s>
<s>  asked scrooge </s>
<s> 

plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down
the pen again </s>
<s> 

and the union workhouses </s>
<s>  demanded scrooge </s>
<s> 
are they still in operation </s>
<s> 

they are </s>
<s>  still returned the gentleman i wish
i could say they were not </s>
<s> 

the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour
then </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

both very busy sir </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i was afraid from what you said at first
that something had occurred to stop them in their
useful course said scrooge </s>
<s>  im very glad to
hear it </s>
<s> 

under the impression that they scarcely furnish
christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude
returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring
to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink
and means of warmth </s>
<s>  we choose this time because
it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt
and abundance rejoices </s>
<s>  what shall i put you down
for </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  scrooge replied </s>
<s> 

you wish to be anonymous </s>
<s> 

i wish to be left alone said scrooge </s>
<s>  since you
ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer </s>
<s> 
i dont make merry myself at christmas and i cant
afford to make idle people merry </s>
<s>  i help to support
the establishments i have mentionedthey cost
enough </s>
<s>  and those who are badly off must go there </s>
<s> 

many cant go there </s>
<s>  and many would rather die </s>
<s> 

if they would rather die said scrooge they had
better do it and decrease the surplus population </s>
<s> 
besidesexcuse mei dont know that </s>
<s> 

but you might know it observed the gentleman </s>
<s> 

its not my business scrooge returned </s>
<s>  its
enough for a man to understand his own business and
not to interfere with other peoples </s>
<s>  mine occupies
me constantly </s>
<s>  good afternoon gentlemen </s>
<s> 

seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue
their point the gentlemen withdrew </s>
<s>  scrooge resumed
his labours with an improved opinion of himself
and in a more facetious temper than was usual
with him </s>
<s> 

meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that
people ran about with flaring links proffering their
services to go before horses in carriages and conduct
them on their way </s>
<s>  the ancient tower of a church
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became
invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the
clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if
its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there </s>
<s> 
the cold became intense </s>
<s>  in the main street at the
corner of the court some labourers were repairing
the gaspipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier
round which a party of ragged men and boys were
gathered </s>
<s>  warming their hands and winking their
eyes before the blaze in rapture </s>
<s>  the waterplug
being left in solitude its overflowings sullenly congealed
and turned to misanthropic ice </s>
<s>  the brightness
of the shops where holly sprigs and berries
crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale
faces ruddy as they passed </s>
<s>  poulterers and grocers
trades became a splendid joke </s>
<s>  a glorious pageant
with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything
to do </s>
<s>  the lord mayor in the stronghold of the
mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks
and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayors
household should </s>
<s>  and even the little tailor whom he
had fined five shillings on the previous monday for
being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets stirred up
tomorrows pudding in his garret while his lean
wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef </s>
<s> 

foggier yet and colder </s>
<s>  piercing searching biting
cold </s>
<s>  if the good saint dunstan had but nipped
the evil spirits nose with a touch of such weather
as that instead of using his familiar weapons then
indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose </s>
<s>  the
owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs
stooped down at scrooges keyhole to regale him with
a christmas carol </s>
<s>  but at the first sound of

        god bless you merry gentleman </s>
<s> 
         may nothing you dismay </s>
<s> 

scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action
that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to
the fog and even more congenial frost </s>
<s> 

at length the hour of shutting up the countinghouse
arrived </s>
<s>  with an illwill scrooge dismounted from his
stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant
clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out
and put on his hat </s>
<s> 

youll want all day tomorrow i suppose </s>
<s>  said
scrooge </s>
<s> 

if quite convenient sir </s>
<s> 

its not convenient said scrooge and its not
fair </s>
<s>  if i was to stop halfacrown for it youd
think yourself illused ill be bound </s>
<s> 

the clerk smiled faintly </s>
<s> 

and yet said scrooge you dont think me illused
when i pay a days wages for no work </s>
<s> 

the clerk observed that it was only once a year </s>
<s> 

a poor excuse for picking a mans pocket every
twentyfifth of december </s>
<s>  said scrooge buttoning
his greatcoat to the chin </s>
<s>  but i suppose you must
have the whole day </s>
<s>  be here all the earlier next
morning </s>
<s> 

the clerk promised that he would </s>
<s>  and scrooge
walked out with a growl </s>
<s>  the office was closed in a
twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his
white comforter dangling below his waist for he
boasted no greatcoat went down a slide on cornhill
at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in
honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home
to camden town as hard as he could pelt to play
at blindmansbuff </s>
<s> 

scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern </s>
<s>  and having read all the newspapers and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
bankersbook went home to bed </s>
<s>  he lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner </s>
<s>  they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a
lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so
little business to be that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house playing at hideandseek with other houses
and forgotten the way out again </s>
<s>  it was old enough
now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but
scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices </s>
<s> 
the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew
its every stone was fain to grope with his hands </s>
<s> 
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house that it seemed as if the genius of
the weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold </s>
<s> 

now it is a fact that there was nothing at all
particular about the knocker on the door except that it
was very large </s>
<s>  it is also a fact that scrooge had
seen it night and morning during his whole residence
in that place </s>
<s>  also that scrooge had as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
london even includingwhich is a bold wordthe
corporation aldermen and livery </s>
<s>  let it also be
borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on marley since his last mention of his
seven years dead partner that afternoon </s>
<s>  and then
let any man explain to me if he can how it happened
that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door
saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate
process of changenot a knocker but marleys face </s>
<s> 

marleys face </s>
<s>  it was not in impenetrable shadow
as the other objects in the yard were but had a
dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark
cellar </s>
<s>  it was not angry or ferocious but looked
at scrooge as marley used to look </s>
<s>  with ghostly
spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead </s>
<s>  the
hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air </s>
<s> 
and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly
motionless </s>
<s>  that and its livid colour made it
horrible </s>
<s>  but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
face and beyond its control rather than a part of
its own expression </s>
<s> 

as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it
was a knocker again </s>
<s> 

to say that he was not startled or that his blood
was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue </s>
<s> 
but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished
turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle </s>
<s> 

he did pause with a moments irresolution before
he shut the door </s>
<s>  and he did look cautiously behind
it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the
sight of marleys pigtail sticking out into the hall </s>
<s> 
but there was nothing on the back of the door except
the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he
said pooh pooh </s>
<s>  and closed it with a bang </s>
<s> 

the sound resounded through the house like thunder </s>
<s> 
every room above and every cask in the winemerchants
cellars below appeared to have a separate peal
of echoes of its own </s>
<s>  scrooge was not a man to
be frightened by echoes </s>
<s>  he fastened the door and
walked across the hall and up the stairs </s>
<s>  slowly too </s>
<s> 
trimming his candle as he went </s>
<s> 

you may talk vaguely about driving a coachandsix
up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad
young act of parliament </s>
<s>  but i mean to say you
might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken
it broadwise with the splinterbar towards the wall
and the door towards the balustrades </s>
<s>  and done it
easy </s>
<s>  there was plenty of width for that and room
to spare </s>
<s>  which is perhaps the reason why scrooge
thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before
him in the gloom </s>
<s>  halfadozen gaslamps out of
the street wouldnt have lighted the entry too well
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with
scrooges dip </s>
<s> 

up scrooge went not caring a button for that </s>
<s> 
darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it </s>
<s>  but before
he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms
to see that all was right </s>
<s>  he had just enough recollection
of the face to desire to do that </s>
<s> 

sittingroom bedroom lumberroom </s>
<s>  all as they
should be </s>
<s>  nobody under the table nobody under
the sofa </s>
<s>  a small fire in the grate </s>
<s>  spoon and basin
ready </s>
<s>  and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had
a cold in his head upon the hob </s>
<s>  nobody under the
bed </s>
<s>  nobody in the closet </s>
<s>  nobody in his dressinggown
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall </s>
<s>  lumberroom as usual </s>
<s>  old fireguard
old shoes two fishbaskets washingstand on three
legs and a poker </s>
<s> 

quite satisfied he closed his door and locked
himself in </s>
<s>  doublelocked himself in which was not his
custom </s>
<s>  thus secured against surprise he took off
his cravat </s>
<s>  put on his dressinggown and slippers and
his nightcap </s>
<s>  and sat down before the fire to take
his gruel </s>
<s> 

it was a very low fire indeed </s>
<s>  nothing on such a
bitter night </s>
<s>  he was obliged to sit close to it and
brood over it before he could extract the least
sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel </s>
<s> 
the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch
merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint
dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures </s>
<s> 
there were cains and abels pharaohs daughters </s>
<s> 
queens of sheba angelic messengers descending
through the air on clouds like featherbeds abrahams
belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butterboats
hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts </s>
<s> 
and yet that face of marley seven years dead came
like the ancient prophets rod and swallowed up the
whole </s>
<s>  if each smooth tile had been a blank at first
with power to shape some picture on its surface from
the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would
have been a copy of old marleys head on every one </s>
<s> 

humbug </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s>  and walked across the
room </s>
<s> 

after several turns he sat down again </s>
<s>  as he
threw his head back in the chair his glance happened
to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the
room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten
with a chamber in the highest story of the
building </s>
<s>  it was with great astonishment and with
a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he
saw this bell begin to swing </s>
<s>  it swung so softly in
the outset that it scarcely made a sound </s>
<s>  but soon it
rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house </s>
<s> 

this might have lasted half a minute or a minute
but it seemed an hour </s>
<s>  the bells ceased as they had
begun together </s>
<s>  they were succeeded by a clanking
noise deep down below </s>
<s>  as if some person were
dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
winemerchants cellar </s>
<s>  scrooge then remembered to have
heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
dragging chains </s>
<s> 

the cellardoor flew open with a booming sound
and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors
below </s>
<s>  then coming up the stairs </s>
<s>  then coming straight
towards his door </s>
<s> 

its humbug still </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s>  i wont believe it </s>
<s> 

his colour changed though when without a pause
it came on through the heavy door and passed into
the room before his eyes </s>
<s>  upon its coming in the
dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know
him </s>
<s>  marleys ghost </s>
<s>  and fell again </s>
<s> 

the same face </s>
<s>  the very same </s>
<s>  marley in his pigtail
usual waistcoat tights and boots </s>
<s>  the tassels on
the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coatskirts
and the hair upon his head </s>
<s>  the chain he drew was
clasped about his middle </s>
<s>  it was long and wound
about him like a tail </s>
<s>  and it was made for scrooge
observed it closely of cashboxes keys padlocks
ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel </s>
<s> 
his body was transparent </s>
<s>  so that scrooge observing him
and looking through his waistcoat could see
the two buttons on his coat behind </s>
<s> 

scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no
bowels but he had never believed it until now </s>
<s> 

no nor did he believe it even now </s>
<s>  though he
looked the phantom through and through and saw
it standing before him </s>
<s>  though he felt the chilling
influence of its deathcold eyes </s>
<s>  and marked the very
texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head
and chin which wrapper he had not observed before </s>
<s> 
he was still incredulous and fought against his senses </s>
<s> 

how now </s>
<s>  said scrooge caustic and cold as ever </s>
<s> 
what do you want with me </s>
<s> 

much </s>
<s> marleys voice no doubt about it </s>
<s> 

who are you </s>
<s> 

ask me who i was </s>

voice </s>

appropriate </s>

can youcan you sit down </s>
<s>  asked scrooge looking
doubtfully at him </s>
<s> 

i can </s>
<s> 

do it then </s>
<s> 

scrooge asked the question because he didnt know
whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
a condition to take a chair </s>
<s>  and felt that in the event
of its being impossible it might involve the necessity
of an embarrassing explanation </s>
<s>  but the ghost sat
down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he
were quite used to it </s>
<s> 

you dont believe in me observed the ghost </s>
<s> 

i dont said scrooge </s>
<s> 

what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
your senses </s>
<s> 

i dont know said scrooge </s>
<s> 

why do you doubt your senses </s>
<s> 

because said scrooge a little thing affects them </s>
<s> 
a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats </s>
<s>  you may
be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of
cheese a fragment of an underdone potato </s>
<s>  theres more of
gravy than of grave about you whatever you are </s>
<s> 

scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking
jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means
waggish then </s>
<s>  the truth is that he tried to be
smart as a means of distracting his own attention
and keeping down his terror </s>
<s>  for the spectres voice
disturbed the very marrow in his bones </s>
<s> 

to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence
for a moment would play scrooge felt the very
deuce with him </s>
<s>  there was something very awful
too in the spectres being provided with an infernal
atmosphere of its own </s>
<s>  scrooge could not feel it
himself but this was clearly the case </s>
<s>  for though the
ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts
and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour
from an oven </s>
<s> 

you see this toothpick </s>
<s>  said scrooge returning
quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned </s>
<s> 
and wishing though it were only for a second to
divert the visions stony gaze from himself </s>
<s> 

i do replied the ghost </s>
<s> 

you are not looking at it said scrooge </s>
<s> 

but i see it said the ghost notwithstanding </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  returned scrooge i have but to swallow
this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a
legion of goblins all of my own creation </s>
<s>  humbug
i tell you </s>
<s>  humbug </s>
<s> 

at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook
its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that
scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself
from falling in a swoon </s>
<s>  but how much greater was
his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage
round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors
its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast </s>
<s> 

scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands
before his face </s>
<s> 

mercy </s>
<s>  he said </s>
<s>  dreadful apparition why do
you trouble me </s>
<s> 

man of the worldly mind </s>
<s>  replied the ghost do
you believe in me or not </s>
<s> 

i do said scrooge </s>
<s>  i must </s>
<s>  but why do spirits
walk the earth and why do they come to me </s>
<s> 

it is required of every man the ghost returned
that the spirit within him should walk abroad among
his fellowmen and travel far and wide </s>
<s>  and if that
spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so
after death </s>
<s>  it is doomed to wander through the
worldoh woe is me </s>
<s> and witness what it cannot
share but might have shared on earth and turned to
happiness </s>
<s> 

again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain
and wrung its shadowy hands </s>
<s> 

you are fettered said scrooge trembling </s>
<s>  tell
me why </s>
<s> 

i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost </s>
<s> 
i made it link by link and yard by yard </s>
<s>  i girded
it on of my own free will and of my own free will i
wore it </s>
<s>  is its pattern strange to you </s>
<s> 

scrooge trembled more and more </s>
<s> 

or would you know pursued the ghost the
weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself </s>
<s> 
it was full as heavy and as long as this seven
christmas eves ago </s>
<s>  you have laboured on it since </s>
<s> 
it is a ponderous chain </s>
<s> 

scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the
expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
or sixty fathoms of iron cable </s>
<s>  but he could see
nothing </s>
<s> 

jacob he said imploringly </s>
<s>  old jacob marley
tell me more </s>
<s>  speak comfort to me jacob </s>
<s> 

i have none to give the ghost replied </s>
<s>  it comes
from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed
by other ministers to other kinds of men </s>
<s>  nor
can i tell you what i would </s>
<s>  a very little more is
all permitted to me </s>
<s>  i cannot rest i cannot stay i
cannot linger anywhere </s>
<s>  my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghousemark me </s>
<s> in life my
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
moneychanging hole </s>
<s>  and weary journeys lie before
me </s>
<s> 

it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became
thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets </s>
<s> 
pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now
but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his
knees </s>
<s> 

you must have been very slow about it jacob
scrooge observed in a businesslike manner though
with humility and deference </s>
<s> 

slow </s>
<s>  the ghost repeated </s>
<s> 

seven years dead mused scrooge </s>
<s>  and travelling
all the time </s>
<s> 

the whole time said the ghost </s>
<s>  no rest no
peace </s>
<s>  incessant torture of remorse </s>
<s> 

you travel fast </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

on the wings of the wind replied the ghost </s>
<s> 

you might have got over a great quantity of
ground in seven years said scrooge </s>
<s> 

the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and
clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of
the night that the ward would have been justified in
indicting it for a nuisance </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  captive bound and doubleironed cried the
phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour
by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into
eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is
all developed </s>
<s>  not to know that any christian spirit
working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may
be will find its mortal life too short for its vast
means of usefulness </s>
<s>  not to know that no space of
regret can make amends for one lifes opportunity
misused </s>
<s>  yet such was i </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  such was i </s>
<s> 

but you were always a good man of business
jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this
to himself </s>
<s> 

business </s>
<s>  cried the ghost wringing its hands
again </s>
<s>  mankind was my business </s>
<s>  the common
welfare was my business </s>
<s>  charity mercy forbearance
and benevolence were all my business </s>
<s>  the dealings
of my trade were but a drop of water in the
comprehensive ocean of my business </s>
<s> 

it held up its chain at arms length as if that were
the cause of all its unavailing grief and flung it
heavily upon the ground again </s>
<s> 

at this time of the rolling year the spectre said
i suffer most </s>
<s>  why did i walk through crowds of
fellowbeings with my eyes turned down and never
raise them to that blessed star which led the wise
men to a poor abode </s>
<s>  were there no poor homes to
which its light would have conducted me </s>
<s> 

scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the
spectre going on at this rate and began to quake
exceedingly </s>
<s> 

hear me </s>
<s>  cried the ghost </s>
<s>  my time is nearly
gone </s>
<s> 

i will said scrooge </s>
<s>  but dont be hard upon
me </s>
<s>  dont be flowery jacob </s>
<s>  pray </s>
<s> 

how it is that i appear before you in a shape that
you can see i may not tell </s>
<s>  i have sat invisible
beside you many and many a day </s>
<s> 

it was not an agreeable idea </s>
<s>  scrooge shivered
and wiped the perspiration from his brow </s>
<s> 

that is no light part of my penance pursued
the ghost </s>
<s>  i am here tonight to warn you that you
have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate </s>
<s>  a
chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer </s>
<s> 

you were always a good friend to me said
scrooge </s>
<s>  thankee </s>
<s> 

you will be haunted resumed the ghost by
three spirits </s>
<s> 

scrooges countenance fell almost as low as the
ghosts had done </s>
<s> 

is that the chance and hope you mentioned
jacob </s>
<s>  he demanded in a faltering voice </s>
<s> 

it is </s>
<s> 

ii think id rather not said scrooge </s>
<s> 

without their visits said the ghost you cannot
hope to shun the path i tread </s>
<s>  expect the first tomorrow
when the bell tolls one </s>
<s> 

couldnt i take em all at once and have it over
jacob </s>
<s>  hinted scrooge </s>
<s> 

expect the second on the next night at the same
hour </s>
<s>  the third upon the next night when the last
stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate </s>
<s>  look to see
me no more </s>
<s>  and look that for your own sake you
remember what has passed between us </s>
<s> 

when it had said these words the spectre took its
wrapper from the table and bound it round its head
as before </s>
<s>  scrooge knew this by the smart sound its
teeth made when the jaws were brought together
by the bandage </s>
<s>  he ventured to raise his eyes again
and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and
about its arm </s>
<s> 

the apparition walked backward from him </s>
<s>  and at
every step it took the window raised itself a little
so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open </s>
<s> 

it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did </s>
<s> 
when they were within two paces of each other
marleys ghost held up its hand warning him to
come no nearer </s>
<s>  scrooge stopped </s>
<s> 

not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear </s>
<s> 
for on the raising of the hand he became sensible
of confused noises in the air </s>
<s>  incoherent sounds of
lamentation and regret </s>
<s>  wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and
selfaccusatory </s>
<s>  the spectre after listening for a moment
joined in the mournful dirge </s>
<s>  and floated out upon the
bleak dark night </s>
<s> 

scrooge followed to the window </s>
<s>  desperate in his
curiosity </s>
<s>  he looked out </s>
<s> 

the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither
and thither in restless haste and moaning as they
went </s>
<s>  every one of them wore chains like marleys
ghost </s>
<s>  some few they might be guilty governments
were linked together </s>
<s>  none were free </s>
<s>  many had
been personally known to scrooge in their lives </s>
<s>  he
had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white
waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to
its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist
a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below
upon a doorstep </s>
<s>  the misery with them all was
clearly that they sought to interfere for good in
human matters and had lost the power for ever </s>
<s> 

whether these creatures faded into mist or mist
enshrouded them he could not tell </s>
<s>  but they and
their spirit voices faded together </s>
<s>  and the night became
as it had been when he walked home </s>
<s> 

scrooge closed the window and examined the door
by which the ghost had entered </s>
<s>  it was doublelocked
as he had locked it with his own hands and
the bolts were undisturbed </s>
<s>  he tried to say humbug </s>
<s> 
but stopped at the first syllable </s>
<s>  and being
from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues
of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or
the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of
the hour much in need of repose </s>
<s>  went straight to
bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the
instant </s>
<s> 


stave ii </s>
<s>   the first of the three spirits

when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed
he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from
the opaque walls of his chamber </s>
<s>  he was endeavouring to
pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a
neighbouring church struck the four quarters </s>
<s>  so he listened
for the hour </s>
<s> 

to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from
six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to
twelve </s>
<s>  then stopped </s>
<s>  twelve </s>
<s>  it was past two when he
went to bed </s>
<s>  the clock was wrong </s>
<s>  an icicle must have
got into the works </s>
<s>  twelve </s>
<s> 

he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most
preposterous clock </s>
<s>  its rapid little pulse beat twelve </s>
<s> 
and stopped </s>
<s> 

why it isnt possible said scrooge that i can have
slept through a whole day and far into another night </s>
<s>  it
isnt possible that anything has happened to the sun and
this is twelve at noon </s>
<s> 

the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed
and groped his way to the window </s>
<s>  he was obliged to rub
the frost off with the sleeve of his dressinggown before he
could see anything </s>
<s>  and could see very little then </s>
<s>  all he
could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely
cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro
and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been
if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the
world </s>
<s>   this was a great relief because three days after sight
of this first of exchange pay to <abvr> ebenezer scrooge or his
order and so forth would have become a mere united states
security if there were no days to count by </s>
<s> 

scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought
it over and over and over and could make nothing of it </s>
<s>   the more he
thought the more perplexed he was </s>
<s>  and the more he endeavoured
not to think the more he thought </s>
<s> 

marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly </s>
<s>  every time he resolved
within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his
mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first
position and presented the same problem to be worked all through
was it a dream or not </s>
<s> 

scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters
more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned
him of a visitation when the bell tolled one </s>
<s>   he resolved to lie
awake until the hour was passed </s>
<s>  and considering that he could
no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the
wisest resolution in his power </s>
<s> 

the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he
must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock </s>
<s> 
at length it broke upon his listening ear </s>
<s> 

ding dong </s>
<s> 

a quarter past said scrooge counting </s>
<s> 

ding dong </s>
<s> 

halfpast </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

ding dong </s>
<s> 

a quarter to it said scrooge </s>
<s> 

ding dong </s>
<s> 

the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else </s>
<s> 

he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a
deep dull hollow melancholy one </s>
<s>   light flashed up in the room
upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn </s>
<s> 

the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a
hand </s>
<s>  not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his
back but those to which his face was addressed </s>
<s>  the curtains
of his bed were drawn aside </s>
<s>  and scrooge starting up into a
halfrecumbent attitude found himself face to face with the
unearthly visitor who drew them </s>
<s>  as close to it as i am now
to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow </s>
<s> 

it was a strange figurelike a child </s>
<s>  yet not so like a
child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural
medium which gave him the appearance of having receded
from the view and being diminished to a childs proportions </s>
<s> 
its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was
white as if with age </s>
<s>  and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin </s>
<s>  the arms were
very long and muscular </s>
<s>  the hands the same as if its hold
were of uncommon strength </s>
<s>  its legs and feet most delicately
formed were like those upper members bare </s>
<s>  it wore a tunic
of the purest white </s>
<s>  and round its waist was bound
a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful </s>
<s>  it held
a branch of fresh green holly in its hand </s>
<s>  and in singular
contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed
with summer flowers </s>
<s>  but the strangest thing about it was
that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
jet of light by which all this was visible </s>
<s>  and which was
doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a
great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm </s>
<s> 

even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing
steadiness was not its strangest quality </s>
<s>  for as its belt
sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another
and what was light one instant at another time was dark so
the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness </s>
<s>  being now a
thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs
now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a
body </s>
<s>  of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible
in the dense gloom wherein they melted away </s>
<s>  and in the
very wonder of this it would be itself again </s>
<s>  distinct and
clear as ever </s>
<s> 

are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to
me </s>
<s>  asked scrooge </s>
<s> 

i am </s>
<s> 

the voice was soft and gentle </s>
<s>  singularly low as if
instead of being so close beside him it were at a distance </s>
<s> 

who and what are you </s>
<s>  scrooge demanded </s>
<s> 

i am the ghost of christmas past </s>
<s> 

long past </s>
<s>  inquired scrooge </s>
<s>  observant of its dwarfish
stature </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  your past </s>
<s> 

perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if
anybody could have asked him </s>
<s>  but he had a special desire
to see the spirit in his cap </s>
<s>  and begged him to be covered </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out
with worldly hands the light i give </s>
<s>  is it not enough
that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and
force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
my brow </s>
<s> 

scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend
or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at
any period of his life </s>
<s>  he then made bold to inquire what
business brought him there </s>
<s> 

your welfare </s>
<s>  said the ghost </s>
<s> 

scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not
help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been
more conducive to that end </s>
<s>  the spirit must have heard
him thinking for it said immediately </s>
<s> 

your reclamation then </s>
<s>  take heed </s>
<s> 

it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him
gently by the arm </s>
<s> 

rise </s>
<s>  and walk with me </s>
<s> 

it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the
weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes </s>
<s> 
that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below
freezing </s>
<s>  that he was clad but lightly in his slippers
dressinggown and nightcap </s>
<s>  and that he had a cold upon him at
that time </s>
<s>  the grasp though gentle as a womans hand
was not to be resisted </s>
<s>  he rose </s>
<s>  but finding that the spirit
made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication </s>
<s> 

i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall </s>
<s> 

bear but a touch of my hand there said the spirit
laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more
than this </s>
<s> 

as the words were spoken they passed through the wall
and stood upon an open country road with fields on either
hand </s>
<s>  the city had entirely vanished </s>
<s>  not a vestige of it
was to be seen </s>
<s>  the darkness and the mist had vanished
with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon
the ground </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>  said scrooge clasping his hands together
as he looked about him </s>
<s>  i was bred in this place </s>
<s>  i was
a boy here </s>
<s> 

the spirit gazed upon him mildly </s>
<s>  its gentle touch
though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still
present to the old mans sense of feeling </s>
<s>  he was conscious
of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected
with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares
long long forgotten </s>
<s> 

your lip is trembling said the ghost </s>
<s>  and what is
that upon your cheek </s>
<s> 

scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice
that it was a pimple </s>
<s>  and begged the ghost to lead him
where he would </s>
<s> 

you recollect the way </s>
<s>  inquired the spirit </s>
<s> 

remember it </s>
<s>  cried scrooge with fervour </s>
<s>  i could
walk it blindfold </s>
<s> 

strange to have forgotten it for so many years </s>
<s>  observed
the ghost </s>
<s>  let us go on </s>
<s> 

they walked along the road scrooge recognising every
gate and post and tree </s>
<s>  until a little markettown appeared
in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river </s>
<s> 
some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them
with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in
country gigs and carts driven by farmers </s>
<s>  all these boys
were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the
broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air
laughed to hear it </s>
<s> 

these are but shadows of the things that have been said
the ghost </s>
<s>  they have no consciousness of us </s>
<s> 

the jocund travellers came on </s>
<s>  and as they came scrooge
knew and named them every one </s>
<s>  why was he rejoiced beyond
all bounds to see them </s>
<s>  why did his cold eye glisten and
his heart leap up as they went past </s>
<s>  why was he filled
with gladness when he heard them give each other merry
christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for
their several homes </s>
<s>  what was merry christmas to scrooge </s>
<s> 
out upon merry christmas </s>
<s>  what good had it ever done
to him </s>
<s> 

the school is not quite deserted said the ghost </s>
<s>  a
solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still </s>
<s> 

scrooge said he knew it </s>
<s>  and he sobbed </s>
<s> 

they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and
soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little
weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell
hanging in it </s>
<s>  it was a large house but one of broken
fortunes </s>
<s>  for the spacious offices were little used their walls
were damp and mossy their windows broken and their
gates decayed </s>
<s>  fowls clucked and strutted in the stables </s>
<s> 
and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass </s>
<s> 
nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within </s>
<s>  for
entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open
doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished
cold and vast </s>
<s>  there was an earthy savour in the air a
chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow
with too much getting up by candlelight and not too
much to eat </s>
<s> 

they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a
door at the back of the house </s>
<s>  it opened before them and
disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by
lines of plain deal forms and desks </s>
<s>  at one of these a lonely
boy was reading near a feeble fire </s>
<s>  and scrooge sat down
upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he
used to be </s>
<s> 

not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle
from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the
halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among
the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle
swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in
the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening
influence and gave a freer passage to his tears </s>
<s> 

the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his
younger self intent upon his reading </s>
<s>  suddenly a man in
foreign garments </s>
<s>  wonderfully real and distinct to look at </s>
<s> 
stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and
leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood </s>
<s> 

why its ali baba </s>
<s>  scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy </s>
<s>  its
dear old honest ali baba </s>
<s>  yes yes i know </s>
<s>  one christmas
time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone
he did come for the first time just like that </s>
<s>  poor boy </s>
<s>  and
valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson </s>
<s>  there
they go </s>
<s>  and whats his name who was put down in his
drawers asleep at the gate of damascus </s>
<s>  dont you see him </s>
<s> 
and the sultans groom turned upside down by the genii </s>
<s> 
there he is upon his head </s>
<s>  serve him right </s>
<s>  im glad of it </s>
<s> 
what business had he to be married to the princess </s>
<s> 

to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature
on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between
laughing and crying </s>
<s>  and to see his heightened and excited
face </s>
<s>  would have been a surprise to his business friends in
the city indeed </s>
<s> 

theres the parrot </s>
<s>  cried scrooge </s>
<s>  green body and
yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
top of his head </s>
<s>  there he is </s>
<s>  poor robin crusoe he called
him when he came home again after sailing round the
island </s>
<s>  poor robin crusoe where have you been robin
crusoe </s>
<s>   the man thought he was dreaming but he wasnt </s>
<s> 
it was the parrot you know </s>
<s>  there goes friday running
for his life to the little creek </s>
<s>  halloa </s>
<s>  hoop </s>
<s>  halloo </s>
<s> 

then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his
usual character he said in pity for his former self poor
boy </s>
<s>  and cried again </s>
<s> 

i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his
pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his
cuff </s>
<s>  but its too late now </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  asked the spirit </s>
<s> 

nothing said scrooge </s>
<s>  nothing </s>
<s>  there was a boy
singing a christmas carol at my door last night </s>
<s>  i should
like to have given him something </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand </s>
<s> 
saying as it did so let us see another christmas </s>
<s> 

scrooges former self grew larger at the words and the
room became a little darker and more dirty </s>
<s>  the panels shrunk
the windows cracked </s>
<s>  fragments of plaster fell out of the
ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead </s>
<s>  but how
all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you
do </s>
<s>  he only knew that it was quite correct </s>
<s>  that everything
had happened so </s>
<s>  that there he was alone again when all
the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays </s>
<s> 

he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly </s>
<s> 
scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of
his head glanced anxiously towards the door </s>
<s> 

it opened </s>
<s>  and a little girl much younger than the boy
came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and
often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear
brother </s>
<s> 

i have come to bring you home dear brother </s>
<s>  said the

she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his
head </s>

a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master

himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious
condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind

sister into the veriest old well of a shivering bestparlour that
ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial
and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold </s>

block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments
of those dainties to the young people </s>

<s> 

scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind </s>
<s>  and answered briefly
yes </s>
<s> 

although they had but that moment left the school behind
them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city

carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and
tumult of a real city were </s>

the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas
time again </s>

lighted up </s>

the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked
scrooge if he knew it </s>

they went in </s>

wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two

old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the
clock which pointed to the hour of seven </s>

clear away </s>
<s>  there was nothing they wouldnt have cleared

on </s>

<s>  every movable was packed off as if
it were dismissed from public life for evermore </s>
<s>  the floor was
swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon
the fire </s>
<s>  and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and
bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winters
night </s>
<s> 

in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the
lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty
stomachaches </s>

smile </s>

lovable </s>

broke </s>

baker </s>

suspected of not having board enough from his master </s>
<s>  trying
to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who
was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress </s>
<s> 
in they all came one after another </s>
<s>  some shyly some boldly
some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling </s>
<s> 
in they all came anyhow and everyhow </s>

twenty couple at once </s>

the other way </s>

and round in various stages of affectionate grouping </s>

top couple always turning up in the wrong place </s>

couple starting off again as soon as they got there </s>
<s>  all top
couples at last and not a bottom one to help them </s>
<s>  when
this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his
hands to stop the dance cried out well done </s>
<s>  and the
fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially
provided for that purpose </s>
<s>  but scorning rest upon his
reappearance he instantly began again though there were no
dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home
exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man
resolved to beat him out of sight or perish </s>
<s> 

there were more dances and there were forfeits and more
dances and there was cake and there was negus and there
was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece
of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer </s>
<s> 
but the great effect of the evening came after the roast
and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind </s>
<s>  the sort
of man who knew his business better than you or i could
have told it him </s>
<s>  struck up sir roger de coverley </s>
<s>   then
old fezziwig stood out to dance with <abvr> fezziwig </s>
<s>  top
couple too </s>
<s>  with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them </s>
<s> 
three or four and twenty pair of partners </s>
<s>  people who were
not to be trifled with </s>

notion of walking </s>
<s> 

but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold
fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would
mrs </s>
<s>  fezziwig </s>
<s>  as to her she was worthy to be his partner
in every sense of the term </s>
<s>  if thats not high praise tell me
higher and ill use it </s>
<s>  a positive light appeared to issue
from fezziwigs calves </s>
<s>  they shone in every part of the
dance like moons </s>
<s>  you couldnt have predicted at any given
time what would have become of them next </s>
<s>  and when old
fezziwig and <abvr> fezziwig had gone all through the dance </s>
<s> 
advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and
curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to
your place </s>
<s>  fezziwig cutcut so deftly that he appeared
to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without
a stagger </s>
<s> 

when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> fezziwig took their stations one on either side
of the door and shaking hands with every person individually
as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas </s>
<s> 
when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did
the same to them </s>
<s>  and thus the cheerful voices died away
and the lads were left to their beds </s>
<s>  which were under a
counter in the backshop </s>
<s> 

during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a
man out of his wits </s>
<s>  his heart and soul were in the scene
and with his former self </s>
<s>  he corroborated everything
remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent
the strangest agitation </s>
<s>  it was not until now when the
bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from
them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious
that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its
head burnt very clear </s>
<s> 

a small matter said the ghost to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude </s>
<s> 

small </s>
<s>  echoed scrooge </s>
<s> 

the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices
who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig </s>
<s> 
and when he had done so said

why </s>
<s>  is it not </s>
<s>  he has spent but a few pounds of
your mortal money </s>
<s>  three or four perhaps </s>
<s>  is that so
much that he deserves this praise </s>
<s> 

it isnt that said scrooge heated by the remark and
speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self </s>
<s> 
it isnt that spirit </s>
<s>  he has the power to render us happy
or unhappy </s>
<s>  to make our service light or burdensome </s>
<s>  a
pleasure or a toil </s>
<s>  say that his power lies in words and
looks </s>
<s>  in things so slight and insignificant that it is
impossible to add and count em up </s>
<s>  what then </s>
<s>  the happiness
he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune </s>
<s> 

he felt the spirits glance and stopped </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  asked the ghost </s>
<s> 

nothing particular said scrooge </s>
<s> 

something i think </s>
<s>  the ghost insisted </s>
<s> 

no said scrooge no </s>
<s>  i should like to be able to say
a word or two to my clerk just now </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance
to the wish </s>
<s>  and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by
side in the open air </s>
<s> 

my time grows short observed the spirit </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s> 

this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he
could see but it produced an immediate effect </s>
<s>  for again
scrooge saw himself </s>
<s>  he was older now </s>
<s>  a man in the prime
of life </s>
<s>  his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later
years </s>
<s>  but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice </s>
<s> 
there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which
showed the passion that had taken root and where the
shadow of the growing tree would fall </s>
<s> 

he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young
girl in a mourningdress </s>
<s>  in whose eyes there were tears
which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of
christmas past </s>
<s> 

it matters little she said softly </s>
<s>  to you very little </s>
<s> 
another idol has displaced me </s>
<s>  and if it can cheer and comfort
you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have
no just cause to grieve </s>
<s> 

what idol has displaced you </s>
<s>  he rejoined </s>
<s> 

a golden one </s>
<s> 

this is the evenhanded dealing of the world </s>
<s>  he said </s>
<s> 
there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty </s>
<s>  and
there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity
as the pursuit of wealth </s>
<s> 

you fear the world too much she answered gently </s>
<s> 
all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being
beyond the chance of its sordid reproach </s>
<s>  i have seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the masterpassion
gain engrosses you </s>
<s>  have i not </s>
<s> 

what then </s>
<s>  he retorted </s>
<s>  even if i have grown so
much wiser what then </s>
<s>  i am not changed towards you </s>
<s> 

she shook her head </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s> 

our contract is an old one </s>
<s>  it was made when we were
both poor and content to be so until in good season we could
improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry </s>
<s>  you
are changed </s>
<s>  when it was made you were another man </s>
<s> 

i was a boy he said impatiently </s>
<s> 

your own feeling tells you that you were not what you
are she returned </s>
<s>  i am </s>
<s>  that which promised happiness
when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that
we are two </s>
<s>  how often and how keenly i have thought of
this i will not say </s>
<s>  it is enough that i have thought of it
and can release you </s>
<s> 

have i ever sought release </s>
<s> 

in words </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  never </s>
<s> 

in what then </s>
<s> 

in a changed nature </s>
<s>  in an altered spirit </s>
<s>  in another
atmosphere of life </s>
<s>  another hope as its great end </s>
<s>  in
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
sight </s>
<s>  if this had never been between us said the girl
looking mildly but with steadiness upon him </s>
<s>  tell me
would you seek me out and try to win me now </s>
<s>  ah no </s>
<s> 

he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in
spite of himself </s>
<s>  but he said with a struggle you think
not </s>
<s> 

i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered
heaven knows </s>
<s>  when i have learned a truth like this
i know how strong and irresistible it must be </s>
<s>  but if you
were free today tomorrow yesterday can even i believe
that you would choose a dowerless girlyou who in your
very confidence with her weigh everything by gain </s>
<s>  or
choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your
one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your
repentance and regret would surely follow </s>
<s>  i do </s>
<s>  and i
release you </s>
<s>  with a full heart for the love of him you
once were </s>
<s> 

he was about to speak </s>
<s>  but with her head turned from
him she resumed </s>
<s> 

you maythe memory of what is past half makes me
hope you willhave pain in this </s>
<s>  a very very brief time
and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an
unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you
awoke </s>
<s>  may you be happy in the life you have chosen </s>
<s> 

she left him and they parted </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  said scrooge show me no more </s>
<s>  conduct
me home </s>
<s>  why do you delight to torture me </s>
<s> 

one shadow more </s>
<s>  exclaimed the ghost </s>
<s> 

no more </s>
<s>  cried scrooge </s>
<s>  no more </s>
<s>  i dont wish to
see it </s>
<s>  show me no more </s>
<s> 

but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms
and forced him to observe what happened next </s>
<s> 

they were in another scene and place </s>
<s>  a room not very
large or handsome but full of comfort </s>
<s>  near to the winter
fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge
believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely
matron sitting opposite her daughter </s>
<s>  the noise in this
room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children
there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count </s>
<s> 
and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not
forty children conducting themselves like one but every
child was conducting itself like forty </s>
<s>  the consequences
were uproarious beyond belief </s>
<s>  but no one seemed to care </s>
<s> 
on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily
and enjoyed it very much </s>
<s>  and the latter soon beginning to
mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands
most ruthlessly </s>
<s>  what would i not have given to be one of
them </s>
<s>  though i never could have been so rude no no </s>
<s>  i
wouldnt for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
braided hair and torn it down </s>
<s>  and for the precious little
shoe i wouldnt have plucked it off god bless my soul </s>
<s>  to
save my life </s>
<s>  as to measuring her waist in sport as they
did bold young brood i couldnt have done it </s>
<s>  i should
have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment
and never come straight again </s>
<s>  and yet i should
have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips </s>
<s>  to have
questioned her that she might have opened them </s>
<s>  to have
looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never
raised a blush </s>
<s>  to have let loose waves of hair an inch of
which would be a keepsake beyond price </s>
<s>  in short i should
have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence
of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its
value </s>
<s> 

but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a
rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed
and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who
came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys
and presents </s>
<s>  then the shouting and the struggling and
the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter </s>
<s> 
the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his
pockets despoil him of brownpaper parcels hold on tight
by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back
and kick his legs in irrepressible affection </s>
<s>  the shouts of
wonder and delight with which the development of every
package was received </s>
<s>  the terrible announcement that the
baby had been taken in the act of putting a dolls fryingpan
into his mouth and was more than suspected of having
swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter </s>
<s> 
the immense relief of finding this a false alarm </s>
<s>  the joy
and gratitude and ecstasy </s>
<s>  they are all indescribable alike </s>
<s> 
it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions
got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the
top of the house </s>
<s>  where they went to bed and so subsided </s>
<s> 

and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever
when the master of the house having his daughter leaning
fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his
own fireside </s>
<s>  and when he thought that such another
creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might
have called him father and been a springtime in the
haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed </s>
<s> 

belle said the husband turning to his wife with a
smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon </s>
<s> 

who was it </s>
<s> 

guess </s>
<s> 

how can i </s>
<s>  tut dont i know </s>
<s>  she added in the
same breath laughing as he laughed </s>
<s>  <abvr> scrooge </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  scrooge it was </s>
<s>  i passed his office window </s>
<s>  and as
it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could
scarcely help seeing him </s>
<s>  his partner lies upon the point
of death i hear </s>
<s>  and there he sat alone </s>
<s>  quite alone in
the world i do believe </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  said scrooge in a broken voice remove me
from this place </s>
<s> 

i told you these were shadows of the things that have
been said the ghost </s>
<s>  that they are what they are do
not blame me </s>
<s> 

remove me </s>
<s>  scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it </s>
<s> 

he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon
him with a face in which in some strange way there were
fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it </s>
<s> 

leave me </s>
<s>  take me back </s>
<s>  haunt me no longer </s>
<s> 

in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which
the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was
undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed
that its light was burning high and bright </s>
<s>  and dimly
connecting that with its influence over him he seized the
extinguishercap and by a sudden action pressed it down
upon its head </s>
<s> 

the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher
covered its whole form </s>
<s>  but though scrooge pressed it down
with all his force he could not hide the light </s>
<s>  which streamed
from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground </s>
<s> 

he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an
irresistible drowsiness </s>
<s>  and further of being in his own
bedroom </s>
<s>   he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand
relaxed </s>
<s>  and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank
into a heavy sleep </s>
<s> 


stave iii </s>
<s>   the second of the three spirits

awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and
sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had
no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the
stroke of one </s>
<s>  he felt that he was restored to consciousness
in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding
a conference with the second messenger despatched to him
through jacob marleys intervention </s>
<s>  but finding that he
turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which
of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put
them every one aside with his own hands </s>
<s>  and lying down
again established a sharp lookout all round the bed </s>
<s>  for
he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its
appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and
made nervous </s>
<s> 

gentlemen of the freeandeasy sort who plume themselves
on being acquainted with a move or two and being usually
equal to the timeofday express the wide range of their
capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for
anything from pitchandtoss to manslaughter </s>
<s>  between which
opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and
comprehensive range of subjects </s>
<s>  without venturing for
scrooge quite as hardily as this i dont mind calling on you
to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of
strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and
rhinoceros would have astonished him very much </s>
<s> 

now being prepared for almost anything he was not by
any means prepared for nothing </s>
<s>  and consequently when the
bell struck one and no shape appeared he was taken with a
violent fit of trembling </s>
<s>  five minutes ten minutes a quarter
of an hour went by yet nothing came </s>
<s>  all this time he lay
upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy
light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the
hour </s>
<s>  and which being only light was more alarming than
a dozen ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it
meant or would be at </s>
<s>  and was sometimes apprehensive
that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of
spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of
knowing it </s>
<s>  at last however he began to thinkas you or
i would have thought at first </s>
<s>  for it is always the person not
in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done
in it and would unquestionably have done it tooat last i
say he began to think that the source and secret of this
ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence
on further tracing it it seemed to shine </s>
<s>  this idea taking
full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in
his slippers to the door </s>
<s> 

the moment scrooges hand was on the lock a strange
voice called him by his name and bade him enter </s>
<s>  he
obeyed </s>
<s> 

it was his own room </s>
<s>  there was no doubt about that </s>
<s> 
but it had undergone a surprising transformation </s>
<s>  the walls
and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a
perfect grove </s>
<s>  from every part of which bright gleaming
berries glistened </s>
<s>  the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and
ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had
been scattered there </s>
<s>  and such a mighty blaze went roaring
up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had
never known in scrooges time or marleys or for many and
many a winter season gone </s>
<s>  heaped up on the floor to form
a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry brawn
great joints of meat suckingpigs long wreaths of sausages
mincepies plumpuddings barrels of oysters redhot chestnuts
cherrycheeked apples juicy oranges luscious pears
immense twelfthcakes and seething bowls of punch that
made the chamber dim with their delicious steam </s>
<s>  in easy
state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to
see </s>
<s>  who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plentys
horn and held it up high up to shed its light on scrooge
as he came peeping round the door </s>
<s> 

come in </s>
<s>  exclaimed the ghost </s>
<s>  come in </s>
<s>  and know
me better man </s>
<s> 

scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this
spirit </s>
<s>  he was not the dogged scrooge he had been </s>
<s>  and
though the spirits eyes were clear and kind he did not like
to meet them </s>
<s> 

i am the ghost of christmas present said the spirit </s>
<s> 
look upon me </s>
<s> 

scrooge reverently did so </s>
<s>  it was clothed in one simple
green robe or mantle bordered with white fur </s>
<s>  this garment
hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was
bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any
artifice </s>
<s>  its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the
garment were also bare </s>
<s>  and on its head it wore no other
covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining
icicles </s>
<s>  its dark brown curls were long and free </s>
<s>  free as its
genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice
its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air </s>

round its middle was an antique scabbard </s>
<s>  but no sword

the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood
in the city streets on christmas morning where for the
weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk and
not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the
pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of
their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see
it come plumping down into the road below and splitting
into artificial little snowstorms </s>

the house fronts looked black enough and the windows
blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow

streets branched off </s>

fruiterers were radiant in their glory </s>

potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats

into the street in their apoplectic opulence </s>
<s>  there were
ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish onions shining in
the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking
from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went
by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe </s>

pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids </s>

counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller

up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended
scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even
that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so
extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight
the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and
spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookerson
feel faint and subsequently bilious </s>
<s>  nor was it that the figs
were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in
modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that
everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress </s>
<s>  but
the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful
promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other
at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left
their purchases upon the counter and came running back to
fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in
the best humour possible </s>
<s>  while the grocer and his people
were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which
they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own

but soon the steeples called good people all to church and
chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in
their best clothes and with their gayest faces </s>
<s>  and at the
same time there emerged from scores of byestreets lanes and
nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners
to the bakers shops </s>
<s>  the sight of these poor revellers
appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with
scrooge beside him in a bakers doorway and taking off the
covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their
dinners from his torch </s>
<s>  and it was a very uncommon kind
of torch for once or twice when there were angry words

scrooge promised that he would </s>
<s>  and they went on
invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the
town </s>
<s>  it was a remarkable quality of the ghost which
scrooge had observed at the bakers that notwithstanding
his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place
with ease </s>
<s>  and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall </s>
<s> 

and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in
showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind
generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor
men that led him straight to scrooges clerks </s>
<s>  for there he
went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe </s>
<s>  and
on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped
to bless bob cratchits dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch </s>

<s>  bob had but fifteen bob aweek
himself </s>

martha didnt like to see him disappointed if it were only

door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits
hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the washhouse

hugged his daughter to his hearts content </s>

as good as gold said bob and better </s>

gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the

<s> 

bobs voice was tremulous when he told them this and
trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing
strong and hearty </s>

his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back
came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by
his brother and sister to his stool before the fire </s>

bob turning up his cuffsas if poor fellow they were
capable of being made more shabbycompounded some hot
mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round

goose with which they soon returned in high procession </s>

long expected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of
delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim

there never was such a goose </s>

too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by

at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the

fire </s>

at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass </s>

two tumblers and a custardcup without a handle </s>

he sat very close to his fathers side upon his little
stool </s>

what then </s>

scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by
the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief </s>

five minutes </s>

<s>  bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for master peter which would bring in if obtained full
fiveandsixpence weekly </s>
<s>  the two young cratchits laughed
tremendously at the idea of peters being a man of business </s>
<s> 
and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt
of that bewildering income </s>
<s>  martha who was a poor
apprentice at a milliners then told them what kind of work
she had to do and how many hours she worked at a stretch

good long rest </s>

home </s>
<s>  also how she had seen a countess and a lord some
days before and how the lord was much about as tall as
peter </s>
<s>  at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you
couldnt have seen his head if you had been there </s>
<s>  all this
time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round </s>
<s>  and
byandbye they had a song about a lost child travelling in
the snow from tiny tim who had a plaintive little voice
and sang it very well indeed </s>
<s> 

there was nothing of high mark in this </s>
<s>  they were not
a handsome family </s>
<s>  they were not well dressed </s>
<s>  their shoes
were far from being waterproof </s>
<s>  their clothes were scanty </s>
<s> 
and peter might have known and very likely did the inside
of a pawnbrokers </s>
<s>  but they were happy grateful pleased
with one another and contented with the time </s>
<s>  and when
they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings
of the spirits torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon
them and especially on tiny tim until the last </s>
<s> 

by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty
heavily </s>
<s>  and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets
the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and
all sorts of rooms was wonderful </s>
<s>  here the flickering of
the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot
plates baking through and through before the fire and deep
red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness </s>
<s> 
there all the children of the house were running out
into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins
uncles aunts and be the first to greet them </s>
<s>  here again
were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling </s>
<s>  and
there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted
and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near
neighbours house </s>
<s>  where woe upon the single man who saw
them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow </s>
<s> 

but if you had judged from the numbers of people on
their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought
that no one was at home to give them welcome when they
got there instead of every house expecting company and
piling up its fires halfchimney high </s>
<s>  blessings on it how
the ghost exulted </s>
<s>  how it bared its breadth of breast and
opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with
a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything
within its reach </s>
<s>  the very lamplighter who ran on before
dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was
dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly
as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter
that he had any company but christmas </s>
<s> 

and now without a word of warning from the ghost they
stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses
of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace
of giants </s>
<s>  and water spread itself wheresoever it listed
or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner </s>
<s> 
and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass </s>
<s> 
down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery
red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a
sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in
the thick gloom of darkest night </s>
<s> 

what place is this </s>
<s>  asked scrooge </s>
<s> 

a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of
the earth returned the spirit </s>
<s>  but they know me </s>
<s>  see </s>
<s> 

a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they
advanced towards it </s>
<s>  passing through the wall of mud and
stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a
glowing fire </s>
<s>  an old old man and woman with their
children and their childrens children and another generation
beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire </s>
<s> 
the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling
of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a
christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a
boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus </s>
<s> 
so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite
blithe and loud </s>
<s>  and so surely as they stopped his vigour
sank again </s>
<s> 

the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his
robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither </s>
<s>  not
to sea </s>
<s>  to sea </s>
<s>  to scrooges horror looking back he saw
the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them </s>
<s> 
and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it
rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it
had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth </s>
<s> 

built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league
or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed
the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse </s>
<s> 
great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirds
born of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the
waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed </s>
<s> 

but even here two men who watched the light had made
a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed
out a ray of brightness on the awful sea </s>
<s>  joining their
horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they
wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog </s>
<s>  and
one of them </s>
<s>  the elder too with his face all damaged and
scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship
might be </s>
<s>  struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in
itself </s>
<s> 

again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea
on onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any
shore they lighted on a ship </s>
<s>  they stood beside the helmsman
at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who
had the watch </s>
<s>  dark ghostly figures in their several stations </s>
<s> 
but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or
had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his
companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward
hopes belonging to it </s>
<s>  and every man on board waking or
sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another
on that day than on any day in the year </s>
<s>  and had shared
to some extent in its festivities </s>
<s>  and had remembered those
he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted
to remember him </s>

it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the
moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it
was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown
abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death </s>

was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear
a hearty laugh </s>

oh perfectly satisfactory </s>
<s> 

hes a comical old fellow said scrooges nephew thats
the truth </s>
<s>  and not so pleasant as he might be </s>
<s>  however
his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing
to say against him </s>
<s> 

im sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooges niece </s>
<s> 
at least you always tell me so </s>
<s> 

what of that my dear </s>
<s>  said scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  his
wealth is of no use to him </s>
<s>  he dont do any good with it </s>
<s> 
he dont make himself comfortable with it </s>
<s>  he hasnt the
satisfaction of thinkingha ha ha </s>
<s> that he is ever going
to benefit us with it </s>
<s> 

i have no patience with him observed scrooges niece </s>
<s> 
scrooges nieces sisters and all the other ladies expressed
the same opinion </s>
<s> 

oh i have </s>
<s>  said scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  i am sorry for
him </s>
<s>  i couldnt be angry with him if i tried </s>
<s>  who suffers
by his ill whims </s>
<s>  himself always </s>
<s>  here he takes it into
his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine with us </s>
<s> 
whats the consequence </s>
<s>  he dont lose much of a dinner </s>
<s> 

indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted
scrooges niece </s>
<s>  everybody else said the same and they
must be allowed to have been competent judges because
they had just had dinner </s>
<s>  and with the dessert upon the
table were clustered round the fire by lamplight </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  im very glad to hear it said scrooges nephew
because i havent great faith in these young housekeepers </s>
<s> 
what do you say topper </s>
<s> 

topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooges nieces
sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast
who had no right to express an opinion on the subject </s>
<s> 
whereat scrooges nieces sisterthe plump one with the lace
tucker </s>
<s>  not the one with the rosesblushed </s>
<s> 

do go on fred said scrooges niece clapping her hands </s>
<s> 
he never finishes what he begins to say </s>
<s>  he is such a
ridiculous fellow </s>
<s> 

scrooges nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was
impossible to keep the infection off </s>
<s>  though the plump sister
tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar </s>
<s>  his example was
unanimously followed </s>
<s> 

i was only going to say said scrooges nephew that
the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making
merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant
moments which could do him no harm </s>
<s>  i am sure he loses
pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts
either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers </s>
<s>  i
mean to give him the same chance every year whether he
likes it or not for i pity him </s>
<s>  he may rail at christmas
till he dies but he cant help thinking better of iti defy
himif he finds me going there in good temper year after
year and saying uncle scrooge how are you </s>
<s>  if it only
puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds
thats something </s>
<s>  and i think i shook him yesterday </s>
<s> 

it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking
scrooge </s>
<s>  but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much
caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any
rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the
bottle joyously </s>
<s> 

after tea they had some music </s>
<s>  for they were a musical
family and knew what they were about when they sung a
glee or catch i can assure you </s>
<s>  especially topper who
could growl away in the bass like a good one and never
swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face
over it </s>
<s>  scrooges niece played well upon the harp </s>
<s>  and
played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing </s>
<s> 
you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had
been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the
boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of
christmas past </s>
<s>  when this strain of music sounded all the
things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind </s>
<s>  he
softened more and more </s>
<s>  and thought that if he could have
listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the
kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands
without resorting to the sextons spade that buried jacob
marley </s>
<s> 

but they didnt devote the whole evening to music </s>
<s>  after
a while they played at forfeits </s>
<s>  for it is good to be children
sometimes and never better than at christmas when its
mighty founder was a child himself </s>
<s>  stop </s>
<s>  there was first
a game at blindmans buff </s>
<s>  of course there was </s>
<s>  and i
no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he
had eyes in his boots </s>
<s>  my opinion is that it was a done
thing between him and scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  and that the
ghost of christmas present knew it </s>
<s>  the way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature </s>
<s>  knocking down the fireirons
tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano
smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went
there went he </s>
<s>  he always knew where the plump sister was </s>
<s> 
he wouldnt catch anybody else </s>
<s>  if you had fallen up
against him as some of them did on purpose he would
have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would
have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly
have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister </s>
<s> 
she often cried out that it wasnt fair </s>
<s>  and it really was not </s>
<s> 
but when at last he caught her </s>
<s>  when in spite of all her
silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got
her into a corner whence there was no escape </s>
<s>  then his
conduct was the most execrable </s>
<s>  for his pretending not to
know her </s>
<s>  his pretending that it was necessary to touch her
headdress and further to assure himself of her identity by
pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain
about her neck </s>
<s>  was vile monstrous </s>
<s>  no doubt she told
him her opinion of it when another blindman being in
office they were so very confidential together behind the
curtains </s>
<s> 

scrooges niece was not one of the blindmans buff party
but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool
in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close
behind her </s>
<s>  but she joined in the forfeits and loved her
love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet </s>
<s> 
likewise at the game of how when and where she was
very great and to the secret joy of scrooges nephew beat
her sisters hollow </s>
<s>  though they were sharp girls too as topper
could have told you </s>
<s>  there might have been twenty people there
young and old but they all played and so did scrooge </s>
<s>  for
wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that
his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with
his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too </s>
<s> 
for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut
in the eye was not sharper than scrooge </s>
<s>  blunt as he took it in
his head to be </s>
<s> 

the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood
and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like
a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed </s>
<s>  but
this the spirit said could not be done </s>
<s> 

here is a new game said scrooge </s>
<s>  one half hour
spirit only one </s>
<s> 

it was a game called yes and no where scrooges nephew
had to think of something and the rest must find out what </s>
<s> 
he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case
was </s>
<s>  the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed
elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live
animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an
animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes
and lived in london and walked about the streets
and wasnt made a show of and wasnt led by anybody and
didnt live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market
and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a
tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear </s>
<s>  at every fresh
question that was put to him this nephew burst into a
fresh roar of laughter </s>
<s>  and was so inexpressibly tickled that
he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp </s>
<s>  at last
the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out </s>
<s> 

i have found it out </s>
<s>  i know what it is fred </s>
<s>  i know
what it is </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  cried fred </s>
<s> 

its your uncle scroooooge </s>
<s> 

which it certainly was </s>
<s>  admiration was the universal
sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it a
bear </s>
<s>  ought to have been yes </s>
<s>  inasmuch as an answer
in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts
from <abvr> scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency
that way </s>
<s> 

he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said
fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health </s>
<s> 
here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the
moment </s>
<s>  and i say uncle scrooge </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  uncle scrooge </s>
<s>  they cried </s>
<s> 

a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old
man whatever he is </s>
<s>  said scrooges nephew </s>
<s>  he wouldnt
take it from me but may he have it nevertheless </s>
<s>  uncle
scrooge </s>
<s> 

uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light
of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious
company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech
if the ghost had given him time </s>
<s>  but the whole scene
passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his
nephew </s>
<s>  and he and the spirit were again upon their travels </s>
<s> 

much they saw and far they went and many homes they
visited but always with a happy end </s>
<s>  the spirit stood
beside sick beds and they were cheerful </s>
<s>  on foreign lands
and they were close at home </s>
<s>  by struggling men and they
were patient in their greater hope </s>
<s>  by poverty and it was
rich </s>
<s>  in almshouse hospital and jail in miserys every
refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not
made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his
blessing and taught scrooge his precepts </s>
<s> 

it was a long night if it were only a night </s>
<s>  but scrooge
had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared
to be condensed into the space of time they passed
together </s>
<s>  it was strange too that while scrooge remained
unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly
older </s>
<s>  scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of
it until they left a childrens twelfth night party when
looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place
he noticed that its hair was grey </s>
<s> 

are spirits lives so short </s>
<s>  asked scrooge </s>
<s> 

my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost </s>
<s> 
it ends tonight </s>
<s> 

tonight </s>
<s>  cried scrooge </s>
<s> 

tonight at midnight </s>
<s>  hark </s>
<s>  the time is drawing
near </s>
<s> 

the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at
that moment </s>
<s> 

forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said
scrooge looking intently at the spirits robe but i see
something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding
from your skirts </s>
<s>  is it a foot or a claw </s>
<s> 

it might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it was
the spirits sorrowful reply </s>
<s>  look here </s>
<s> 

from the foldings of its robe it brought two children </s>
<s> 
wretched abject frightful hideous miserable </s>
<s>  they knelt
down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment </s>
<s> 

oh man </s>
<s>  look here </s>
<s>  look look down here </s>
<s>  exclaimed
the ghost </s>
<s> 

they were a boy and girl </s>
<s>  yellow meagre ragged scowling
wolfish </s>
<s>  but prostrate too in their humility </s>
<s>  where
graceful youth should have filled their features out and
touched them with its freshest tints a stale and shrivelled
hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and
pulled them into shreds </s>
<s>  where angels might have sat
enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing </s>
<s>  no
change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any
grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has
monsters half so horrible and dread </s>
<s> 

scrooge started back appalled </s>
<s>  having them shown to
him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but
the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie
of such enormous magnitude </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  are they yours </s>
<s>  scrooge could say no more </s>
<s> 

they are mans said the spirit looking down upon
them </s>
<s>  and they cling to me appealing from their fathers </s>
<s> 
this boy is ignorance </s>
<s>  this girl is want </s>
<s>  beware them both
and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for
on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the
writing be erased </s>
<s>  deny it </s>
<s>  cried the spirit stretching out
its hand towards the city </s>
<s>  slander those who tell it ye </s>
<s> 
admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse </s>
<s> 
and bide the end </s>
<s> 

have they no refuge or resource </s>
<s>  cried scrooge </s>
<s> 

are there no prisons </s>
<s>  said the spirit turning on him
for the last time with his own words </s>
<s>  are there no workhouses </s>
<s> 

the bell struck twelve </s>
<s> 

scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not </s>
<s> 
as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the
prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes
beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like
a mist along the ground towards him </s>
<s> 


stave iv </s>
<s>   the last of the spirits

the phantom slowly gravely silently approached </s>
<s>  when
it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee </s>
<s>  for in
the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to
scatter gloom and mystery </s>
<s> 

it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed
its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible
save one outstretched hand </s>
<s>  but for this it would have been
difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it
from the darkness by which it was surrounded </s>
<s> 

he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside
him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a
solemn dread </s>
<s>  he knew no more for the spirit neither
spoke nor moved </s>
<s> 

i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to
come </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s> 

the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its
hand </s>
<s> 

you are about to show me shadows of the things that
have not happened but will happen in the time before us
scrooge pursued </s>
<s>  is that so spirit </s>
<s> 

the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
instant in its folds as if the spirit had inclined its head </s>
<s> 
that was the only answer he received </s>
<s> 

although well used to ghostly company by this time
scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled
beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when
he prepared to follow it </s>
<s>  the spirit paused a moment as
observing his condition and giving him time to recover </s>
<s> 

but scrooge was all the worse for this </s>
<s>  it thrilled him
with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the
dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost
could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
of black </s>
<s> 

ghost of the future </s>
<s>  he exclaimed i fear you more
than any spectre i have seen </s>
<s>  but as i know your purpose
is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another
man from what i was i am prepared to bear you company
and do it with a thankful heart </s>
<s>  will you not speak
to me </s>
<s> 

it gave him no reply </s>
<s>  the hand was pointed straight
before them </s>
<s> 

lead on </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s>  lead on </s>
<s>  the night is
waning fast and it is precious time to me i know </s>
<s>  lead
on spirit </s>
<s> 

the phantom moved away as it had come towards him </s>
<s> 
scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him
up he thought and carried him along </s>
<s> 

they scarcely seemed to enter the city </s>
<s>  for the city rather
seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its
own act </s>
<s>  but there they were in the heart of it </s>
<s>  on
change amongst the merchants </s>
<s>  who hurried up and down
and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in
groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully
with their great gold seals </s>
<s>  and so forth as scrooge had
seen them often </s>
<s> 

the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men </s>
<s> 
observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge
advanced to listen to their talk </s>
<s> 

no said a great fat man with a monstrous chin i
dont know much about it either way </s>
<s>  i only know hes
dead </s>
<s> 

when did he die </s>
<s>  inquired another </s>
<s> 

last night i believe </s>
<s> 

why what was the matter with him </s>
<s>  asked a third
taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuffbox </s>
<s> 
i thought hed never die </s>
<s> 

god knows said the first with a yawn </s>
<s> 

what has he done with his money </s>
<s>  asked a redfaced
gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his
nose that shook like the gills of a turkeycock </s>
<s> 

i havent heard said the man with the large chin
yawning again </s>
<s>  left it to his company perhaps </s>
<s>  he hasnt
left it to me </s>
<s>  thats all i know </s>
<s> 

this pleasantry was received with a general laugh </s>
<s> 

its likely to be a very cheap funeral said the same
speaker </s>
<s>  for upon my life i dont know of anybody to go
to it </s>
<s>  suppose we make up a party and volunteer </s>
<s> 

i dont mind going if a lunch is provided observed the
gentleman with the excrescence on his nose </s>
<s>  but i must
be fed if i make one </s>
<s> 

another laugh </s>
<s> 

well i am the most disinterested among you after all
said the first speaker for i never wear black gloves and i
never eat lunch </s>
<s>  but ill offer to go if anybody else will </s>
<s> 
when i come to think of it im not at all sure that i wasnt
his most particular friend </s>
<s>  for we used to stop and speak
whenever we met </s>
<s>  bye bye </s>
<s> 

speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with
other groups </s>
<s>  scrooge knew the men and looked towards the
spirit for an explanation </s>
<s> 

the phantom glided on into a street </s>
<s>  its finger pointed
to two persons meeting </s>
<s>  scrooge listened again thinking
that the explanation might lie here </s>
<s> 

he knew these men also perfectly </s>
<s>  they were men of business </s>
<s> 
very wealthy and of great importance </s>
<s>  he had made a point
always of standing well in their esteem </s>
<s>  in a business point
of view that is </s>
<s>  strictly in a business point of view </s>
<s> 

how are you </s>
<s>  said one </s>
<s> 

how are you </s>
<s>  returned the other </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the first </s>
<s>  old scratch has got his own at
last hey </s>
<s> 

so i am told returned the second </s>
<s>  cold isnt it </s>
<s> 

seasonable for christmas time </s>
<s>  youre not a skater i
suppose </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  something else to think of </s>
<s>  good morning </s>
<s> 

not another word </s>
<s>  that was their meeting their
conversation and their parting </s>
<s> 

scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the
spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so
trivial </s>
<s>  but feeling assured that they must have some hidden
purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be </s>
<s> 
they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the
death of jacob his old partner for that was past and this
ghosts province was the future </s>
<s>  nor could he think of any
one immediately connected with himself to whom he could
apply them </s>
<s>  but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they
applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement
he resolved to treasure up every word he heard
and everything he saw </s>
<s>  and especially to observe the
shadow of himself when it appeared </s>
<s>  for he had an expectation
that the conduct of his future self would give him
the clue he missed and would render the solution of these
riddles easy </s>
<s> 

he looked about in that very place for his own image </s>
<s>  but
another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the
clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there he
saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured
in through the porch </s>
<s>  it gave him little surprise however </s>
<s> 
for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and
thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried
out in this </s>
<s> 

quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its
outstretched hand </s>
<s>  when he roused himself from his
thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and
its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes
were looking at him keenly </s>
<s>  it made him shudder and feel
very cold </s>
<s> 

they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part
of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before
although he recognised its situation and its bad repute </s>
<s>  the
ways were foul and narrow </s>
<s>  the shops and houses wretched </s>
<s> 
the people halfnaked drunken slipshod ugly </s>
<s>  alleys and
archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of
smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets </s>
<s>  and the
whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery </s>
<s> 

far in this den of infamous resort there was a lowbrowed
beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron old rags
bottles bones and greasy offal were bought </s>
<s>  upon the floor
within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges
files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds </s>
<s>  secrets
that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in
mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and
sepulchres of bones </s>
<s>  sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a
charcoal stove made of old bricks was a greyhaired rascal
nearly seventy years of age </s>
<s>  who had screened himself from the
cold air without by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous
tatters hung upon a line </s>
<s>  and smoked his pipe in all the luxury
of calm retirement </s>
<s> 

scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this
man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the
shop </s>
<s>  but she had scarcely entered when another woman
similarly laden came in too </s>
<s>  and she was closely followed by
a man in faded black who was no less startled by the sight
of them than they had been upon the recognition of each
other </s>
<s>  after a short period of blank astonishment in which
the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three
burst into a laugh </s>
<s> 

let the charwoman alone to be the first </s>
<s>  cried she who
had entered first </s>
<s>  let the laundress alone to be the second </s>
<s> 
and let the undertakers man alone to be the third </s>
<s>  look
here old joe heres a chance </s>
<s>  if we havent all three met
here without meaning it </s>
<s> 

you couldnt have met in a better place said old joe
removing his pipe from his mouth </s>
<s>  come into the parlour </s>
<s> 
you were made free of it long ago you know </s>
<s>  and the other
two ant strangers </s>
<s>  stop till i shut the door of the shop </s>
<s> 
ah </s>
<s>  how it skreeks </s>
<s>  there ant such a rusty bit of metal
in the place as its own hinges i believe </s>
<s>  and im sure theres
no such old bones here as mine </s>
<s>  ha ha </s>
<s>  were all suitable
to our calling were well matched </s>
<s>  come into the
parlour </s>
<s>  come into the parlour </s>
<s> 

the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags </s>
<s>  the
old man raked the fire together with an old stairrod and
having trimmed his smoky lamp for it was night with the
stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again </s>
<s> 

while he did this the woman who had already spoken
threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting
manner on a stool </s>
<s>  crossing her elbows on her knees and
looking with a bold defiance at the other two </s>
<s> 

what odds then </s>
<s>  what odds <abvr> dilber </s>
<s>  said the
woman </s>
<s>  every person has a right to take care of themselves </s>
<s> 
he always did </s>
<s> 

thats true indeed </s>
<s>  said the laundress </s>
<s>  no man
more so </s>
<s> 

why then dont stand staring as if you was afraid
woman </s>
<s>  whos the wiser </s>
<s>  were not going to pick holes in
each others coats i suppose </s>
<s> 

no indeed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> dilber and the man together </s>
<s> 
we should hope not </s>
<s> 

very well then </s>
<s>  cried the woman </s>
<s>  thats enough </s>
<s> 
whos the worse for the loss of a few things like these </s>
<s> 
not a dead man i suppose </s>
<s> 

no indeed said <abvr> dilber laughing </s>
<s> 

if he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old
screw pursued the woman why wasnt he natural in his
lifetime </s>
<s>  if he had been hed have had somebody to look
after him when he was struck with death instead of lying
gasping out his last there alone by himself </s>
<s> 

its the truest word that ever was spoke said <abvr>
dilber </s>
<s>  its a judgment on him </s>
<s> 

i wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the
woman </s>
<s>  and it should have been you may depend upon it
if i could have laid my hands on anything else </s>
<s>  open that
bundle old joe and let me know the value of it </s>
<s>  speak out
plain </s>
<s>  im not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to
see it </s>
<s>  we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves
before we met here i believe </s>
<s>  its no sin </s>
<s>  open the bundle
joe </s>
<s> 

but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this </s>
<s> 
and the man in faded black mounting the breach first
produced his plunder </s>
<s>  it was not extensive </s>
<s>  a seal or two
a pencilcase a pair of sleevebuttons and a brooch of no
great value were all </s>
<s>  they were severally examined and
appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed
to give for each upon the wall and added them up into a
total when he found there was nothing more to come </s>
<s> 

thats your account said joe and i wouldnt give
another sixpence if i was to be boiled for not doing it </s>
<s> 
whos next </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dilber was next </s>
<s>  sheets and towels a little wearing
apparel two oldfashioned silver teaspoons a pair of
sugartongs and a few boots </s>
<s>  her account was stated on the wall
in the same manner </s>
<s> 

i always give too much to ladies </s>
<s>  its a weakness of mine
and thats the way i ruin myself said old joe </s>
<s>  thats
your account </s>
<s>  if you asked me for another penny and made
it an open question id repent of being so liberal and knock
off halfacrown </s>
<s> 

and now undo my bundle joe said the first woman </s>
<s> 

joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience
of opening it and having unfastened a great many knots
dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff </s>
<s> 

what do you call this </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  bedcurtains </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  returned the woman laughing and leaning forward
on her crossed arms </s>
<s>  bedcurtains </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to say you took em down rings and
all with him lying there </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s> 

yes i do replied the woman </s>
<s>  why not </s>
<s> 

you were born to make your fortune said joe and
youll certainly do it </s>
<s> 

i certainly shant hold my hand when i can get anything

his blankets </s>
<s>  asked joe </s>
<s> 

whose elses do you think </s>
<s>  replied the woman </s>
<s>  he
isnt likely to take cold without em i dare say </s>
<s> 

i hope he didnt die of anything catching </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s>  said
old joe stopping in his work and looking up </s>
<s> 

dont you be afraid of that returned the woman </s>
<s>  i
ant so fond of his company that id loiter about him for
such things if he did </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  you may look through that
shirt till your eyes ache </s>
<s>  but you wont find a hole in it nor
a threadbare place </s>
<s>  its the best he had and a fine one too </s>
<s> 
theyd have wasted it if it hadnt been for me </s>
<s> 

what do you call wasting of it </s>
<s>  asked old joe </s>
<s> 

putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied
the woman with a laugh </s>
<s>  somebody was fool enough to
do it but i took it off again </s>
<s>  if calico ant good enough for
such a purpose it isnt good enough for anything </s>
<s>  its quite
as becoming to the body </s>
<s>  he cant look uglier than he did
in that one </s>
<s> 

scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror </s>
<s>  as they sat
grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by
the old mans lamp he viewed them with a detestation and
disgust which could hardly have been greater though they
had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself </s>
<s> 

ha ha </s>
<s>  laughed the same woman when old joe
producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their
several gains upon the ground </s>
<s>  this is the end of it you
see </s>
<s>  he frightened every one away from him when he was
alive to profit us when he was dead </s>
<s>  ha ha ha </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  said scrooge shuddering from head to foot </s>
<s>  i
see i see </s>
<s>  the case of this unhappy man might be my own </s>
<s> 
my life tends that way now </s>
<s>  merciful heaven what is
this </s>
<s> 

he recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now
he almost touched a bed </s>
<s>  a bare uncurtained bed </s>
<s>  on which
beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up
which though it was dumb announced itself in awful
language </s>
<s> 

the room was very dark too dark to be observed with
any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience
to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it
was </s>
<s>  a pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon
the bed </s>
<s>  and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept
uncared for was the body of this man </s>
<s> 

scrooge glanced towards the phantom </s>
<s>  its steady hand
was pointed to the head </s>
<s>  the cover was so carelessly adjusted
that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon
scrooges part would have disclosed the face </s>
<s>  he thought
of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it </s>
<s> 
but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss
the spectre at his side </s>
<s> 

oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar
here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy
command </s>
<s>  for this is thy dominion </s>
<s>  but of the loved
revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair
to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious </s>
<s>  it is
not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released </s>
<s> 
it is not that the heart and pulse are still </s>
<s>  but that the
hand was open generous and true </s>
<s>  the heart brave warm
and tender </s>
<s>  and the pulse a mans </s>
<s>  strike shadow strike </s>
<s> 
and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow
the world with life immortal </s>
<s> 

no voice pronounced these words in scrooges ears and
yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed </s>
<s>  he
thought if this man could be raised up now what would be
his foremost thoughts </s>
<s>  avarice harddealing griping cares </s>
<s> 
they have brought him to a rich end truly </s>
<s> 

he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a
woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this
or that and for the memory of one kind word i will be
kind to him </s>
<s>  a cat was tearing at the door and there was
a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone </s>
<s>  what
they wanted in the room of death and why they were so
restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  he said this is a fearful place </s>
<s>  in leaving it
i shall not leave its lesson trust me </s>
<s>  let us go </s>
<s> 

still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the
head </s>
<s> 

i understand you scrooge returned and i would do
it if i could </s>
<s>  but i have not the power spirit </s>
<s>  i have
not the power </s>
<s> 

again it seemed to look upon him </s>
<s> 

if there is any person in the town who feels emotion
caused by this mans death said scrooge quite agonised
show that person to me spirit i beseech you </s>
<s> 

the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a
moment like a wing </s>
<s>  and withdrawing it revealed a room
by daylight where a mother and her children were </s>
<s> 

she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness </s>
<s> 
for she walked up and down the room </s>
<s>  started at every
sound </s>
<s>  looked out from the window </s>
<s>  glanced at the clock </s>
<s> 
tried but in vain to work with her needle </s>
<s>  and could hardly
bear the voices of the children in their play </s>
<s> 

at length the longexpected knock was heard </s>
<s>  she hurried
to the door and met her husband </s>
<s>  a man whose face was
careworn and depressed though he was young </s>
<s>  there was
a remarkable expression in it now </s>
<s>  a kind of serious delight
of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress </s>
<s> 

he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for
him by the fire </s>
<s>  and when she asked him faintly what news
which was not until after a long silence he appeared
embarrassed how to answer </s>
<s> 

is it good </s>
<s>  she said or bad </s>
<s> to help him </s>
<s> 

bad he answered </s>
<s> 

we are quite ruined </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  there is hope yet caroline </s>
<s> 

if he relents she said amazed there is </s>
<s>  nothing is
past hope if such a miracle has happened </s>
<s> 

he is past relenting said her husband </s>
<s>  he is dead </s>
<s> 

she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke
truth </s>
<s>  but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she
said so with clasped hands </s>
<s>  she prayed forgiveness the next
moment and was sorry </s>
<s>  but the first was the emotion of
her heart </s>
<s> 

what the halfdrunken woman whom i told you of last
night said to me when i tried to see him and obtain a
weeks delay </s>
<s>  and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid
me </s>
<s>  turns out to have been quite true </s>
<s>  he was not only
very ill but dying then </s>
<s> 

to whom will our debt be transferred </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s>  but before that time we shall be ready
with the money </s>
<s>  and even though we were not it would be
a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his
successor </s>
<s>  we may sleep tonight with light hearts caroline </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  soften it as they would their hearts were lighter </s>
<s> 
the childrens faces hushed and clustered round to hear what
they so little understood were brighter </s>
<s>  and it was a happier
house for this mans death </s>
<s>  the only emotion that the
ghost could show him caused by the event was one of
pleasure </s>
<s> 

let me see some tenderness connected with a death said
scrooge </s>
<s>  or that dark chamber spirit which we left just
now will be for ever present to me </s>
<s> 

the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet </s>
<s>  and as they went along scrooge looked here and
there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen </s>
<s>  they
entered poor bob cratchits house </s>
<s>  the dwelling he had
visited before </s>
<s>  and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire </s>
<s> 

quiet </s>
<s>  very quiet </s>
<s>  the noisy little cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter
who had a book before him </s>
<s>  the mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing </s>
<s>  but surely they were very quiet </s>
<s> 

and he took a child and set him in the midst of
them </s>
<s> 

where had scrooge heard those words </s>
<s>  he had not
dreamed them </s>
<s>  the boy must have read them out as he
and the spirit crossed the threshold </s>
<s>  why did he not
go on </s>
<s> 

the mother laid her work upon the table and put her
hand up to her face </s>
<s> 

the colour hurts my eyes she said </s>
<s> 

the colour </s>
<s>  ah poor tiny tim </s>
<s> 

theyre better now again said cratchits wife </s>
<s>  it
makes them weak by candlelight </s>
<s>  and i wouldnt show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home for the world </s>
<s>  it
must be near his time </s>
<s> 

past it rather peter answered shutting up his book </s>
<s> 
but i think he has walked a little slower than he used
these few last evenings mother </s>
<s> 

they were very quiet again </s>
<s>  at last she said and in a
steady cheerful voice that only faltered once </s>
<s> 

i have known him walk withi have known him walk
with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed </s>
<s> 

and so have i cried peter </s>
<s>  often </s>
<s> 

and so have i exclaimed another </s>
<s>  so had all </s>
<s> 

but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon
her work and his father loved him so that it was no
trouble </s>
<s>  no trouble </s>
<s>  and there is your father at the door </s>
<s> 

she hurried out to meet him </s>
<s>  and little bob in his comforter
he had need of it poor fellowcame in </s>
<s>  his tea
was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should
help him to it most </s>
<s>  then the two young cratchits got
upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against
his face as if they said dont mind it father </s>
<s>  dont be
grieved </s>
<s> 

bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to
all the family </s>
<s>  he looked at the work upon the table and
praised the industry and speed of <abvr> cratchit and the girls </s>
<s> 
they would be done long before sunday he said </s>
<s> 

sunday </s>
<s>  you went today then robert </s>
<s>  said his
wife </s>
<s> 

yes my dear returned bob </s>
<s>  i wish you could have
gone </s>
<s>  it would have done you good to see how green a
place it is </s>
<s>  but youll see it often </s>
<s>  i promised him that i
would walk there on a sunday </s>
<s>  my little little child </s>
<s> 
cried bob </s>
<s>  my little child </s>
<s> 

he broke down all at once </s>
<s>  he couldnt help it </s>
<s>  if he
could have helped it he and his child would have been farther
apart perhaps than they were </s>
<s> 

he left the room and went upstairs into the room above
which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas </s>
<s> 
there was a chair set close beside the child and there were
signs of some one having been there lately </s>
<s>  poor bob sat
down in it and when he had thought a little and composed
himself he kissed the little face </s>
<s>  he was reconciled to what
had happened and went down again quite happy </s>
<s> 

they drew about the fire and talked </s>
<s>  the girls and mother
working still </s>
<s>  bob told them of the extraordinary kindness
of <abvr> scrooges nephew whom he had scarcely seen but
once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing
that he looked a littlejust a little down you know said
bob inquired what had happened to distress him </s>
<s>  on
which said bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman
you ever heard i told him </s>
<s>  i am heartily sorry for it <abvr>
cratchit he said and heartily sorry for your good wife </s>
<s> 
by the bye how he ever knew that i dont know </s>
<s> 

knew what my dear </s>
<s> 

why that you were a good wife replied bob </s>
<s> 

everybody knows that </s>
<s>  said peter </s>
<s> 

very well observed my boy </s>
<s>  cried bob </s>
<s>  i hope they
do </s>
<s>  heartily sorry he said for your good wife </s>
<s>  if i
can be of service to you in any way he said giving me
his card thats where i live </s>
<s>  pray come to me </s>
<s>  now it
wasnt cried bob for the sake of anything he might be
able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was
quite delightful </s>
<s>  it really seemed as if he had known our
tiny tim and felt with us </s>
<s> 

im sure hes a good soul </s>
<s>  said <abvr> cratchit </s>
<s> 

you would be surer of it my dear returned bob if
you saw and spoke to him </s>
<s>  i shouldnt be at all surprised
mark what i say </s>
<s> if he got peter a better situation </s>
<s> 

only hear that peter said <abvr> cratchit </s>
<s> 

and then cried one of the girls peter will be keeping
company with some one and setting up for himself </s>
<s> 

get along with you </s>
<s>  retorted peter grinning </s>
<s> 

its just as likely as not said bob one of these days </s>
<s> 
though theres plenty of time for that my dear </s>
<s>  but however
and whenever we part from one another i am sure we
shall none of us forget poor tiny timshall weor this
first parting that there was among us </s>
<s> 

never father </s>
<s>  cried they all </s>
<s> 

and i know said bob i know my dears that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was </s>
<s>  although he
was a little little child </s>
<s>  we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves and forget poor tiny tim in doing it </s>
<s> 

no never father </s>
<s>  they all cried again </s>
<s> 

i am very happy said little bob i am very happy </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the
two young cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook
hands </s>
<s>  spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from
god </s>
<s> 

spectre said scrooge something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand </s>
<s>  i know it but i know not
how </s>
<s>  tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead </s>
<s> 

the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as
beforethough at a different time he thought </s>
<s>  indeed there
seemed no order in these latter visions save that they were
in the futureinto the resorts of business men but showed
him not himself </s>
<s>  indeed the spirit did not stay for anything
but went straight on as to the end just now desired
until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment </s>
<s> 

this court said scrooge through which we hurry now
is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length
of time </s>
<s>  i see the house </s>
<s>  let me behold what i shall be
in days to come </s>
<s> 

the spirit stopped </s>
<s>  the hand was pointed elsewhere </s>
<s> 

the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed </s>
<s>  why do you
point away </s>
<s> 

the inexorable finger underwent no change </s>
<s> 

scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked
in </s>
<s>  it was an office still but not his </s>
<s>  the furniture was
not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself </s>
<s> 
the phantom pointed as before </s>
<s> 

he joined it once again and wondering why and whither
he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron gate </s>
<s> 
he paused to look round before entering </s>
<s> 

a churchyard </s>
<s>  here then </s>
<s>  the wretched man whose name
he had now to learn lay underneath the ground </s>
<s>  it was a
worthy place </s>
<s>  walled in by houses </s>
<s>  overrun by grass and
weeds the growth of vegetations death not life </s>
<s>  choked up
with too much burying </s>
<s>  fat with repleted appetite </s>
<s>  a
worthy place </s>
<s> 

the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to
one </s>
<s>  he advanced towards it trembling </s>
<s>  the phantom was
exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new
meaning in its solemn shape </s>
<s> 

before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point
said scrooge answer me one question </s>
<s>  are these the
shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of
things that may be only </s>
<s> 

still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
it stood </s>
<s> 

mens courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if
persevered in they must lead said scrooge </s>
<s>  but if the
courses be departed from the ends will change </s>
<s>  say it is
thus with what you show me </s>
<s> 

the spirit was immovable as ever </s>
<s> 

scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went </s>
<s>  and
following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected
grave his own name ebenezer scrooge </s>
<s> 

am i that man who lay upon the bed </s>
<s>  he cried upon
his knees </s>
<s> 

the finger pointed from the grave to him and back again </s>
<s> 

no spirit </s>
<s>  oh no no </s>
<s> 

the finger still was there </s>
<s> 

spirit </s>
<s>  he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me </s>
<s> 
i am not the man i was </s>
<s>  i will not be the man i must
have been but for this intercourse </s>
<s>  why show me this if i
am past all hope </s>
<s> 

for the first time the hand appeared to shake </s>
<s> 

good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he
fell before it </s>
<s>  your nature intercedes for me and pities
me </s>
<s>  assure me that i yet may change these shadows you
have shown me by an altered life </s>
<s> 

the kind hand trembled </s>
<s> 

i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it
all the year </s>
<s>  i will live in the past the present and the
future </s>
<s>  the spirits of all three shall strive within me </s>
<s>  i
will not shut out the lessons that they teach </s>
<s>  oh tell me i
may sponge away the writing on this stone </s>
<s> 

in his agony he caught the spectral hand </s>
<s>  it sought to
free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it </s>
<s> 
the spirit stronger yet repulsed him </s>
<s> 

holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate
reversed he saw an alteration in the phantoms hood and dress </s>
<s> 
it shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into a bedpost </s>
<s> 


stave v </s>
<s>   the end of it

yes </s>
<s>  and the bedpost was his own </s>
<s>  the bed was his own
the room was his own </s>
<s>  best and happiest of all the time
before him was his own to make amends in </s>
<s> 

i will live in the past the present and the future </s>
<s> 
scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed </s>
<s>  the spirits
of all three shall strive within me </s>
<s>  oh jacob marley </s>
<s> 
heaven and the christmas time be praised for this </s>
<s>  i say
it on my knees old jacob </s>
<s>  on my knees </s>
<s> 

he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions
that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his
call </s>
<s>  he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the
spirit and his face was wet with tears </s>
<s> 

they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of
his bedcurtains in his arms they are not torn down rings
and all </s>
<s>  they are herei am herethe shadows of the
things that would have been may be dispelled </s>
<s>  they will
be </s>
<s>  i know they will </s>
<s> 

his hands were busy with his garments all this time </s>
<s> 
turning them inside out putting them on upside down
tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every
kind of extravagance </s>
<s> 

i dont know what to do </s>
<s>  cried scrooge laughing and
crying in the same breath </s>
<s>  and making a perfect laocoön of
himself with his stockings </s>
<s>  i am as light as a feather i
am as happy as an angel i am as merry as a schoolboy </s>
<s>  i
am as giddy as a drunken man </s>
<s>  a merry christmas to
everybody </s>

he had frisked into the sittingroom and was now standing
there </s>
<s>  perfectly winded </s>
<s> 

theres the saucepan that the gruel was in </s>
<s>  cried
scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace </s>
<s> 
theres the door by which the ghost of jacob marley
entered </s>

present sat </s>

spirits </s>
<s>  its all right its all true it all happened </s>
<s> 
ha ha ha </s>

really for a man who had been out of practice for so
many years it was a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh </s>

the father of a long long line of brilliant laughs </s>

scrooge </s>

running to the window he opened it and put out his
head </s>

cold piping for the blood to dance to </s>

heavenly sky </s>

boy in sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look
about him </s>

<s>

<s>  scrooge inquired </s>
<s>

<s> 

an intelligent boy </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s>  a remarkable boy </s>
<s> 
do you know whether theyve sold the prize turkey that
was hanging up there </s>
<s> not the little prize turkey </s>
<s>  the
big one </s>
<s> 

what the one as big as me </s>
<s>  returned the boy </s>
<s> 

what a delightful boy </s>
<s>  said scrooge </s>
<s>  its a pleasure
to talk to him </s>
<s>  yes my buck </s>
<s>

<s>  exclaimed the boy </s>
<s> 

no no said scrooge i am in earnest </s>
<s>  go and buy
it and tell em to bring it here that i may give them the
direction where to take it </s>
<s>  come back with the man and
ill give you a shilling </s>
<s>  come back with him in less than
five minutes and ill give you halfacrown </s>
<s> 

the boy was off like a shot </s>
<s>  he must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast </s>
<s> 

ill send it to bob cratchits </s>
<s>  whispered scrooge
rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh </s>
<s>  he shant
know who sends it </s>
<s>  its twice the size of tiny tim </s>
<s>  joe
miller never made such a joke as sending it to bobs
will be </s>
<s> 

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one but write it he did somehow and went downstairs to
open the street door ready for the coming of the poulterers
man </s>
<s>  as he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker
caught his eye </s>
<s> 

i shall love it as long as i live </s>
<s>  cried scrooge patting
it with his hand </s>
<s>  i scarcely ever looked at it before </s>
<s> 
what an honest expression it has in its face </s>
<s>  its a
wonderful knocker </s>
<s> heres the turkey </s>

it was a turkey </s>
<s>  he never could have stood upon his

<s>  he would have snapped em short off in a
minute like sticks of sealingwax </s>
<s> 

why its impossible to carry that to camden town
said scrooge </s>
<s>  you must have a cab </s>
<s> 

the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with
which he paid for the turkey and the chuckle with which
he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed
the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle
with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and
chuckled till he cried </s>
<s> 

shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to
shake very much </s>
<s>  and shaving requires attention even when
you dont dance while you are at it </s>
<s>  but if he had cut the
end of his nose off he would have put a piece of
stickingplaister over it and been quite satisfied </s>
<s> 

he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out
into the streets </s>
<s>  the people were by this time pouring forth
as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present </s>
<s> 
and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded
every one with a delighted smile </s>
<s>  he looked so irresistibly
pleasant in a word that three or four goodhumoured fellows
said good morning sir </s>
<s>  a merry christmas to you </s>
<s> 
and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe
sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears </s>
<s> 

he had not gone far when coming on towards him he
beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his
countinghouse the day before and said scrooge and marleys i
believe </s>
<s>   it sent a pang across his heart to think how this
old gentleman would look upon him when they met </s>
<s>  but he
knew what path lay straight before him and he took it </s>
<s> 

my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and
taking the old gentleman by both his hands </s>
<s>  how do you
do </s>
<s>  i hope you succeeded yesterday </s>
<s>  it was very kind of
you </s>

scrooge was better than his word </s>
<s>  he did it all and
infinitely more </s>
<s>  and to tiny tim who did not die he was
a second father </s>
<s>  he became as good a friend as good a
master and as good a man as the good old city knew or
any other good old city town or borough in the good old
world </s>
<s>  some people laughed to see the alteration in him
but he let them laugh and little heeded them </s>
<s>  for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe for good at which some people did not have their fill
of laughter in the outset </s>
<s>  and knowing that such as these
would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in
less attractive forms </s>
<s>  his own heart laughed </s>
<s>  and that was
quite enough for him </s>
<s> 

he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon
the total abstinence principle ever afterwards </s>
<s>  and it was
always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas
well if any man alive possessed the knowledge </s>
<s>  may that
be truly said of us and all of us </s>

observed god bless us every one </s>

i give pirrip as my fathers family name on the authority of his
tombstone and my sistermrs </s>

as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness
of either of them for their days were long before the days of
photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones </s>

my mother was freckled and sickly </s>
<s>  to five little stone lozenges each

their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
minewho gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in

entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands

ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river
wound twenty miles of the sea </s>

of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening </s>

that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the
above were dead and buried </s>

tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead

intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle
feeding on it was the marshes </s>

was the river </s>

rushing was the sea </s>

of it all and beginning to cry was pip </s>

after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer
to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he
could hold me </s>

<s> 

i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both
hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright
sir perhaps i shouldnt be sick and perhaps i could attend more </s>
<s> 

he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock </s>
<s>  then he held me by the arms in an upright
position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms </s>

you bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittles </s>

bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder </s>

man off of your inside </s>

i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken
bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in

much of that </s>

wish i was a frog </s>

<s> 

at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his
armsclasping himself as if to hold himself togetherand limped
towards the low church wall </s>
<s>  as i saw him go picking his way among the
nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people
stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his
ankle and pull him in </s>
<s> 

when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me </s>

saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of
my legs </s>
<s>  but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on
again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking
his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there for steppingplaces when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in </s>
<s> 

the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped
to look after him </s>
<s>  and the river was just another horizontal line not
nearly so broad nor yet so black </s>
<s>  and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed </s>
<s>  on the edge of the
river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright </s>
<s>  one of these was the beacon
by which the sailors steeredlike an unhooped cask upon a polean
ugly thing when you were near it </s>
<s>  the other a gibbet with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate </s>
<s>  the man was limping on
towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come
down and going back to hook himself up again </s>
<s>  it gave me a terrible
turn when i thought so </s>
<s>  and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too </s>
<s>  i looked all
round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him </s>
<s>  but now
i was frightened again and ran home without stopping </s>

chapter ii

my sister <abvr> joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she had brought me up by hand </s>
<s>  having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and
heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as
well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up
by hand </s>
<s> 

she was not a goodlooking woman my sister </s>
<s>  and i had a general
impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand </s>
<s>  joe
was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites </s>
<s>  he was a mild
goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dear fellowa sort
of hercules in strength and also in weakness </s>
<s> 

my sister <abvr> joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing
redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap </s>
<s>  she was tall
and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her
figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in
front that was stuck full of pins and needles </s>
<s>  she made it a powerful
merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this
apron so much </s>
<s>  though i really see no reason why she should have worn it
at all </s>
<s>  or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it
off every day of her life </s>
<s> 

joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the
dwellings in our country weremost of them at that time </s>
<s>  when i ran
home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen </s>
<s>  joe and i being fellowsufferers and having
confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it
sitting in the chimney corner </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip </s>
<s>  and shes
out now making it a bakers dozen </s>
<s> 

is she </s>
<s> 

yes pip said joe </s>
<s>  and whats worse shes got tickler with her </s>
<s> 

at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round and looked in great depression at the fire </s>
<s>  tickler
was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame </s>
<s> 

she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at
tickler and she rampaged out </s>
<s>  thats what she did said joe slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at
it </s>
<s>  she rampaged out pip </s>
<s> 

has she been gone long joe </s>
<s>  i always treated him as a larger species
of child and as no more than my equal </s>
<s> 

well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock shes been on the
rampage this last spell about five minutes pip </s>
<s>  shes a coming </s>
<s>  get
behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you </s>
<s> 

i took the advice </s>
<s>  my sister <abvr> joe throwing the door wide open
and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and
applied tickler to its further investigation </s>
<s>  she concluded by throwing
mei often served as a connubial missileat joe who glad to get hold
of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his great leg </s>
<s> 

where have you been you young monkey </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe stamping her
foot </s>
<s>  tell me directly what youve been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit or id have you out of that corner if you was
fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys </s>
<s> 

i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and
rubbing myself </s>
<s> 

churchyard </s>
<s>  repeated my sister </s>
<s>  if it warnt for me youd have been
to the churchyard long ago and stayed there </s>
<s>  who brought you up by
hand </s>
<s> 

you did said i </s>
<s> 

and why did i do it i should like to know </s>
<s>  exclaimed my sister </s>
<s> 

i whimpered i dont know </s>
<s> 

i dont </s>
<s>  said my sister </s>
<s>  id never do it again </s>
<s>  i know that </s>
<s>  i may
truly say ive never had this apron of mine off since born you were </s>
<s> 
its bad enough to be a blacksmiths wife and him a gargery without
being your mother </s>
<s> 

my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at
the fire </s>
<s>  for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the
mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me
in the avenging coals </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe restoring tickler to his station </s>
<s>  churchyard
indeed </s>
<s>  you may well say churchyard you two </s>
<s>  one of us by the by had
not said it at all </s>
<s>  youll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one
of these days and o a prrrecious pair youd be without me </s>
<s> 

as she applied herself to set the teathings joe peeped down at me
over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed </s>
<s>  after that he sat feeling his
rightside flaxen curls and whisker and following <abvr> joe about with
his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times </s>
<s> 

my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us
that never varied </s>
<s>  first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bibwhere it sometimes got a pin into it and
sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths </s>
<s>  then she
took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in
an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plasterusing both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust </s>
<s>  then she gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf </s>
<s>  which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into
two halves of which joe got one and i the other </s>
<s> 

on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my
slice </s>
<s>  i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man </s>
<s>  i knew
mrs </s>
<s>  joes housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe </s>
<s>  therefore
i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers </s>
<s> 

the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i
found to be quite awful </s>
<s>  it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water </s>
<s> 
and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe </s>
<s>  in
our alreadymentioned freemasonry as fellowsufferers and in his
goodnatured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each
others admiration now and thenwhich stimulated us to new exertions </s>
<s> 
tonight joe several times invited me by the display of his fast
diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition </s>
<s>  but
he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and
my untouched bread and butter on the other </s>
<s>  at last i desperately
considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances </s>
<s>  i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at
me and got my bread and butter down my leg </s>
<s> 

joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he
didnt seem to enjoy </s>
<s>  he turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like
a pill </s>
<s>  he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone </s>
<s> 

the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold
of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sisters
observation </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  said she smartly as she put down her cup </s>
<s> 

i say you know </s>
<s>  muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance </s>
<s>  pip old chap </s>
<s>  youll do yourself a mischief </s>
<s>  itll stick
somewhere </s>
<s>  you cant have chawed it pip </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  repeated my sister more sharply than before </s>
<s> 

if you can cough any trifle on it up pip id recommend you to do it
 said joe all aghast </s>
<s>  manners is manners but still your elths your
elth </s>
<s> 

by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe
and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while
against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily
on </s>
<s> 

now perhaps youll mention whats the matter said my sister out of
breath you staring great stuck pig </s>
<s> 

joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and
looked at me again </s>
<s> 

you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek
and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone
you and me is always friends and id be the last to tell upon you
any time </s>
<s>  but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us and then again at mesuch a most oncommon bolt as that </s>
<s> 

been bolting his food has he </s>
<s>  cried my sister </s>
<s> 

you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at <abvr> joe
with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your
agefrequentand as a boy ive been among a many bolters </s>
<s>  but i never
see your bolting equal yet pip and its a mercy you aint bolted
dead </s>
<s> 

my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying
nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed </s>
<s> 

some medical beast had revived tarwater in those days as a fine
medicine and <abvr> joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard </s>
<s> 
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness </s>
<s>  at the
best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new
fence </s>
<s>  on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater
comfort while <abvr> joe held my head under her arm as a boot would
be held in a bootjack </s>
<s>  joe got off with half a pint </s>
<s>  but was made to
swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire because he had had a turn </s>
<s>  judging from
myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had
none before </s>
<s> 

conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy </s>
<s>  but when in
the case of a boy that secret burden cooperates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great

<s>  the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob <abvr> joei
never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as hisunited to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind </s>
<s>  then
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the
voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy declaring that he couldnt and wouldnt starve until tomorrow
but must be fed now </s>
<s>  at other times i thought what if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver tonight
instead of tomorrow </s>

mine must have done so then </s>

<s> 

it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with
a copperstick from seven to eight by the dutch clock </s>
<s>  i tried it with
the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable </s>
<s>  happily i slipped away
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom </s>

in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed </s>

mouth into the forms of saying to joe whats a convict </s>

mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i

drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work

it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be
told lies by her even if i did ask questions </s>

unless there was company </s>

at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like sulks </s>

joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her </s>

hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it </s>

i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs

no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror </s>

mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver </s>

me at every turn </s>

covered earthenware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and

not be missed for some time </s>

there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge </s>

unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joes tools </s>

marshes </s>

chapter iii

it was a rimy morning and very damp </s>
<s>  i had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all
night and using the window for a pockethandkerchief </s>
<s>  now i saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of
spiders webs </s>
<s>  hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade </s>
<s>  on
every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our villagea
direction which they never accepted for they never came therewas
invisible to me until i was quite close under it </s>
<s>  then as i looked up
at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the hulks </s>
<s> 

the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that
instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me </s>
<s> 
this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind </s>
<s>  the gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly
as could be a boy with somebody elses pork pie </s>
<s>  stop him </s>
<s>  the
cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes
and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief </s>
<s>  one black
ox with a white cravat onwho even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical airfixed me so obstinately with his eyes
and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved
round that i blubbered out to him i couldnt help it sir </s>
<s>  it wasnt
for myself i took it </s>
<s>  upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of
smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickup of his hindlegs and
a flourish of his tail </s>
<s> 

all this time i was getting on towards the river </s>
<s>  but however fast i
went i couldnt warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet </s>
<s>  i knew
my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a
sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when
i was �prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there </s>
<s> 
however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to
the right and consequently had to try back along the riverside on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out </s>
<s>  making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a
ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me </s>
<s> 
his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding
forward heavy with sleep </s>
<s> 

i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast
in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on
the shoulder </s>
<s>  he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but
another man </s>
<s> 

and yet this man was dressed in coarse gray too and had a great iron
on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that
the other man was </s>
<s>  except that he had not the same face and had a flat
broadbrimmed lowcrowned felt hat on </s>
<s>  all this i saw in a moment for
i had only a moment to see it in </s>
<s>  he swore an oath at me made a hit at
meit was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down for it made him stumbleand then he ran into the mist stumbling
twice as he went and i lost him </s>
<s> 

its the young man </s>
<s>  i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified
him </s>
<s>  i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had
known where it was </s>
<s> 

i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right
manhugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all
night left off hugging and limpingwaiting for me </s>
<s>  he was awfully
cold to be sure </s>
<s>  i half expected to see him drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold </s>
<s>  his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when
i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle </s>
<s>  he did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me
right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets </s>
<s> 

whats in the bottle boy </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

brandy said i </s>
<s> 

he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
mannermore like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry than a man who was eating itbut he left off to take some of
the liquor </s>
<s>  he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite
as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth
without biting it off </s>
<s> 

i think you have got the ague said i </s>

im much of your opinion boy said he </s>

<s> 

he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all
at once </s>
<s>  staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
us and often stoppingeven stopping his jawsto listen </s>
<s>  some real or
fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly

<s> 

something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock

eyes </s>

pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down
upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it </s>

thankee my boy </s>

noticed a decided similarity between the dogs way of eating and the
mans </s>
<s>  the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog </s>
<s>  he
swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast </s>
<s> 
and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought
there was danger in every direction of somebodys coming to take the pie
away </s>
<s>  he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate
it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without
making a chop with his jaws at the visitor </s>
<s>  in all of which particulars
he was very like the dog </s>
<s> 

i am afraid you wont leave any of it for him said i timidly </s>
<s>  after
a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark </s>
<s>  theres no more to be got where that came from </s>

just now </s>

where </s>

yonder said i pointing </s>

i wonder you shouldnt have been sure of that i returned for

and he looked up at it for an instant </s>

grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding
his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file </s>
<s>  i
was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into
this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer </s>

of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg </s>

i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still
going </s>

chapter iv

i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me
up </s>
<s>  but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery </s>
<s>  <abvr> joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpanan article into
which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment </s>
<s> 

and where the deuce ha you been </s>
<s>  was <abvr> joes christmas salutation
when i and my conscience showed ourselves </s>
<s> 

i said i had been down to hear the carols </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  observed <abvr>
joe </s>
<s>  you might ha done worse </s>
<s>  not a doubt of that i thought </s>
<s> 

perhaps if i warnt a blacksmiths wife and whats the same thing a
slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols
 said <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  im rather partial to carols myself and thats the
best of reasons for my never hearing any </s>
<s> 

joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
conciliatory air when <abvr> joe darted a look at him and when her eyes
were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them
to me as our token that <abvr> joe was in a cross temper </s>
<s>  this was so
much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together
be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs </s>
<s> 

we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls </s>
<s>  a handsome mincepie had
been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed and the pudding was already on the boil </s>
<s>  these extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast </s>
<s>  for i aint said <abvr> joei aint a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what ive got
before me i promise you </s>
<s> 

so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home </s>
<s>  and we took gulps of milk
and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser </s>
<s>  in
the meantime <abvr> joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage which was never
uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantelshelf each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of
making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself </s>
<s>  cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by
their religion </s>
<s> 

my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that
is to say joe and i were going </s>
<s>  in his workingclothes joe was a
wellknit characteristiclooking blacksmith </s>
<s>  in his holiday clothes
he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else </s>
<s> 
nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him </s>
<s>  and
everything that he wore then grazed him </s>
<s>  on the present festive occasion
he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture
of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials </s>
<s>  as to me i think my
sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom
an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over
to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law </s>
<s> 
i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends </s>
<s>  even when i was taken to have
a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs </s>
<s> 

joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds </s>
<s>  yet what i suffered outside was nothing to
what i underwent within </s>
<s>  the terrors that had assailed me whenever
mrs </s>
<s>  joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done </s>
<s>  under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the
church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment </s>
<s>  i conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said
ye are now to declare it </s>
<s>  would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry </s>
<s>  i am far from being sure that i
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday </s>

everything most splendid </s>
<s>  and still not a word of the robbery </s>

the company came </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of </s>
<s>  indeed
it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him
his head he would read the clergyman into fits </s>
<s>  he himself confessed
that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would
not despair of making his mark in it </s>
<s>  the church not being thrown
open he was as i have said our clerk </s>
<s>  but he punished the amens
tremendously </s>

versehe looked all round the congregation first as much as to say

<s>  oblige me with your opinion of this
style </s>
<s> 

i opened the door to the companymaking believe that it was a habit

slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair

all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the
compliments of the seasoni have brought you mum a bottle of sherry
wineand i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine </s>

every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with
exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells </s>

bobbish and hows sixpennorth of halfpence </s>

we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor </s>
<s>  which was a change very like
joes change from his workingclothes to his sunday dress </s>
<s>  my sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of <abvr> hubble than in other company </s>

conventionally juvenile position because she had married <abvr> hubblei

sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart </s>

among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadnt
robbed the pantry in a false position </s>
<s>  not because i was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the
pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak

it began the moment we sat down to dinner </s>

theatrical declamationas it now appears to me something like a
religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the thirdand

<s>  this moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until <abvr> hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally
wicious </s>
<s>  everybody then murmured true </s>
<s>  and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner </s>
<s> 

joes station and influence were something feebler if possible when
there was company than when there was none </s>

comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so
at dinnertime by giving me gravy if there were any </s>

pint </s>
<s> 

a little later on in the dinner <abvr> wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity and intimatedin the usual hypothetical case of the
church being thrown openwhat kind of sermon he would have given
them </s>

that he considered the subject of the days homily ill chosen </s>

was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects
going about </s>

true again said uncle pumblechook </s>

true sir </s>

from that text </s>

you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis </s>

joe gave me some more gravy </s>
<s> 

swine pursued <abvr> wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork
at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian nameswine were
the companions of the prodigal </s>

of course or girl <abvr> hubble assented <abvr> wopsle rather irritably

again </s>

catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts

the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it

table with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his

round several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingcough dance

apparently out of his mind </s>

i held on tight while <abvr> joe and joe ran to him </s>

there </s>
<s> 

but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnt
hear the word wouldnt hear of the subject imperiously waved it all
away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water </s>

begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemonpeel and mixing
them </s>

leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude </s>

by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding </s>

the course terminated and <abvr> pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water </s>

the day when my sister said to joe clean platescold </s>

i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul </s>

no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip </s>

been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror

table and ran for my life </s>

chapter v

the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their
loaded muskets on our doorstep caused the dinnerparty to rise
from table in confusion and caused <abvr> joe reentering the kitchen
emptyhanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of
gracious goodness gracious me whats gonewith thepie </s>
<s> 

the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when <abvr> joe stood staring </s>
<s> 
at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses </s>
<s>  it was
the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the
company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his
right hand and his left on my shoulder </s>
<s> 

excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadnt i
am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith </s>
<s> 

and pray what might you want with him </s>
<s>  retorted my sister quick to
resent his being wanted at all </s>
<s> 

missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should
reply the honor and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance </s>
<s>  speaking
for the king i answer a little job done </s>
<s> 

this was received as rather neat in the sergeant </s>
<s>  insomuch that <abvr>
pumblechook cried audibly good again </s>
<s> 

you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked
out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find
the lock of one of �em goes wrong and the coupling dont act pretty </s>
<s> 
as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over
them </s>
<s> 

joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer
two hours than one </s>
<s>  will it </s>
<s>  then will you set about it at once
blacksmith </s>
<s>  said the offhand sergeant as its on his majestys
service </s>
<s>  and if my men can bear a hand anywhere theyll make themselves
useful </s>
<s>  with that he called to his men who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner </s>
<s>  and then
they stood about as soldiers do </s>
<s>  now with their hands loosely clasped
before them </s>
<s>  now resting a knee or a shoulder </s>
<s>  now easing a belt or a
pouch </s>
<s>  now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out
into the yard </s>
<s> 

all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i
was in an agony of apprehension </s>
<s>  but beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little
more of my scattered wits </s>
<s> 

would you give me the time </s>
<s>  said the sergeant addressing himself to
mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he was equal to the time </s>
<s> 

its just gone half past two </s>
<s> 

thats not so bad said the sergeant reflecting </s>
<s>  even if i was
forced to halt here nigh two hours thatll do </s>
<s>  how far might you call
yourselves from the marshes hereabouts </s>
<s>  not above a mile i reckon </s>
<s> 

just a mile said <abvr> joe </s>
<s> 

thatll do </s>
<s>  we begin to close in upon �em about dusk </s>
<s>  a little before
dusk my orders are </s>
<s>  thatll do </s>
<s> 

convicts sergeant </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> wopsle in a matterofcourse way </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  returned the sergeant two </s>
<s>  theyre pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still and they wont try to get clear of �em before
dusk </s>
<s>  anybody here seen anything of any such game </s>
<s> 

everybody myself excepted said no with confidence </s>
<s>  nobody thought of
me </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the sergeant theyll find themselves trapped in a circle
i expect sooner than they count on </s>
<s>  now blacksmith </s>
<s>  if youre ready
his majesty the king is </s>
<s> 

joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron
on and passed into the forge </s>
<s>  one of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the
rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring </s>
<s>  then joe began to
hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on </s>
<s> 

the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention but even made my sister liberal </s>
<s>  she drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy </s>
<s>  but <abvr> pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum </s>
<s>  ill
engage theres no tar in that </s>
<s>  so the sergeant thanked him and said
that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it
was equally convenient </s>
<s>  when it was given him he drank his majestys
health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his lips </s>
<s> 

good stuff eh sergeant </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

ill tell you something returned the sergeant </s>
<s>  i suspect that
stuffs of your providing </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay </s>
<s>  why </s>
<s> 

because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder youre
a man that knows whats what </s>
<s> 

dye think so </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook with his former laugh </s>
<s>  have
another glass </s>
<s> 

with you </s>
<s>  hob and nob returned the sergeant </s>
<s>  the top of mine to the
foot of yoursthe foot of yours to the top of minering once ring
twicethe best tune on the musical glasses </s>
<s>  your health </s>
<s>  may you live
a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life </s>
<s> 

the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass </s>
<s>  i noticed that <abvr> pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the
bottle from <abvr> joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality </s>
<s>  even i got some </s>
<s>  and he was so very free of the wine
that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the
same liberality when the first was gone </s>
<s> 

as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge
enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was </s>
<s>  they had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he furnished </s>
<s>  and now when they were all in lively
anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank and the redhot sparks dropped and died the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account poor wretches </s>
<s> 

at last joes job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped </s>
<s>  as joe
got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook
and <abvr> hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  wopsle said he would go if joe would </s>
<s>  joe said he was agreeable
and would take me if <abvr> joe approved </s>
<s>  we never should have got leave
to go i am sure but for <abvr> joes curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended </s>
<s>  as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy
back with his head blown to bits by a musket dont look to me to put it
together again </s>
<s> 

the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from <abvr>
pumblechook as from a comrade </s>
<s>  though i doubt if he were quite as fully
sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions as when
something moist was going </s>
<s>  his men resumed their muskets and fell in </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes </s>
<s>  when we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably
whispered to joe i hope joe we shant find them </s>
<s>  and joe whispered
to me id give a shilling if they had cut and run pip </s>
<s> 

we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was
cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming
on and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day </s>
<s>  a
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came
out </s>
<s>  we passed the fingerpost and held straight on to the churchyard </s>
<s> 
there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeants
hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the
graves and also examined the porch </s>
<s>  they came in again without finding
anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate
at the side of the churchyard </s>
<s>  a bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind and joe took me on his back </s>
<s> 

now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should
come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who
had brought the soldiers there </s>
<s>  he had asked me if i was a deceiving
imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the
hunt against him </s>
<s>  would he believe that i was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest and had betrayed him </s>
<s> 

it was of no use asking myself this question now </s>
<s>  there i was on joes
back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a
hunter and stimulating <abvr> wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and
to keep up with us </s>
<s>  the soldiers were in front of us extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man </s>
<s>  we were taking
the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist </s>
<s> 
either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it </s>
<s> 
under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the
mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain
though all of a watery lead color </s>
<s> 

with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joes broad shoulder i
looked all about for any sign of the convicts </s>
<s>  i could see none i could
hear none </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his
blowing and hard breathing </s>
<s>  but i knew the sounds by this time and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit </s>
<s>  i got a dreadful
start when i thought i heard the file still going </s>
<s>  but it was only a
sheepbell </s>
<s>  the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us </s>
<s>  and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances </s>
<s>  but except
these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes </s>
<s> 

the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we
were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all
stopped </s>
<s>  for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a
long shout </s>
<s>  it was repeated </s>
<s>  it was at a distance towards the east but
it was long and loud </s>
<s>  nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
togetherif one might judge from a confusion in the sound </s>
<s> 

to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath when joe and i came up </s>
<s>  after another moments listening
joe who was a good judge agreed and <abvr> wopsle who was a bad judge
agreed </s>
<s>  the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not
be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men
should make towards it at the double </s>
<s>  so we slanted to the right
where the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to
hold on tight to keep my seat </s>
<s> 

it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he
spoke all the time a winder </s>
<s>  down banks and up banks and over gates
and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes </s>
<s>  no man cared
where he went </s>
<s>  as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice </s>
<s>  sometimes it
seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped </s>
<s>  when it broke
out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we
after them </s>
<s>  after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one
voice calling murder </s>
<s>  and another voice convicts </s>
<s>  runaways </s>
<s>  guard </s>
<s> 
this way for the runaway convicts </s>
<s>  then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle and then would break out again </s>
<s>  and when it had
come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too </s>
<s> 

the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two
of his men ran in close upon him </s>
<s>  their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in </s>
<s> 

here are both men </s>
<s>  panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a
ditch </s>
<s>  surrender you two </s>
<s>  and confound you for two wild beasts </s>
<s>  come
asunder </s>
<s> 

water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and
blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other
one </s>
<s>  both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling </s>
<s>  but
of course i knew them both directly </s>
<s> 

mind </s>
<s>  said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged
sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers </s>
<s>  i took him </s>
<s>  i give him
up to you </s>
<s>  mind that </s>
<s> 

its not much to be particular about said the sergeant </s>
<s>  itll do you
small good my man being in the same plight yourself </s>
<s>  handcuffs there </s>
<s> 

i dont expect it to do me any good </s>
<s>  i dont want it to do me more good
than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh </s>
<s>  i took him </s>
<s>  he
knows it </s>
<s>  thats enough for me </s>
<s> 

the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over </s>
<s> 
he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both
separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling </s>
<s> 

take notice guardhe tried to murder me were his first words </s>
<s> 

tried to murder him </s>
<s>  said my convict disdainfully </s>
<s>  try and not
do it </s>
<s>  i took him and giv him up </s>
<s>  thats what i done </s>
<s>  i not only
prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him heredragged
him this far on his way back </s>
<s>  hes a gentleman if you please this
villain </s>
<s>  now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me </s>
<s>  murder
him </s>
<s>  worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag
him back </s>
<s> 

the other one still gasped he triedhe triedtomurder me </s>
<s> 
bearbear witness </s>
<s> 

lookee here </s>
<s>  said my convict to the sergeant </s>
<s>  singlehanded i got
clear of the prisonship </s>
<s>  i made a dash and i done it </s>
<s>  i could ha got
clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg </s>
<s>  you wont find
much iron on itif i hadnt made the discovery that he was here </s>
<s>  let
him go free </s>
<s>  let him profit by the means as i found out </s>
<s>  let him make a
tool of me afresh and again </s>
<s>  once more </s>
<s>  no no no </s>
<s>  if i had died at
the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his
manacled hands id have held to him with that grip that you should
have been safe to find him in my hold </s>
<s> 

the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion repeated he tried to murder me </s>
<s>  i should have been a dead
man if you had not come up </s>
<s> 

he lies </s>
<s>  said my convict with fierce energy </s>
<s>  hes a liar born and
hell die a liar </s>
<s>  look at his face </s>
<s>  aint it written there </s>
<s>  let him turn
those eyes of his on me </s>
<s>  i defy him to do it </s>
<s> 

the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however
collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked
at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but
certainly did not look at the speaker </s>
<s> 

do you see him </s>
<s>  pursued my convict </s>
<s>  do you see what a villain he is </s>
<s> 
do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes </s>
<s>  thats how he looked
when we were tried together </s>
<s>  he never looked at me </s>
<s> 

the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with
a halftaunting glance at the bound hands </s>
<s>  at that point my convict
became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him
but for the interposition of the soldiers </s>
<s>  didnt i tell you said the
other convict then that he would murder me if he could </s>
<s>  and any one
could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his
lips curious white flakes like thin snow </s>
<s> 

enough of this parley said the sergeant </s>
<s>  light those torches </s>
<s> 

as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down
on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time
and saw me </s>
<s>  i had alighted from joes back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up and had not moved since </s>
<s>  i looked at him eagerly when
he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head </s>
<s>  i had
been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my
innocence </s>
<s>  it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended
my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it
all passed in a moment </s>
<s>  but if he had looked at me for an hour or for
a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having
been more attentive </s>
<s> 

the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four
torches and took one himself and distributed the others </s>
<s>  it had been
almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards
very dark </s>
<s>  before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in
a ring fired twice into the air </s>
<s>  presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river </s>
<s>  all right said the sergeant </s>
<s>  march </s>
<s> 

we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear </s>
<s>  you are expected
on board said the sergeant to my convict </s>
<s>  they know you are coming </s>
<s> 
dont straggle my man </s>
<s>  close up here </s>
<s> 

the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard </s>
<s> 
i had hold of joes hand now and joe carried one of the torches </s>
<s>  <abvr>
wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so
we went on with the party </s>
<s>  there was a reasonably good path now mostly
on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike
came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluicegate </s>
<s>  when
i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us </s>
<s>  the
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and
i could see those too lying smoking and flaring </s>
<s>  i could see nothing
else but black darkness </s>
<s>  our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets </s>
<s>  we could not go fast because
of their lameness </s>
<s>  and they were so spent that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested </s>
<s> 

after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landingplace </s>
<s>  there was a guard in the hut and they challenged
and the sergeant answered </s>
<s>  then we went into the hut where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and
a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once </s>
<s>  three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
greatcoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again </s>
<s>  the sergeant made some
kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i
call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board
first </s>
<s> 

my convict never looked at me except that once </s>
<s>  while we stood in the
hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up
his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he pitied them for their recent adventures </s>
<s>  suddenly he turned to the
sergeant and remarked

i wish to say something respecting this escape </s>
<s>  it may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me </s>
<s> 

you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly
looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it
here </s>
<s>  youll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it
before its done with you know </s>
<s> 

i know but this is another pint a separate matter </s>
<s>  a man cant
starve </s>
<s>  at least i cant </s>
<s>  i took some wittles up at the willage over
yonderwhere the church stands amost out on the marshes </s>
<s>

and ill tell you where from </s>
<s>  from the blacksmiths </s>

it was some broken wittlesthats what it wasand a dram of liquor
and a pie </s>

have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith </s>
<s>  asked
the sergeant confidentially </s>
<s> 

my wife did at the very moment when you came in </s>
<s>  dont you know pip </s>
<s> 

so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and
without the least glance at meso youre the blacksmith are you </s>
<s> 
than im sorry to say ive eat your pie </s>
<s> 

god knows youre welcome to itso far as it was ever mine returned
joe with a saving remembrance of <abvr> joe </s>

done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable
fellowcreatur </s>
<s> would us pip </s>
<s> 

the something that i had noticed before clicked in the mans throat
again and he turned his back </s>
<s>  the boat had returned and his guard were
ready so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough stakes
and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself </s>
<s>  no one seemed surprised to see him or interested
in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way
you </s>
<s>  which was the signal for the dip of the oars </s>
<s>  by the light of the
torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore like a wicked noahs ark </s>
<s>  cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners </s>
<s>  we saw the boat go alongside and we saw
him taken up the side and disappear </s>
<s>  then the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with
him </s>

chapter vi

my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure </s>
<s>  but i hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it </s>
<s> 

i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to <abvr> joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me </s>
<s>  but
i loved joeperhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love himand as to him my inner self
was not so easily composed </s>
<s>  it was much upon my mind particularly when
i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe the
whole truth </s>
<s>  yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that
if i did he would think me worse than i was </s>
<s>  the fear of losing joes
confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my
tongue </s>
<s>  i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never
afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker
without thinking that he was meditating on it </s>
<s>  that if joe knew it i
never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterdays
meat or pudding when it came on todays table without thinking that he
was debating whether i had been in the pantry </s>
<s>  that if joe knew it and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his
beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it
would bring a rush of blood to my face </s>
<s>  in a word i was too cowardly
to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what i knew to be wrong </s>
<s>  i had had no intercourse with the world at
that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner </s>
<s>  quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of
action for myself </s>
<s> 

as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship joe took
me on his back again and carried me home </s>
<s>  he must have had a tiresome
journey of it for <abvr> wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad
temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself </s>
<s>  in
his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have
hanged him if it had been a capital offence </s>
<s> 

by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having
been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues </s>
<s>  as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the
shoulders and the restorative exclamation yah </s>
<s>  was there ever such
a boy as this </s>
<s>  from my sister i found joe telling them about the
convicts confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways
by which he had got into the pantry </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook made out after
carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of
the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut
into strips </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> pumblechook was very positive and drove his
own chaisecartover everybodyit was agreed that it must be so </s>
<s>  <abvr>
wopsle indeed wildly cried out no </s>
<s>  with the feeble malice of a
tired man </s>
<s>  but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously
set at naughtnot to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood
with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out </s>
<s>  which was not
calculated to inspire confidence </s>
<s> 

this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a
slumberous offence to the companys eyesight and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be
dangling them all against the edges of the stairs </s>
<s>  my state of mind as
i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted
long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned
saving on exceptional occasions </s>
<s> 




chapter vii

at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out </s>
<s>  my
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i
read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my fathers
exaltation to a better world </s>
<s>  and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family </s>
<s>  neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at
all accurate </s>
<s>  for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my
declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life
 laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwrights or up by the mill </s>
<s> 

when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could
assume that dignity i was not to be what <abvr> joe called pompeyed or
as i render it pampered </s>
<s>  therefore i was not only oddboy about the
forge but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favored with the
employment </s>
<s>  in order however that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby a moneybox was kept on the kitchen mantelshelf
into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped </s>
<s>  i have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsles greataunt kept an evening school in the village </s>
<s>  that is
to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving
opportunity of seeing her do it </s>
<s>  she rented a small cottage and <abvr>
wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling </s>
<s>  there was a fiction that <abvr> wopsle examined
 the scholars once a quarter </s>
<s>  what he did on those occasions was to turn
up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antonys oration over
the body of caesar </s>
<s>  this was always followed by collinss ode on
the passions wherein i particularly venerated <abvr> wopsle as revenge
throwing his bloodstained sword in thunder down and taking the
wardenouncing trumpet with a withering look </s>
<s>  it was not with me then
as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions
and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsles greataunt besides keeping this educational institution
kept in the same rooma little general shop </s>
<s>  she had no idea what stock
she had or what the price of anything in it was </s>
<s>  but there was a little
greasy memorandumbook kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue
of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions </s>
<s> 
biddy was <abvr> wopsles greataunts granddaughter </s>
<s>  i confess myself
quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was
to <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s>  she was an orphan like myself </s>
<s>  like me too had been
brought up by hand </s>
<s>  she was most noticeable i thought in respect of
her extremities </s>
<s>  for her hair always wanted brushing her hands always
wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel </s>
<s>  this description must be received with a weekday limitation </s>
<s>  on
sundays she went to church elaborated </s>
<s> 

much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of <abvr>
wopsles greataunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramblebush </s>
<s>  getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter </s>
<s>  after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition </s>
<s>  but at last i began in a purblind groping way to
read write and cipher on the very smallest scale </s>
<s> 

one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to joe </s>
<s>  i think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long
time after and it was winter and a hard frost </s>
<s>  with an alphabet on the
hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print
and smear this epistle </s>
<s>

<s> 

there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by
letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone </s>
<s>  but i delivered
this written communication slate and all with my own hand and joe
received it as a miracle of erudition </s>
<s> 

i say pip old chap </s>

scholar you are </s>
<s>  ant you </s>

i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it </s>

a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly </s>

a o pip and a jo joe </s>
<s> 

i had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i
accidentally held our prayerbook upside down that it seemed to suit
his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right </s>

embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i
should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah </s>

rest jo </s>

one two three </s>
<s>  why heres three js and three os and three jo
joes in it pip </s>

i leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole
letter </s>

<s>  you are a scholar </s>
<s> 

how do you spell gargery joe </s>
<s>  i asked him with a modest patronage </s>

after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a j and a o and
says you �here at last is a jo joe how interesting reading is </s>

i derived from this that joes education like steam was yet in its
infancy </s>
<s>  pursuing the subject i inquired

didnt you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me </s>
<s> 

no pip </s>
<s> 

why didnt you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me </s>
<s> 

well pip said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to
his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire
between the lower bars </s>
<s>  ill tell you </s>
<s>  my father pip he were given
to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at
my mother most onmerciful </s>
<s>  it were amost the only hammering he did

yes joe </s>

�consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several
times </s>

crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was that

up to him </s>

<s>  which you see
pip said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and
looking at me were a drawback on my learning </s>
<s> 

certainly poor joe </s>
<s> 

though mind you pip said joe with a judicial touch or two of the
poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining
equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart
dont you see </s>

i didnt see </s>
<s>  but i didnt say so </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  joe pursued somebody must keep the pot a biling pip or the
pot wont bile dont you know </s>

�consequence my father didnt make objections to my going to work </s>

i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he
would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip </s>

in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a
purple leptic fit </s>
<s>  and it were my intentions to have had put upon his
tombstone that whatsumeer the failings on his part remember reader he
were that good in his heart </s>

joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself </s>
<s> 

i made it said joe my own self </s>
<s>  i made it in a moment </s>
<s>  it was like
striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow </s>

surprised in all my lifecouldnt credit my own edto tell you the

joes blue eyes turned a little watery </s>

then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the
round knob on the top of the poker </s>

sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candor compels fur

joe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital

say very serious to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother

listen for the chaisecart </s>
<s>  it was a dry cold night and the wind blew
keenly and the frost was white and hard </s>
<s>  a man would die tonight of
lying out on the marshes i thought </s>
<s>  and then i looked at the stars and
considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them
as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering
multitude </s>
<s> 

here comes the mare said joe ringing like a peal of bells </s>
<s> 

the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she
came along at a much brisker trot than usual </s>

for <abvr> joes alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a
bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
be out of its place </s>

drove up wrapped to the eyes </s>

pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we

throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings

chapter viii

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechooks premises in the high street of the market town
were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a
cornchandler and seedsman should be </s>
<s>  it appeared to me that he must be a
very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop </s>
<s>  and
i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the
tiedup brown paper packets inside whether the flowerseeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom </s>
<s> 

it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this
speculation </s>
<s>  on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows </s>
<s>  in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook wore corduroys and so did
his shopman </s>
<s>  and somehow there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavor
about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew
which was which </s>
<s>  the same opportunity served me for noticing that <abvr>
pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the
street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping
his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his
hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded
his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist </s>
<s>  the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with
a magnifyingglass at his eye and always inspected by a group of
smockfrocks poring over him through the glass of his shopwindow
seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade
engaged his attention </s>

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight oclock in the parlor behind
the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread
and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises </s>
<s>  i considered <abvr>
pumblechook wretched company </s>
<s>  besides being possessed by my sisters
idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted
to my dietbesides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into
my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
altogetherhis conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic </s>

my politely bidding him good morning he said pompously seven times
nine boy </s>

a strange place on an empty stomach </s>

may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner </s>
<s> 

for such reasons i was very glad when ten oclock came and we started
for miss havishams </s>
<s>  though i was not at all at my ease regarding the
manner in which i should acquit myself under that ladys roof </s>
<s>  within
a quarter of an hour we came to miss havishams house which was of old
brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it </s>
<s>  some of the
windows had been walled up </s>
<s>  of those that remained all the lower were
rustily barred </s>
<s>  there was a courtyard in front and that was barred </s>
<s>  so
we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come
to open it </s>
<s>  while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then <abvr>
pumblechook said and fourteen </s>
<s>  but i pretended not to hear him and
saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery </s>
<s>  no brewing
was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long
time </s>
<s> 

a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name </s>
<s>  to which my
conductor replied pumblechook </s>
<s>  the voice returned quite right and
the window was shut again and a young lady came across the courtyard
with keys in her hand </s>
<s> 

this said <abvr> pumblechook is pip </s>

this is pip is it </s>

seemed very proud </s>

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate </s>
<s> 

oh </s>

<s> 

if miss havisham wished to see me returned <abvr> pumblechook
discomfited </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>  but you see she dont </s>
<s> 

she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that <abvr>
pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not
protest </s>
<s>  but he eyed me severelyas if i had done anything to
him </s>
<s> and departed with the words reproachfully delivered </s>

<s>  let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand </s>
<s> 
 i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound
through the gate and sixteen </s>
<s>  but he didnt </s>
<s> 

my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard </s>
<s> 
it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice </s>
<s>  the
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood
open away to the high enclosing wall </s>
<s>  and all was empty and disused </s>
<s> 
the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate </s>
<s>  and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea </s>
<s> 

she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt
all the strong beer thats brewed there now boy </s>
<s> 

i should think i could miss said i in a shy way </s>
<s> 

better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy </s>
<s> 
dont you think so </s>

it looks like it miss </s>
<s> 

not that anybody means to try she added for thats all done with

<s>  as to strong
beer theres enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor
house </s>

is that the name of this house miss </s>

one of its names boy </s>

it has more than one then miss </s>

one more </s>

hebrew or all threeor all one to mefor enough </s>
<s> 

enough house said i </s>
<s>  thats a curious name miss </s>
<s> 

yes she replied </s>
<s>  but it meant more than it said </s>
<s>  it meant when it
was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else </s>
<s>  they
must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think </s>
<s>  but dont
loiter boy </s>
<s> 

though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary she was of about my own age </s>
<s>  she seemed much
older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and selfpossessed </s>
<s> 
and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneandtwenty and a
queen </s>
<s> 

we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two
chains across it outsideand the first thing i noticed was that the
passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there </s>
<s> 
she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase
and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us </s>
<s> 

at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in </s>
<s> 

i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss </s>
<s> 

to this she returned </s>
<s>  dont be ridiculous boy </s>
<s>  i am not going in </s>
<s>  and
scornfully walked away andwhat was worsetook the candle with her </s>
<s> 

this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid </s>
<s>  however the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told
from within to enter </s>
<s>  i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty
large room well lighted with wax candles </s>
<s>  no glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it </s>
<s>  it was a dressingroom as i supposed from the furniture
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me </s>
<s>  but
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookingglass and that
i made out at first sight to be a fine ladys dressingtable </s>
<s> 

whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it i cannot say </s>
<s>  in an armchair with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the
strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see </s>
<s> 

she was dressed in rich materialssatins and lace and silksall
of white </s>
<s>  her shoes were white </s>
<s>  and she had a long white veil dependent
from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was
white </s>
<s>  some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table </s>
<s>  dresses less splendid
than the dress she wore and halfpacked trunks were scattered about </s>
<s> 
she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe onthe
other was on the table near her handher veil was but half arranged
her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay
with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and
some flowers and a prayerbook all confusedly heaped about the
lookingglass </s>
<s> 

it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though
i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed </s>
<s>  but i
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been
white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow </s>
<s>  i saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and
like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her
sunken eyes </s>
<s>  i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone </s>
<s>  once i had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage
lying in state </s>
<s>  once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement </s>
<s>  now waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me </s>
<s>  i should have cried out if
i could </s>
<s> 

who is it </s>
<s>  said the lady at the table </s>
<s> 

pip maam </s>
<s> 

pip </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechooks boy maam </s>
<s>  cometo play </s>
<s> 

come nearer </s>
<s>  let me look at you </s>
<s>  come close </s>
<s> 

it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of
the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

look at me said miss havisham </s>
<s>  you are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born </s>
<s> 

i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer no </s>
<s> 

do you know what i touch here </s>
<s>  she said laying her hands one upon
the other on her left side </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  it made me think of the young man </s>
<s> 

what do i touch </s>
<s> 

your heart </s>
<s> 

broken </s>
<s> 

she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it </s>
<s>  afterwards she kept
her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy </s>
<s> 

i am tired said miss havisham </s>
<s>  i want diversion and i have done
with men and women </s>
<s>  play </s>
<s> 

i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances </s>
<s> 

i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy
that i want to see some play </s>
<s>  there there </s>
<s>  with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her right hand </s>
<s>  play play play </s>
<s> 

for a moment with the fear of my sisters working me before my eyes i
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of <abvr> pumblechooks chaisecart </s>
<s>  but i felt myself so unequal to the
performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in
what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when
we had taken a good look at each other

are you sullen and obstinate </s>
<s> 

no maam i am very sorry for you and very sorry i cant play just
now </s>
<s>  if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so
i would do it if i could </s>
<s>  but its so new here and so strange and so
fineand melancholy </s>
<s>  i stopped fearing i might say too much or
had already said it and we took another look at each other </s>
<s> 

before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the
dress she wore and at the dressingtable and finally at herself in the
lookingglass </s>
<s> 

so new to him she muttered so old to me </s>
<s>  so strange to him so
familiar to me </s>
<s>  so melancholy to both of us </s>
<s>  call estella </s>
<s> 

as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was
still talking to herself and kept quiet </s>
<s> 

call estella she repeated flashing a look at me </s>
<s>  you can do that </s>
<s> 
call estella </s>
<s>  at the door </s>
<s> 

to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house
bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost
as bad as playing to order </s>
<s>  but she answered at last and her light came
along the dark passage like a star </s>
<s> 

miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the
table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
pretty brown hair </s>
<s>  your own one day my dear and you will use it
well </s>
<s>  let me see you play cards with this boy </s>
<s> 

with this boy </s>
<s>  why he is a common laboring boy </s>
<s> 

i thought i overheard miss havisham answeronly it seemed so
unlikelywell </s>
<s>  you can break his heart </s>
<s> 

what do you play boy </s>
<s>  asked estella of myself with the greatest
disdain </s>
<s> 

nothing but beggar my neighbor miss </s>
<s> 

beggar him said miss havisham to estella </s>
<s>  so we sat down to cards </s>
<s> 

it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago </s>
<s>  i noticed that
miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had
taken it up </s>
<s>  as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressingtable
again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never
been worn </s>
<s>  i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent
and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been
trodden ragged </s>
<s>  without this arrest of everything this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like graveclothes or the long
veil so like a shroud </s>
<s> 

so she sat corpselike as we played at cards </s>
<s>  the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper </s>
<s>  i knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen </s>
<s>  but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust </s>
<s> 

he calls the knaves jacks this boy </s>
<s>  said estella with disdain before
our first game was out </s>
<s>  and what coarse hands he has </s>
<s>  and what thick
boots </s>
<s> 

i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before </s>
<s>  but i began
to consider them a very indifferent pair </s>
<s>  her contempt for me was so
strong that it became infectious and i caught it </s>
<s> 

she won the game and i dealt </s>
<s>  i misdealt as was only natural when i
knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong </s>
<s>  and she denounced me for
a stupid clumsy laboringboy </s>
<s> 

you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked
on </s>
<s>  she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her </s>
<s>  what
do you think of her </s>
<s> 

i dont like to say i stammered </s>
<s> 

tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down </s>
<s> 

i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think she is very pretty </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think she is very insulting </s>
<s>  she was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think i should like to go home </s>
<s> 

and never see her again though she is so pretty </s>
<s> 

i am not sure that i shouldnt like to see her again but i should like
to go home now </s>
<s> 

you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud </s>
<s>  play the game out </s>
<s> 

saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost
sure that miss havishams face could not smile </s>
<s>  it had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expressionmost likely when all the things about
her had become transfixedand it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again </s>
<s>  her chest had dropped so that she stooped </s>
<s>  and her voice
had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her </s>
<s> 
altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul
within and without under the weight of a crushing blow </s>
<s> 

i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me </s>
<s>  she
threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she
despised them for having been won of me </s>
<s> 

when shall i have you here again </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  let me think </s>
<s> 

i was beginning to remind her that today was wednesday when she
checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her
right hand </s>
<s> 

there there </s>
<s>  i know nothing of days of the week </s>
<s>  i know nothing of
weeks of the year </s>
<s>  come again after six days </s>
<s>  you hear </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s> 

estella take him down </s>
<s>  let him have something to eat and let him roam
and look about him while he eats </s>
<s>  go pip </s>
<s> 

i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she
stood it in the place where we had found it </s>
<s>  until she opened the
side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must
necessarily be nighttime </s>
<s>  the rush of the daylight quite confounded me
and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours </s>
<s> 

you are to wait here you boy said estella </s>
<s>  and disappeared and
closed the door </s>
<s> 

i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots </s>
<s>  my opinion of those accessories was
not favorable </s>
<s>  they had never troubled me before but they troubled
me now as vulgar appendages </s>
<s>  i determined to ask joe why he had ever
taught me to call those picturecards jacks which ought to be called
knaves </s>
<s>  i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then
i should have been so too </s>
<s> 

she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer </s>
<s>  she
put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in
disgrace </s>
<s>  i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorryi
cannot hit upon the right name for the smartgod knows what its name
wasthat tears started to my eyes </s>
<s>  the moment they sprang there the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them </s>
<s> 
this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her </s>
<s>  so she gave a
contemptuous tossbut with a sense i thought of having made too sure
that i was so woundedand left me </s>
<s> 

but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face
in and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried </s>
<s> 
as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair </s>
<s>  so
bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that
needed counteraction </s>
<s> 

my sisters bringing up had made me sensitive </s>
<s>  in the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice </s>
<s>  it may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to </s>
<s>  but the child
is small and its world is small and its rockinghorse stands as many
hands high according to scale as a bigboned irish hunter </s>
<s>  within
myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with
injustice </s>
<s>  i had known from the time when i could speak that my
sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me </s>
<s>  i had
cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her
no right to bring me up by jerks </s>
<s>  through all my punishments disgraces
fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed
this assurance </s>
<s>  and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and
unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid
and very sensitive </s>
<s> 

i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my
face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate </s>
<s>  the bread and meat
were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon
in spirits to look about me </s>
<s> 

to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonhouse in the
breweryyard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it </s>
<s>  but there were no pigeons
in the dovecot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in
the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat </s>
<s> 
all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke </s>
<s>  in a byyard there was a wilderness of empty casks
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them </s>
<s>  but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was goneand in this respect i remember those recluses as being like
most others </s>
<s> 

behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old
wall </s>
<s>  not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked
there and that estella was walking away from me even then </s>
<s>  but she
seemed to be everywhere </s>
<s>  for when i yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks </s>
<s>  she had her back towards me and held her
pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round
and passed out of my view directly </s>
<s>  so in the brewery itselfby which
i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer
and where the brewing utensils still were </s>
<s>  when i first went into it
and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about
me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light
iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going
out into the sky </s>
<s> 

it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened
to my fancy </s>
<s>  i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards </s>
<s>  i turned my eyesa little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure
hanging there by the neck </s>
<s>  a figure all in yellow white with but
one shoe to the feet </s>
<s>  and it hung so that i could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was
miss havishams with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she were trying to call to me </s>
<s>  in the terror of seeing the figure
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it </s>
<s>  and my terror
was greatest of all when i found no figure there </s>
<s> 

nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought
me round </s>
<s>  even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon
as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let
me out </s>
<s>  she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i
thought if she saw me frightened </s>
<s>  and she would have no fair reason </s>

she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the
gate and stood holding it </s>

<s> 

why dont you cry </s>

because i dont want to </s>

you do said she </s>

i went straight to <abvr> pumblechooks and was immensely relieved to find

<s> 
that my boots were thick </s>

chapter ix

when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss
havishams and asked a number of questions </s>
<s>  and i soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length </s>
<s> 

if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in minewhich i consider probable as i have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosityit is the key to many
reservations </s>
<s>  i felt convinced that if i described miss havishams as my
eyes had seen it i should not be understood </s>
<s>  not only that but i felt
convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood </s>
<s>  and although
she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before the
contemplation of <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  consequently i said as little as i could
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall </s>
<s> 

the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came
gaping over in his chaisecart at teatime to have the details divulged
to him </s>
<s>  and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth
open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence </s>
<s> 

well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire </s>
<s>  how did you get on up town </s>
<s> 

i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me </s>
<s> 

pretty well </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook repeated </s>
<s>  pretty well is no answer </s>
<s>  tell
us what you mean by pretty well boy </s>
<s> 

whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps </s>
<s>  anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my
obstinacy was adamantine </s>
<s>  i reflected for some time and then answered
as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well </s>
<s> 

my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at mei
had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forgewhen <abvr>
pumblechook interposed with no </s>
<s>  dont lose your temper </s>
<s>  leave this
lad to me maam </s>
<s>  leave this lad to me </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook then turned me
towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said

first to get our thoughts in order </s>
<s>  fortythree pence </s>
<s> 

i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and
finding them against me went as near the answer as i couldwhich was
somewhere about eightpence off </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook then put me through my
pencetable from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence
make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had
done for me now </s>
<s>  how much is fortythree pence </s>
<s>  to which i replied
after a long interval of reflection i dont know </s>
<s>  and i was so
aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me
and said is fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for
instance </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and
brought him to a dead stop </s>
<s> 

boy </s>
<s>  what like is miss havisham </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook began again when
he had recovered </s>
<s>  folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the
screw </s>
<s> 

very tall and dark i told him </s>
<s> 

is she uncle </s>
<s>  asked my sister </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook winked assent </s>
<s>  from which i at once inferred that he had
never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook conceitedly </s>
<s>  this is the way to have him </s>
<s> 
we are beginning to hold our own i think mum </s>
<s> 

i am sure uncle returned <abvr> joe i wish you had him always </s>
<s>  you
know so well how to deal with him </s>
<s> 

now boy </s>
<s>  what was she a doing of when you went in today </s>
<s>  asked <abvr>
pumblechook </s>
<s> 

she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook and <abvr> joe stared at one anotheras they well
mightand both repeated in a black velvet coach </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s>  and miss estellathats her niece i thinkhanded her
in cake and wine at the coachwindow on a gold plate </s>
<s>  and we all had
cake and wine on gold plates </s>
<s>  and i got up behind the coach to eat mine
because she told me to </s>
<s> 

was anybody else there </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

four dogs said i </s>
<s> 

large or small </s>
<s> 

immense said i </s>
<s>  and they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver
basket </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook and <abvr> joe stared at one another again in utter
amazement </s>
<s>  i was perfectly frantica reckless witness under the
tortureand would have told them anything </s>
<s> 

where was this coach in the name of gracious </s>
<s>  asked my sister </s>
<s> 

in miss havishams room </s>
<s>  they stared again </s>
<s>  but there werent any
horses to it </s>
<s>  i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of
harnessing </s>
<s> 

can this be possible uncle </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  what can the boy mean </s>
<s> 

ill tell you mum said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s>  my opinion is its a
sedanchair </s>
<s>  shes flighty you knowvery flightyquite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedanchair </s>
<s> 

did you ever see her in it uncle </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> joe </s>
<s> 

how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see
her in my life </s>
<s>  never clapped eyes upon her </s>
<s> 

goodness uncle </s>
<s>  and yet you have spoken to her </s>
<s> 

why dont you know said <abvr> pumblechook testily that when i have
been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door
has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way </s>
<s>  dont say you dont
know that mum </s>
<s>  howsever the boy went there to play </s>
<s>  what did you play
at boy </s>
<s> 

we played with flags i said </s>
<s>  i beg to observe that i think of myself
with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion </s>
<s> 

flags </s>
<s>  echoed my sister </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s>  estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and
miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out
at the coachwindow </s>
<s>  and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed </s>
<s> 

swords </s>
<s>  repeated my sister </s>
<s>  where did you get swords from </s>
<s> 

out of a cupboard said i </s>
<s>  and i saw pistols in itand jamand
pills </s>
<s>  and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up
with candles </s>
<s> 

thats true mum said <abvr> pumblechook with a grave nod </s>
<s>  thats the
state of the case for that much ive seen myself </s>
<s>  and then they
both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand </s>
<s> 

if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery </s>
<s>  they were so much occupied however in discussing the
marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped </s>
<s> 
the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup
of tea </s>
<s>  to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for
the gratification of his related my pretended experiences </s>
<s> 

now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence </s>
<s>  but only as
regarded himnot in the least as regarded the other two </s>
<s>  towards
joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat
debating what results would come to me from miss havishams acquaintance
and favor </s>
<s>  they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something
 for me </s>
<s>  their doubts related to the form that something would take </s>
<s> 
my sister stood out for property </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel tradesay
the corn and seed trade for instance </s>
<s>  joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealcutlets </s>
<s> 
if a fools head cant express better opinions than that said my
sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it </s>
<s> 
 so he went </s>
<s> 

after <abvr> pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up
i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for
the night </s>
<s>  then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to
tell you something </s>
<s> 

should you pip </s>
<s>  said joe drawing his shoeingstool near the forge </s>
<s> 
then tell us </s>
<s>  what is it pip </s>
<s> 

joe said i taking hold of his rolledup shirt sleeve and twisting
it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss
havishams </s>
<s> 

remember </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  i believe you </s>
<s>  wonderful </s>
<s> 

its a terrible thing joe </s>
<s>  it aint true </s>
<s> 

what are you telling of pip </s>
<s>  cried joe falling back in the greatest
amazement </s>
<s>  you dont mean to say its

yes i do </s>
<s>  its lies joe </s>
<s> 

but not all of it </s>
<s>  why sure you dont mean to say pip that there was
no black welwet coeh </s>
<s>  for i stood shaking my head </s>
<s>  but at least
there was dogs pip </s>
<s>  come pip said joe persuasively if there
warnt no wealcutlets at least there was dogs </s>
<s> 

no joe </s>
<s> 

a dog </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  a puppy </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

no joe there was nothing at all of the kind </s>
<s> 

as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay </s>
<s> 
pip old chap </s>
<s>  this wont do old fellow </s>
<s>  i say </s>
<s>  where do you expect to
go to </s>
<s> 

its terrible joe </s>
<s>  aint it </s>
<s> 

terrible </s>
<s>  cried joe </s>
<s>  awful </s>
<s>  what possessed you </s>
<s> 

i dont know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt
sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head </s>
<s> 
but i wish you hadnt taught me to call knaves at cards jacks </s>
<s>  and i
wish my boots werent so thick nor my hands so coarse </s>
<s> 

and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadnt been
able to explain myself to <abvr> joe and pumblechook who were so rude to
me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havishams
who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i
knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies
had come of it somehow though i didnt know how </s>
<s> 

this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal
with as for me </s>
<s>  but joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics and by that means vanquished it </s>
<s> 

theres one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some
rumination namely that lies is lies </s>
<s>  howsever they come they didnt
ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to
the same </s>
<s>  dont you tell no more of �em pip </s>
<s>  that aint the way to get
out of being common old chap </s>
<s>  and as to being common i dont make
it out at all clear </s>
<s>  you are oncommon in some things </s>
<s>  youre oncommon
small </s>
<s>  likewise youre a oncommon scholar </s>
<s> 

no i am ignorant and backward joe </s>
<s> 

why see what a letter you wrote last night </s>
<s>  wrote in print even </s>
<s>  ive
seen lettersah </s>
<s>  and from gentlefolks </s>
<s> that ill swear werent wrote

<s> 

i have learnt next to nothing joe </s>
<s>  you think much of me </s>
<s>  its only
that </s>
<s> 

well pip said joe be it so or be it sont you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope </s>
<s>  the king upon
his throne with his crown upon his ed cant sit and write his acts
of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted
prince with the alphabet </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  added joe with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z </s>
<s> 
and i know what that is to do though i cant say ive exactly done it </s>
<s> 

there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged
me </s>
<s> 

whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe
reflectively mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon
oneswhich reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps </s>
<s> 

no joe </s>
<s> 

im sorry there werent a flag pip </s>
<s>  whether that might be or
mightnt be is a thing as cant be looked into now without putting
your sister on the rampage </s>
<s>  and thats a thing not to be thought of as
being done intentional </s>
<s>  lookee here pip at what is said to you by a
true friend </s>
<s>  which this to you the true friend say </s>
<s>  if you cant get to
be oncommon through going straight youll never get to do it through
going crooked </s>
<s>  so dont tell no more on �em pip and live well and die
happy </s>
<s> 

you are not angry with me joe </s>

no old chap </s>

wealcutlets and dogfightinga sincere wellwisher would adwise pip
their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed </s>
<s> 
thats all old chap and dont never do it no more </s>
<s> 

when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget
joes recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common
estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith </s>
<s>  how thick his boots and
how coarse his hands </s>
<s>  i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how
miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the
level of such common doings </s>
<s>  i fell asleep recalling what i used to
do when i was at miss havishams </s>
<s>  as though i had been there weeks or
months instead of hours </s>
<s>  and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day </s>
<s> 

that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me </s>
<s>  but it
is the same with any life </s>
<s>  imagine one selected day struck out of it
and think how different its course would have been </s>
<s>  pause you who read

chapter x

the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke
that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of biddy everything she knew </s>
<s>  in pursuance of this luminous
conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to <abvr> wopsles greataunts
at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life
and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart
all her learning to me </s>
<s>  biddy who was the most obliging of girls
immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise
within five minutes </s>
<s> 

the educational scheme or course established by <abvr> wopsles greataunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis </s>
<s>  the pupils ate apples
and put straws down one anothers backs until <abvr> wopsles greataunt
collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birchrod </s>
<s>  after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand </s>
<s>  the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and
a little spellingthat is to say it had had once </s>
<s>  as soon as this
volume began to circulate <abvr> wopsles greataunt fell into a state of
coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm </s>
<s>  the pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes </s>
<s>  this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with
speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves </s>
<s>  this part of the course was
usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory
students </s>
<s>  when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a
page and then we all read aloud what we couldor what we couldntin
a frightful chorus </s>
<s>  biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice
and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we
were reading about </s>
<s>  when this horrible din had lasted a certain time
it mechanically awoke <abvr> wopsles greataunt who staggered at a boy
fortuitously and pulled his ears </s>
<s>  this was understood to terminate
the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory </s>
<s>  it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupils entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holdenand which was also <abvr> wopsles
greataunts sittingroom and bedchamberbeing but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle and no snuffers </s>
<s> 

it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under
these circumstances </s>
<s>  nevertheless i resolved to try it and that
very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some
information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist
sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d which she
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed
until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle </s>
<s> 

of course there was a publichouse in the village and of course joe
liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there </s>
<s>  i had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that
evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril </s>
<s>  to the
three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps </s>
<s> 

there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to
be never paid off </s>
<s>  they had been there ever since i could remember and
had grown more than i had </s>
<s>  but there was a quantity of chalk about our
country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account </s>
<s> 

it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records </s>
<s>  but as my business was with joe and not with him i
merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire
and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with <abvr> wopsle and a
stranger </s>
<s>  joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap </s>
<s>  and the
moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me </s>
<s> 

he was a secretlooking man whom i had never seen before </s>
<s>  his head was
all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun </s>
<s>  he had a pipe in his
mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time nodded </s>
<s>  so i nodded and then he
nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit
down there </s>
<s> 

but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of
resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made
for me on the opposite settle </s>
<s>  the strange man after glancing at joe
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again
when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his legin a very odd way as
it struck me </s>
<s> 

you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a
blacksmith </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i said it you know said joe </s>
<s> 

whatll you drink <abvr> </s>
<s>  you didnt mention your name by the bye </s>
<s> 

joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it </s>
<s>  whatll you

<s>  to top up with </s>
<s> 

well said joe to tell you the truth i aint much in the habit of
drinking at anybodys expense but my own </s>
<s>

<s>  no returned the stranger but once and away and on a
saturday night too </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  put a name to it <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

i wouldnt wish to be stiff company said joe </s>
<s>  rum </s>
<s> 

rum repeated the stranger </s>
<s>  and will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment </s>
<s> 

rum said <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

three rums </s>
<s>  cried the stranger calling to the landlord </s>
<s>  glasses
round </s>
<s> 

this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing <abvr> wopsle
is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out </s>
<s>  our clerk at
church </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me </s>
<s>  the
lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it </s>
<s> 

thats it said joe </s>
<s> 

the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself </s>
<s>  he wore a flapping
broadbrimmed travellers hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his
head in the manner of a cap </s>
<s>  so that he showed no hair </s>
<s>  as he looked
at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a
halflaugh come into his face </s>
<s> 

i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a
solitary country towards the river </s>
<s> 

most marshes is solitary said joe </s>
<s> 

no doubt no doubt </s>
<s>  do you find any gypsies now or tramps or
vagrants of any sort out there </s>
<s> 

no said joe </s>
<s>  none but a runaway convict now and then </s>
<s>  and we dont
find them easy </s>
<s>  eh <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented </s>
<s> 
but not warmly </s>
<s> 

seems you have been out after such </s>
<s>  asked the stranger </s>
<s> 

once returned joe </s>
<s>  not that we wanted to take them you understand </s>
<s> 
we went out as lookers on </s>
<s>  me and <abvr> wopsle and pip </s>
<s>  didnt us pip </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s> 

the stranger looked at me againstill cocking his eye as if he were

pip said joe </s>

no not christened pip </s>

no said joe its a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
infant and is called by </s>
<s> 

son of yours </s>
<s> 

well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at
the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipeswellno </s>
<s>  no he aint </s>
<s> 

nevvy </s>
<s>  said the strange man </s>
<s> 

well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he
is notno not to deceive you he is notmy nevvy </s>
<s> 

what the blue blazes is he </s>
<s>  asked the stranger </s>
<s>  which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle struck in upon that </s>
<s>  as one who knew all about relationships
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry </s>
<s>  and expounded the ties between me and joe </s>
<s>  having
his hand in <abvr> wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite
enough to account for it when he added as the poet says </s>
<s> 

and here i may remark that when <abvr> wopsle referred to me he considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes </s>
<s>  i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances </s>
<s>  yet i do not call to mind that i
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle but some largehanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me </s>
<s> 

all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at
me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me
down </s>
<s>  but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation
until the glasses of rum and water were brought </s>
<s>  and then he made his
shot and a most extraordinary shot it was </s>
<s> 

it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbshow and was
pointedly addressed to me </s>
<s>  he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me
and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me </s>
<s>  and he stirred it and
he tasted it </s>
<s>  not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file </s>
<s> 

he did this so that nobody but i saw the file </s>
<s>  and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket </s>
<s>  i knew it to be
joes file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the
instrument </s>
<s>  i sat gazing at him spellbound </s>
<s>  but he now reclined on his
settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about
turnips </s>
<s> 

there was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which
stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays

<s>  the halfhour and the rum and water running out
together joe got up to go and took me by the hand </s>
<s> 

stop half a moment <abvr> gargery said the strange man </s>
<s>  i think ive
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy
shall have it </s>
<s> 

he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some
crumpled paper and gave it to me </s>
<s>  yours </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  your own </s>
<s> 

i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners
and holding tight to joe </s>
<s>  he gave joe goodnight and he gave <abvr> wopsle
goodnight who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his
aiming eyeno not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it </s>
<s> 

on the way home if i had been in a humor for talking the talk must
have been all on my side for <abvr> wopsle parted from us at the door of
the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible </s>
<s>  but i was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance and could think of nothing else </s>
<s> 

my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her about the bright shilling </s>
<s>  a bad un ill be bound said <abvr> joe
triumphantly or he wouldnt have given it to the boy </s>
<s>  lets look at
it </s>
<s> 

i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one </s>
<s>  but whats
this </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper </s>
<s>  two onepound notes </s>
<s> 

nothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets in
the county </s>
<s>  joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly
bargemen to restore them to their owner </s>
<s>  while he was gone i sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there </s>
<s> 

presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he
joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes </s>
<s> 
then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under
some dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor </s>
<s>  there they remained a nightmare to me many and many
a night and day </s>
<s> 

i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with

<s> 
i was haunted by the file too </s>
<s>  a dread possessed me that when i least
expected it the file would reappear </s>
<s>  i coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of miss havishams next wednesday </s>

the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i
screamed myself awake </s>

chapter xi

at the appointed time i returned to miss havishams and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out estella </s>
<s>  she locked it after admitting
me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her candle stood </s>
<s>  she took no notice of me until she had the
candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously
saying you are to come this way today and took me to quite another
part of the house </s>
<s> 

the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the manor house </s>
<s>  we traversed but one side of the square
however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and
opened a door </s>
<s>  here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in
a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwellinghouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery </s>
<s>  there was a clock in the
outer wall of this house </s>
<s>  like the clock in miss havishams room and
like miss havishams watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling on the groundfloor at the back </s>
<s>  there was some company in
the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and
stand there boy till you are wanted </s>
<s>  there being the window i
crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind
looking out </s>
<s> 

it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks and one boxtree
that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new
growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different color as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt </s>
<s>  this
was my homely thought as i contemplated the boxtree </s>
<s>  there had been
some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge </s>
<s> 
but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window
as if it pelted me for coming there </s>
<s> 

i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that
its other occupants were looking at me </s>
<s>  i could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the windowglass but i stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection </s>
<s> 

there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman </s>
<s>  before i had been
standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs </s>
<s>  because the admission
that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady
and humbug </s>
<s> 

they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodys pleasure
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn </s>
<s>  this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded
me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found
when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features </s>
<s>  indeed when
i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features
at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face </s>
<s> 

poor dear soul </s>
<s>  said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my
sisters </s>
<s>  nobodys enemy but his own </s>
<s> 

it would be much more commendable to be somebody elses enemy said
the gentleman </s>
<s>  far more natural </s>
<s> 

cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbor </s>
<s> 

sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own
neighbor who is </s>
<s> 

miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn
the idea </s>
<s>  but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too </s>
<s>  the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and
emphatically very true </s>
<s> 

poor soul </s>
<s>  camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time he is so very strange </s>
<s>  would anyone believe
that when toms wife died he actually could not be induced to see the
importance of the childrens having the deepest of trimmings to their
mourning </s>
<s>  �good lord </s>
<s>  says he �camilla what can it signify so long
as the poor bereaved little things are in black </s>
<s>  so like matthew </s>
<s>  the
idea </s>
<s> 

good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond </s>
<s>  heaven
forbid i should deny good points in him </s>
<s>  but he never had and he never
will have any sense of the proprieties </s>
<s> 

you know i was obliged said camillai was obliged to be firm </s>
<s>  i
said �it will not do for the credit of the family </s>
<s>  i told him that
without deep trimmings the family was disgraced </s>
<s>  i cried about it from
breakfast till dinner </s>
<s>  i injured my digestion </s>
<s>  and at last he flung out
in his violent way and said with a d �then do as you like </s>
<s>  thank
goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly
went out in a pouring rain and bought the things </s>
<s> 

he paid for them did he not </s>
<s>  asked estella </s>
<s> 

its not the question my dear child who paid for them returned
camilla </s>
<s>  i bought them </s>
<s>  and i shall often think of that with peace
when i wake up in the night </s>
<s> 

the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation
and caused estella to say to me now boy </s>
<s>  on my turning round they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard
sarah pocket say well i am sure </s>
<s>  what next </s>
<s>  and camilla add with
indignation was there ever such a fancy </s>
<s>  the idea </s>
<s> 

as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped
all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with
her face quite close to mine

well </s>
<s> 

well miss </s>
<s>  i answered almost falling over her and checking myself </s>
<s> 

she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her </s>
<s> 

am i pretty </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i think you are very pretty </s>
<s> 

am i insulting </s>
<s> 

not so much so as you were last time said i </s>
<s> 

not so much so </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with
such force as she had when i answered it </s>
<s> 

now </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  you little coarse monster what do you think of me
now </s>
<s> 

i shall not tell you </s>
<s> 

because you are going to tell upstairs </s>
<s>  is that it </s>
<s> 

no said i thats not it </s>
<s> 

why dont you cry again you little wretch </s>
<s> 

because ill never cry for you again said i </s>
<s>  which was i suppose as
false a declaration as ever was made </s>
<s>  for i was inwardly crying for her
then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards </s>
<s> 

we went on our way upstairs after this episode </s>
<s>  and as we were going
up we met a gentleman groping his way down </s>
<s> 

whom have we here </s>
<s>  asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me </s>
<s> 

a boy said estella </s>
<s> 

he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an
exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand </s>
<s>  he took my chin
in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle </s>
<s>  he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling </s>
<s> 
his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious </s>
<s>  he had a large watchchain and strong black dots where his
beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them </s>
<s>  he was nothing
to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be
anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing
him well </s>
<s> 

boy of the neighborhood </s>
<s>  hey </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

yes sir said i </s>
<s> 

how do you come here </s>
<s> 

miss havisham sent for me sir i explained </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  behave yourself </s>
<s>  i have a pretty large experience of boys and
youre a bad set of fellows </s>
<s>  now mind </s>
<s>  said he biting the side of his
great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself </s>
<s> 

with those words he released mewhich i was glad of for his hand
smelt of scented soapand went his way downstairs </s>
<s>  i wondered whether
he could be a doctor </s>
<s>  but no i thought </s>
<s>  he couldnt be a doctor or he
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner </s>
<s>  there was not much time
to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havishams room where
she and everything else were just as i had left them </s>
<s>  estella left me
standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her
eyes upon me from the dressingtable </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  she said without being startled or surprised </s>
<s>  the days have worn
away have they </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  today is

there there there </s>
<s>  with the impatient movement of her fingers </s>
<s>  i
dont want to know </s>
<s>  are you ready to play </s>
<s> 

i was obliged to answer in some confusion i dont think i am maam </s>
<s> 

not at cards again </s>
<s>  she demanded with a searching look </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  i could do that if i was wanted </s>
<s> 

since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham
impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work </s>
<s> 

i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to
find for the other question and i said i was quite willing </s>
<s> 

then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind
me with her withered hand and wait there till i come </s>
<s> 

i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated </s>
<s> 
from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive </s>
<s>  a fire had been lately kindled in
the damp oldfashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer airlike our own marsh mist </s>
<s>  certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber </s>
<s>  or it
would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness </s>
<s>  it was
spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces </s>
<s>  the
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together </s>
<s>  an epergne or centrepiece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth </s>
<s>  it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable </s>
<s>  and as i looked along the yellow
expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black
fungus i saw specklelegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community </s>
<s> 

i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests </s>
<s>  but the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way as if they were shortsighted and hard of hearing and not
on terms with one another </s>
<s> 

these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching
them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder </s>
<s> 
in her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned and
she looked like the witch of the place </s>
<s> 

this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i
will be laid when i am dead </s>
<s>  they shall come and look at me here </s>
<s> 

with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and
there and die at once the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the fair i shrank under her touch </s>
<s> 

what do you think that is </s>
<s>  she asked me again pointing with her
stick </s>
<s>  that where those cobwebs are </s>
<s> 

i cant guess what it is maam </s>
<s> 

its a great cake </s>
<s>  a bridecake </s>
<s>  mine </s>
<s> 

she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come </s>
<s> 
walk me walk me </s>
<s> 

i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss
havisham round and round the room </s>
<s>  accordingly i started at once and
she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of <abvr>
pumblechooks chaisecart </s>
<s> 

she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower </s>
<s> 
 still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast </s>
<s>  after a
while she said call estella </s>
<s>  so i went out on the landing and
roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion </s>
<s>  when her light
appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round
and round the room </s>
<s> 

if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should
have felt sufficiently discontented </s>
<s>  but as she brought with her the
three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didnt know
what to do </s>
<s>  in my politeness i would have stopped </s>
<s>  but miss
havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted onwith a shamefaced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing </s>
<s> 

dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket </s>
<s>  how well you look </s>
<s> 

i do not returned miss havisham </s>
<s>  i am yellow skin and bone </s>
<s> 

camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff </s>
<s>  and she
murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear
soul </s>
<s>  certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing </s>
<s>  the idea </s>
<s> 

and how are you </s>
<s>  said miss havisham to camilla </s>
<s>  as we were close to
camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss
havisham wouldnt stop </s>
<s>  we swept on and i felt that i was highly
obnoxious to camilla </s>
<s> 

thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be
expected </s>
<s> 

why whats the matter with you </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham with exceeding
sharpness </s>
<s> 

nothing worth mentioning replied camilla </s>
<s>  i dont wish to make a
display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the
night than i am quite equal to </s>
<s> 

then dont think of me retorted miss havisham </s>
<s> 

very easily said </s>
<s>  remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a
hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed </s>
<s>  raymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night </s>
<s> 
raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs </s>
<s>  chokings
and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with
anxiety of those i love </s>
<s>  if i could be less affectionate and sensitive
i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves </s>
<s>  i am sure
i wish it could be so </s>
<s>  but as to not thinking of you in the nightthe
idea </s>
<s>  here a burst of tears </s>
<s> 

the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and
him i understood to be <abvr> camilla </s>
<s>  he came to the rescue at this point
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other </s>
<s> 

i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but
once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person my dear </s>
<s> 

miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated
old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnutshells
and a large mouth like a cats without the whiskers supported this
position by saying no indeed my dear </s>
<s>  hem </s>
<s> 

thinking is easy enough said the grave lady </s>
<s> 

what is easier you know </s>
<s>  assented miss sarah pocket </s>
<s> 

oh yes yes </s>
<s>  cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her legs to her bosom </s>
<s>  its all very true </s>
<s>  its a weakness
to be so affectionate but i cant help it </s>
<s>  no doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise still i wouldnt change my disposition
if i could </s>
<s>  its the cause of much suffering but its a consolation to
know i posses it when i wake up in the night </s>
<s>  here another burst of
feeling </s>
<s> 

miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going
round and round the room </s>
<s>  now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber </s>
<s> 

theres matthew </s>
<s>  said camilla </s>
<s>  never mixing with any natural ties
never coming here to see how miss havisham is </s>
<s>  i have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head
over the side and my hair all down and my feet i dont know where

much higher than your head my love said <abvr> camilla </s>
<s> 

i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of
matthews strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me </s>
<s> 

really i must say i should think not </s>
<s>  interposed the grave lady </s>
<s> 

you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious
personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to
thank you my love </s>
<s> 

without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed
camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond
is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the pianoforte
tuners across the street where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distanceand now to be told
 here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there </s>
<s> 

when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and
herself and stood looking at the speaker </s>
<s>  this change had a great
influence in bringing camillas chemistry to a sudden end </s>
<s> 

matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly
when i am laid on that table </s>
<s>  that will be his placethere striking
the table with her stick at my head </s>
<s>  and yours will be there </s>
<s>  and your
husbands there </s>
<s>  and sarah pockets there </s>
<s>  and georgianas there </s>
<s>  now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me </s>
<s> 
and now go </s>
<s> 

at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in
a new place </s>
<s>  she now said walk me walk me </s>
<s>  and we went on again </s>
<s> 

i suppose theres nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply
and depart </s>
<s>  its something to have seen the object of ones love and
duty for even so short a time </s>
<s>  i shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when i wake up in the night </s>
<s>  i wish matthew could have
that comfort but he sets it at defiance </s>
<s>  i am determined not to make a
display of my feelings but its very hard to be told one wants to feast
on ones relationsas if one was a giantand to be told to go </s>
<s>  the
bare idea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  camilla interposing as <abvr> camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth </s>
<s>  sarah
pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last </s>
<s>  but sarah was
too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence </s>
<s>  sarah
pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss
havisham dear </s>
<s>  and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnutshell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest </s>
<s> 

while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly </s>
<s>  at last she
stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it
some seconds

this is my birthday pip </s>
<s> 

i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick </s>
<s> 

i dont suffer it to be spoken of </s>
<s>  i dont suffer those who were here
just now or any one to speak of it </s>
<s>  they come here on the day but they
dare not refer to it </s>
<s> 

of course i made no further effort to refer to it </s>
<s> 

on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of
decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table but not touching it was brought here </s>
<s>  it and i have worn away
together </s>
<s>  the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me </s>
<s> 

she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking
at the table </s>
<s>  she in her once white dress all yellow and withered </s>
<s>  the
once white cloth all yellow and withered </s>
<s>  everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch </s>
<s> 

when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when
they lay me dead in my brides dress on the brides tablewhich shall
be done and which will be the finished curse upon himso much the
better if it is done on this day </s>
<s> 

she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
lying there </s>
<s>  i remained quiet </s>
<s>  estella returned and she too remained
quiet </s>
<s>  it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time </s>
<s>  in
the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might
presently begin to decay </s>
<s> 

at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an
instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards </s>
<s>  why have
you not begun </s>
<s>  with that we returned to her room and sat down as
before </s>
<s>  i was beggared as before </s>
<s>  and again as before miss havisham
watched us all the time directed my attention to estellas beauty and
made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estellas breast and
hair </s>
<s> 

estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she
did not condescend to speak </s>
<s>  when we had played some halfdozen games
a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former doglike manner </s>
<s>  there too i was again left to
wander about as i liked </s>
<s> 

it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last
occasion open or shut </s>
<s>  enough that i saw no gate then and that i
saw one now </s>
<s>  as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let
the visitors outfor she had returned with the keys in her handi
strolled into the garden and strolled all over it </s>
<s>  it was quite a
wilderness and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan </s>
<s> 

when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallendown grapevine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal
corner upon which i had looked out of the window </s>
<s>  never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window
and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair </s>
<s> 

this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me </s>
<s> 
he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i
now saw that he was inky </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he young fellow </s>
<s> 

halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to
be best answered by itself i said halloa </s>
<s>  politely omitting young
fellow </s>
<s> 

who let you in </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

miss estella </s>
<s> 

who gave you leave to prowl about </s>
<s> 

miss estella </s>
<s> 

come and fight said the pale young gentleman </s>
<s> 

what could i do but follow him </s>
<s>  i have often asked myself the question
since </s>
<s>  but what else could i do </s>
<s>  his manner was so final and i was
so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a
spell </s>
<s> 

stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many
paces </s>
<s>  i ought to give you a reason for fighting too </s>
<s>  there it is </s>
<s> 
 in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one
another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair
slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach </s>
<s> 

the bulllike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat </s>
<s>  i therefore hit out
at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha </s>

within my limited experience </s>

his right </s>
<s>  regular rules </s>

his left </s>
<s>  come to the ground and go through the preliminaries </s>
<s>  here
he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i
looked helplessly at him </s>
<s> 

i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous </s>
<s>  but i felt
morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention </s>
<s>  therefore i
followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish </s>
<s>  on his asking me
if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar </s>
<s>  available for both he said
placing these against the wall </s>
<s>  and then fell to pulling off not
only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once
lighthearted businesslike and bloodthirsty </s>
<s> 

although he did not look very healthyhaving pimples on his face and
a breaking out at his mouththese dreadful preparations quite appalled
me </s>
<s>  i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance </s>
<s>  for
the rest he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded
for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him as to development </s>
<s> 

my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were
minutely choosing his bone </s>
<s>  i never have been so surprised in my life
as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his
back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
foreshortened </s>
<s> 

but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again </s>
<s>  the second greatest
surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again
looking up at me out of a black eye </s>
<s> 

his spirit inspired me with great respect </s>
<s>  he seemed to have no
strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down </s>
<s> 
but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out
of the waterbottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he really was going to do for me at last </s>
<s>  he got heavily
bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i
hit him </s>
<s>  but he came up again and again and again until at last he got
a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall </s>
<s>  even after that
crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times not knowing where i was </s>
<s>  but finally went on his knees to his
sponge and threw it up </s>
<s>  at the same time panting out that means you
have won </s>
<s> 

he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the
contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory </s>
<s>  indeed i go
so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast </s>
<s>  however i got dressed darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you </s>
<s> 
 and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same
to you </s>
<s> 

when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys </s>
<s> 
but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her
waiting </s>
<s>  and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something
had happened to delight her </s>
<s>  instead of going straight to the gate too
she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me </s>
<s> 

come here </s>
<s>  you may kiss me if you like </s>
<s> 

i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me </s>
<s>  i think i would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek </s>
<s>  but i felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and
that it was worth nothing </s>
<s> 

what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with
the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black nightsky and joes furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road </s>

chapter xii

my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman </s>
<s>  the
more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me </s>
<s>  i felt that
the pale young gentlemans blood was on my head and that the law would
avenge it </s>
<s>  without having any definite idea of the penalties i had
incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe
punishment </s>
<s>  for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon
me </s>
<s>  the pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers and i tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night </s>
<s>  i had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentlemans teeth and i twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before
the judges </s>
<s> 

when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence my terrors reached their height </s>
<s>  whether myrmidons of justice
specially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the
gate </s>
<s> whether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her house might rise in those graveclothes of hers
draw a pistol and shoot me dead </s>
<s> whether suborned boysa numerous
band of mercenariesmight be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery
and cuff me until i was no more </s>
<s> it was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him
accessory to these retaliations </s>
<s>  they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features </s>
<s> 

however go to miss havishams i must and go i did </s>
<s>  and behold </s>
<s>  nothing
came of the late struggle </s>
<s>  it was not alluded to in any way and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises </s>
<s>  i found the same
gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house </s>
<s>  but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within and all was lifeless </s>
<s>  only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young
gentlemans existence </s>
<s>  there were traces of his gore in that spot and i
covered them with gardenmould from the eye of man </s>
<s> 

on the broad landing between miss havishams own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out i saw a gardenchaira
light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind </s>
<s>  it had been placed
there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular
occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of
walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across
the landing and round the other room </s>
<s>  over and over and over again
we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch </s>
<s>  i insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months </s>
<s> 

as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more
to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was
i going to be </s>
<s>  i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i
believed </s>
<s>  and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end </s>
<s>  but she did not </s>
<s>  on the contrary she seemed to prefer my
being ignorant </s>
<s>  neither did she ever give me any moneyor anything
but my daily dinnernor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my
services </s>
<s> 

estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told
me i might kiss her again </s>
<s>  sometimes she would coldly tolerate me </s>
<s> 
sometimes she would condescend to me </s>
<s>  sometimes she would be quite
familiar with me </s>
<s>  sometimes she would tell me energetically that she
hated me </s>
<s>  miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were
alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip </s>
<s>  and when i said yes
for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily </s>
<s>  also when we
played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of
estellas moods whatever they were </s>
<s>  and sometimes when her moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what
to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness
murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my
pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy </s>
<s> 

there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the
burden was old clem </s>
<s>  this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation
towards smiths </s>
<s>  it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clems
respected name </s>
<s>  thus you were to hammer boys roundold clem </s>
<s>  with a
thump and a soundold clem </s>
<s>  beat it out beat it outold clem </s>
<s>  with a
clink for the stoutold clem </s>
<s>  blow the fire blow the fireold
clem </s>
<s>  roaring dryer soaring higherold clem </s>
<s>  one day soon after the
appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the
impatient movement of her fingers there there there </s>
<s>  sing </s>
<s>  i was
surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor </s>
<s>  it
happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep </s>
<s>  after that it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often
join in </s>
<s>  though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were
three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind </s>
<s> 

what could i become with these surroundings </s>
<s>  how could my character fail
to be influenced by them </s>
<s>  is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms </s>
<s> 

perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
i had confessed </s>
<s>  under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach </s>
<s>  therefore i said nothing of him </s>
<s> 
besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed
which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time
went on </s>
<s>  i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy </s>
<s>  but i told
poor biddy everything </s>
<s>  why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy
had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though
i think i know now </s>
<s> 

meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit </s>
<s>  that ass
pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister </s>
<s>  and i really do believe to
this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart they would have done
it </s>
<s>  the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that
he could not discuss my prospects without having me before himas it
were to operate uponand he would drag me up from my stool usually
by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the
fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum
here is this boy </s>
<s>  here is this boy which you brought up by hand </s>
<s>  hold up
your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do </s>
<s>  now
mum with respections to this boy </s>
<s>  and then he would rumple my hair
the wrong waywhich from my earliest remembrance as already hinted
i have in my soul denied the right of any fellowcreature to doand
would hold me before him by the sleevea spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself </s>
<s> 

then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me
that i used to wantquite painfullyto burst into spiteful tears fly
at pumblechook and pummel him all over </s>
<s>  in these dialogues my sister
spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference </s>
<s>  while pumblechook himself selfconstituted my patron
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job </s>
<s> 

in these discussions joe bore no part </s>
<s>  but he was often talked at
while they were in progress by reason of <abvr> joes perceiving that
he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge </s>
<s>  i was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to joe </s>
<s>  and when joe sat with the poker on
his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his
hands shake him and put it away </s>
<s>  there was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates </s>
<s>  all in a moment with nothing to lead up to
it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come </s>
<s>  theres enough of
you </s>
<s>  you get along to bed </s>
<s>  youve given trouble enough for one night i
hope </s>
<s>  as if i had besought them as a favor to bother my life out </s>
<s> 

we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss
havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my
shoulder </s>
<s>  and said with some displeasure

you are growing tall pip </s>
<s> 

i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control </s>
<s> 

she said no more at the time </s>
<s>  but she presently stopped and looked at me
again </s>
<s>  and presently again </s>
<s>  and after that looked frowning and moody </s>
<s> 
on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and
i had landed her at her dressingtable she stayed me with a movement of
her impatient fingers </s>
<s> 

tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours </s>
<s> 

joe gargery maam </s>
<s> 

meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to </s>
<s> 

yes miss havisham </s>
<s> 

you had better be apprenticed at once </s>
<s>  would gargery come here with
you and bring your indentures do you think </s>
<s> 

i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be
asked </s>
<s> 

then let him come </s>
<s> 

at any particular time miss havisham </s>
<s> 

there there </s>
<s>  i know nothing about times </s>
<s>  let him come soon and come
along with you </s>
<s> 

when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister
went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period </s>
<s>  she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was doormats under
our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously
thought she was fit for </s>
<s>  when she had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing
got out the dustpanwhich was always a very bad signput on her
coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent </s>
<s>  not satisfied
with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush and cleaned
us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the backyard </s>
<s> 
it was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again and
then she asked joe why he hadnt married a negress slave at once </s>
<s> 
joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and
looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a
better speculation </s>
<s> 




chapter xiii

it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see
joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss
havishams </s>
<s>  however as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the
occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his
workingdress </s>
<s>  the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled
up his shirtcollar so very high behind that it made the hair on the
crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers </s>
<s> 

at breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with
us and being left at uncle pumblechooks and called for when we had
done with our fine ladiesa way of putting the case from which joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst </s>
<s>  the forge was shut up for the day
and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable
hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he had taken </s>
<s> 

we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited
straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it
was a fine bright day </s>
<s>  i am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously </s>
<s>  but i rather think they were
displayed as articles of propertymuch as cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
procession </s>
<s> 

when we came to pumblechooks my sister bounced in and left us </s>
<s>  as it
was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havishams house </s>
<s> 
estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took
his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands </s>
<s>  as if
he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce </s>
<s> 

estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew
so well </s>
<s>  i followed next to her and joe came last </s>
<s>  when i looked back
at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the
greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his toes </s>
<s> 

estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coatcuff
and conducted him into miss havishams presence </s>
<s>  she was seated at her
dressingtable and looked round at us immediately </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said she to joe </s>
<s>  you are the husband of the sister of this boy </s>
<s> 

i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird </s>
<s>  standing as he did speechless with his
tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm </s>
<s> 

you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this
boy </s>
<s> 

it was very aggravating </s>
<s>  but throughout the interview joe persisted in
addressing me instead of miss havisham </s>
<s> 

which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great
politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time
what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  and you have reared the boy with the
intention of taking him for your apprentice </s>
<s>  is that so <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it
were looked forard to betwixt us as being calclated to lead to
larks </s>
<s>  not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the
businesssuch as its being open to black and sut or suchlikenot
but what they would have been attended to dont you see </s>
<s> 

has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection </s>
<s>  does he
like the trade </s>
<s> 

which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening
his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that
it were the wish of your own hart </s>
<s>  i saw the idea suddenly break upon
him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on
to say and there werent no objection on your part and pip it were
the great wish of your hart </s>
<s> 

it was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he
ought to speak to miss havisham </s>
<s>  the more i made faces and gestures
to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he
persisted in being to me </s>
<s> 

have you brought his indentures with you </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham </s>
<s> 

well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little
unreasonable you yourself see me put �em in my �at and therefore you
know as they are here </s>
<s>  with which he took them out and gave them not
to miss havisham but to me </s>
<s>  i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good
fellowi know i was ashamed of himwhen i saw that estella stood
at the back of miss havishams chair and that her eyes laughed
mischievously </s>

miss havisham </s>
<s> 

you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium
with the boy </s>
<s> 

joe </s>
<s>  i remonstrated for he made no reply at all </s>
<s>  why dont you
answer

pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me and which you know the answer to be full well no </s>
<s>  you know it to
be no pip and wherefore should i say it </s>
<s> 

miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there </s>
<s>  and took
up a little bag from the table beside her </s>
<s> 

pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is </s>
<s>  there are
fiveandtwenty guineas in this bag </s>
<s>  give it to your master pip </s>
<s> 

as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass
persisted in addressing me </s>
<s> 

this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such
received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near
nor nowheres </s>
<s>  and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation
first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to miss havishamand now old chap may we
do our duty </s>
<s>  may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another
and by them which your liberal presenthaveconweyedto befor the
satisfaction of mindofthem as never here joe showed that he felt
he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued
himself with the words and from myself far be it </s>
<s>  these words had
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice </s>
<s> 

goodbye pip </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  let them out estella </s>
<s> 

am i to come again miss havisham </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  gargery is your master now </s>
<s>  gargery </s>
<s>  one word </s>
<s> 

thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe
in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and
that is his reward </s>
<s>  of course as an honest man you will expect no
other and no more </s>
<s> 

how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine </s>
<s>  but
i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs
instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went
after him and laid hold of him </s>
<s>  in another minute we were outside the
gate and it was locked and estella was gone </s>
<s>  when we stood in the
daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me
astonishing </s>
<s>  and there he remained so long saying astonishing at
intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming
back </s>
<s>  at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this
is astonishing </s>
<s>  and so by degrees became conversational and able to
walk away </s>
<s> 

i have reason to think that joes intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechooks
he invented a subtle and deep design </s>
<s>  my reason is to be found in
what took place in <abvr> pumblechooks parlor </s>
<s>  where on our presenting
ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman </s>
<s> 

well </s>

society as this i am sure i do </s>

armchair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all

its more than that then said joe </s>

that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a
patronizing laugh its more than that mum </s>

then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my
sister </s>

if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently
awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody

behind </s>

<s> 
bound out of hand </s>
<s> 

goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the
money were deeply beholden to you </s>
<s> 

never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler </s>
<s>  a
pleasures a pleasure all the world over </s>
<s>  but this boy you know </s>
<s>  we
must have him bound </s>
<s>  i said id see to itto tell you the truth </s>
<s> 

the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial
presence </s>
<s>  i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook
exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick </s>
<s>  indeed
it was the general impression in court that i had been taken redhanded </s>
<s> 
for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some
people say whats he done </s>
<s>  and others hes a young �un too but
looks bad dont he </s>
<s>  one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters and entitled to be read in my
cell </s>
<s> 

the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a
churchand with people hanging over the pews looking onand with
mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with
folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading
the newspapersand with some shining black portraits on the walls
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
stickingplaster </s>
<s>  here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested and i was bound </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little
preliminaries disposed of </s>
<s> 

when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me we went back to pumblechooks </s>
<s>  and there my sister
became so excited by the twentyfive guineas that nothing would serve
her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and
that pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart and bring the hubbles
and <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

it was agreed to be done </s>
<s>  and a most melancholy day i passed </s>
<s>  for
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole
company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment </s>
<s>  and to make it
worse they all asked me from time to timein short whenever they
had nothing else to dowhy i didnt enjoy myself </s>
<s>  and what could i
possibly do then but say i was enjoying myselfwhen i wasnt </s>
<s> 

however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the
most of it </s>
<s>  that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table </s>
<s> 
and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i
played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair
beside him to illustrate his remarks </s>
<s> 

my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldnt
let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself </s>
<s>  that rather late in the evening <abvr> wopsle
gave us collinss ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder
down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials
underneath sent up their compliments and it wasnt the tumblers arms </s>
<s> 
 that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o
lady fair </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about
everybodys private affairs that he was the man with his white locks
flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going </s>
<s> 

finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly
wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like
joes trade </s>
<s>  i had liked it once but once was not now </s>

chapter xiv

it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home </s>
<s>  there may be black
ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved </s>
<s>  but that it is a miserable thing i can testify </s>
<s> 

home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sisters
temper </s>
<s>  but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it </s>
<s>  i had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon </s>
<s>  i had believed
in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls </s>
<s>  i had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment </s>
<s> 
i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence </s>
<s>  within a single year all this was changed </s>
<s>  now it was all
coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella
see it on any account </s>
<s> 

how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault
how much miss havishams how much my sisters is now of no moment to
me or to any one </s>
<s>  the change was made in me </s>
<s>  the thing was done </s>
<s>  well or
ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done </s>
<s> 

once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my
shirtsleeves and go into the forge joes �prentice i should be
distinguished and happy </s>
<s>  now the reality was in my hold i only felt
that i was dusty with the dust of smallcoal and that i had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather </s>
<s>  there have
been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more </s>
<s> 
never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to joe </s>
<s> 

i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about
the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea </s>
<s>  i was quite
as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that
aftertime </s>
<s>  but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe
while my indentures lasted </s>
<s>  it is about the only thing i am glad to know
of myself in that connection </s>
<s> 

for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i
proceed to add was joes </s>
<s>  it was not because i was faithful but because
joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor </s>
<s>  it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry
that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain </s>
<s>  it is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing
man flies out into the world </s>
<s>  but it is very possible to know how it has
touched ones self in going by and i know right well that any good that
intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented joe
and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me </s>
<s> 

what i wanted who can say </s>
<s>  how can i say when i never knew </s>
<s>  what
i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and
commonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one
of the wooden windows of the forge </s>
<s>  i was haunted by the fear that she
would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing
the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me </s>
<s> 
often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were
singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss
havishams would seem to show me estellas face in the fire with her
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning meoften at
such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just
drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last </s>
<s> 

after that when we went into supper the place and the meal would have
a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than
ever in my own ungracious breast </s>

chapter xv

education under that preposterous female terminated </s>

of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny </s>

the opening lines </s>

<s> 
     too rul loo rul
     too rul loo rul

still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity </s>
<s>  nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i
thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry </s>
<s>  in my hunger for information i made proposals to <abvr> wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied </s>
<s> 
as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic
layfigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon
declined that course of instruction </s>
<s>  though not until <abvr> wopsle in his
poetic fury had severely mauled me </s>
<s> 

whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe </s>
<s>  this statement sounds so
well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained </s>
<s>  i wanted
to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my
society and less open to estellas reproach </s>
<s> 

the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken
slate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational implements </s>
<s> 
to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco </s>
<s>  i never knew joe to
remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my
tuition any piece of information whatever </s>
<s>  yet he would smoke his pipe
at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere elseeven
with a learned airas if he considered himself to be advancing
immensely </s>
<s>  dear fellow i hope he did </s>
<s> 

it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water </s>
<s>  whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and
estella </s>
<s>  and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud
or sail or green hillside or waterline it was just the same </s>
<s> miss
havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque </s>
<s> 

one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on
being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of
miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the
water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head </s>
<s> 

joe said i </s>
<s>  dont you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit </s>
<s> 

well pip returned joe slowly considering </s>
<s>  what for </s>
<s> 

what for joe </s>
<s>  what is any visit made for </s>
<s> 

there is some wisits praps said joe as for ever remains open to
the question pip </s>
<s>  but in regard to wisiting miss havisham </s>
<s>  she might
think you wanted somethingexpected something of her </s>
<s> 

dont you think i might say that i did not joe </s>
<s> 

you might old chap said joe </s>
<s>  and she might credit it </s>
<s>  similarly she
mightnt </s>
<s> 

joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard
at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition </s>
<s> 

you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss
havisham done the handsome thing by you </s>
<s>  when miss havisham done the
handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were
all </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>

<s> 

all joe repeated very emphatically </s>

yes joe </s>

which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning weremake a
end on it </s>
<s> as you was </s>
<s> me to the north and you to the south </s>
<s> keep in
sunders </s>
<s> 

i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he had thought of it </s>

probable </s>
<s> 

but joe </s>
<s> 

yes old chap </s>
<s> 

here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day
of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after
her or shown that i remember her </s>

thats true pip </s>
<s>  and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes

hoofs

i dont mean that sort of remembrance joe </s>
<s>  i dont mean a present </s>

but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it </s>
<s> 
or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain
for the front dooror say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for
general useor some light fancy article such as a toastingfork
when she took her muffinsor a gridiron when she took a sprat or such
like

i dont mean any present at all joe i interposed </s>
<s> 

well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly
pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldnt </s>
<s>  no i would not </s>
<s>  for
whats a doorchain when shes got one always up </s>
<s>  and sharkheaders is
open to misrepresentations </s>
<s>  and if it was a toastingfork youd go into
brass and do yourself no credit </s>
<s>  and the oncommonest workman cant show
himself oncommon in a gridironfor a gridiron is a gridiron said
joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but
a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave
and you cant help yourself

my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat dont
go on in that way </s>
<s>  i never thought of making miss havisham any present </s>
<s> 

no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all
along </s>
<s>  and what i say to you is you are right pip </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s>  but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack
just now if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow i think i would
go uptown and make a call on miss esthavisham </s>
<s> 

which her name said joe gravely aint estavisham pip unless she
have been rechrisened </s>
<s> 

i know joe i know </s>
<s>  it was a slip of mine </s>
<s>  what do you think of it
joe </s>
<s> 

in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of
it </s>
<s>  but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received
with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received then this experimental trip should have no successor </s>
<s>  by
these conditions i promised to abide </s>
<s> 

now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick </s>
<s> 
he pretended that his christian name was dolgea clear
impossibilitybut he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i
believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding </s>
<s>  he was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of
great strength never in a hurry and always slouching </s>
<s>  he never even
seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere
accident </s>
<s>  and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or
went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew
as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever
coming back </s>
<s>  he lodged at a sluicekeepers out on the marshes and on
workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back </s>
<s>  on sundays he mostly lay all day on the
sluicegates or stood against ricks and barns </s>
<s>  he always slouched
locomotively with his eyes on the ground </s>
<s>  and when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a halfresentful
halfpuzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking </s>
<s> 

this morose journeyman had no liking for me </s>
<s>  when i was very small and
timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner
of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well </s>
<s>  also that it was
necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and
that i might consider myself fuel </s>
<s>  when i became joes �prentice orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him </s>
<s> 
howbeit he liked me still less </s>
<s>  not that he ever said anything or did
anything openly importing hostility </s>
<s>  i only noticed that he always beat
his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came
in out of time </s>
<s> 

dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of
my halfholiday </s>
<s>  he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows </s>
<s>  but by
and by he said leaning on his hammer

now master </s>
<s>  sure youre not a going to favor only one of us </s>
<s>  if young
pip has a halfholiday do as much for old orlick </s>
<s>  i suppose he was
about fiveandtwenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person </s>
<s> 

why whatll you do with a halfholiday if you get it </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s> 

whatll i do with it </s>
<s>  whatll he do with it </s>
<s>  ill do as much with it as
him said orlick </s>
<s> 

as to pip hes going up town said joe </s>
<s> 

well then as to old orlick hes a going up town retorted that
worthy </s>
<s>  two can go up town </s>
<s>  taint only one wot can go up town </s>
<s> 

dont lose your temper said joe </s>

shall if i like growled orlick </s>
<s>  some and their uptowning </s>
<s>  now
master </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  no favoring in this shop </s>
<s>  be a man </s>
<s> 

the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a redhot
bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body
whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it outas
if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting bloodand
finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he
again leaned on his hammer

now master </s>
<s> 

are you all right now </s>
<s>  demanded joe </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i am all right said gruff old orlick </s>
<s> 

then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said
joe let it be a halfholiday for all </s>
<s> 

my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearingshe was
a most unscrupulous spy and listenerand she instantly looked in at
one of the windows </s>
<s> 

like you you fool </s>
<s>  said she to joe giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that </s>
<s>  you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in
that way </s>

youd be everybodys master if you durst retorted orlick with an
illfavored grin </s>
<s> 

let her alone said joe </s>
<s> 

id be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage </s>
<s>  and i couldnt be a
match for the noodles without being a match for your master whos the
dunderheaded king of the noodles </s>
<s>  and i couldnt be a match for the
rogues without being a match for you who are the blackestlooking and
the worst rogue between this and france </s>

youre a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman </s>
<s>  if that
makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a goodun </s>

<s>  what did he call me
with my husband standing by </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  each of these exclamations was
a shriek </s>
<s>  and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all
the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for
her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it and became blindly furious by regular stages </s>
<s>  what was the
name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  hold me </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s> 

ahhh </s>
<s>  growled the journeyman between his teeth id hold you if
you was my wife </s>
<s>  id hold you under the pump and choke it out of you </s>
<s> 

i tell you let her alone said joe </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to hear him </s>
<s>  cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a
scream togetherwhich was her next stage </s>
<s>  to hear the names hes
giving me </s>
<s>  that orlick </s>
<s>  in my own house </s>
<s>  me a married woman </s>
<s>  with my
husband standing by </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  here my sister after a fit of clappings
and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and
threw her cap off and pulled her hair downwhich were the last stages
on her road to frenzy </s>
<s>  being by this time a perfect fury and a complete
success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked </s>
<s> 

what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical
interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant
by interfering betwixt himself and <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  and further whether he was
man enough to come on </s>
<s>  old orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway </s>
<s>  so
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went
at one another like two giants </s>
<s>  but if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man </s>
<s>  orlick as if he
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very
soon among the coaldust and in no hurry to come out of it </s>
<s>  then joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible
at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was
carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joes hair </s>
<s> 
then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars </s>
<s>  and
then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such
a lullnamely that it was sunday and somebody was deadi went upstairs
to dress myself </s>
<s> 

when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlicks nostrils
which was neither expressive nor ornamental </s>
<s>  a pot of beer had appeared
from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner </s>
<s>  the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation
that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage
pip </s>
<s> such is life </s>
<s> 

with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to

chair towards me you are looking round for estella </s>

i had been looking roundin fact for estellaand i stammered that i

abroad said miss havisham </s>
<s>  educating for a lady </s>
<s>  far out of reach </s>
<s> 
prettier than ever </s>
<s>  admired by all who see her </s>
<s>  do you feel that you
have lost her </s>
<s> 

there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words

to say </s>
<s>  she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me </s>
<s>  when
the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnutshell countenance i
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
everything </s>

as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman
who should come out of the bookshop but <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle had in
his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that
moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on
the head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea </s>

did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence
had put a �prentice in his way to be read at </s>

knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better

pumblechooks just as the street and the shops were lighting up </s>

as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i
dont know how long it may usually take </s>

took until halfpast nine o clock that night and that when <abvr> wopsle
got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became

thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short

mere question of length and wearisomeness </s>
<s>  what stung me was the
identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self </s>

barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic
pumblechooks indignant stare so taxed me with it </s>

pains to present me in the worst light </s>
<s>  at once ferocious and maudlin i
was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever </s>
<s> 
millwood put me down in argument on every occasion </s>
<s>  it became sheer
monomania in my masters daughter to care a button for me </s>

in effect we had not walked many yards further when the

rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing
and threatening the fugitives </s>

a good night for cutting off in said orlick </s>

chapter xvi

with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe
that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at
all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under
obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else </s>
<s>  but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i
took another view of the case which was more reasonable </s>
<s> 

joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a
quarter after eight oclock to a quarter before ten </s>
<s>  while he was there
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged
good night with a farmlaborer going home </s>
<s>  the man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense
confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine </s>
<s> 
when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down
on the floor and promptly called in assistance </s>
<s>  the fire had not then
burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long </s>
<s>  the
candle however had been blown out </s>
<s> 

nothing had been taken away from any part of the house </s>
<s>  neither beyond
the blowing out of the candlewhich stood on a table between the door
and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was
struckwas there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such
as she herself had made in falling and bleeding </s>
<s>  but there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot </s>
<s>  she had been struck with
something blunt and heavy on the head and spine </s>
<s>  after the blows were
dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
violence as she lay on her face </s>
<s>  and on the ground beside her when joe
picked her up was a convicts legiron which had been filed asunder </s>
<s> 

now joe examining this iron with a smiths eye declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago </s>
<s>  the hue and cry going off to the
hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joes opinion
was corroborated </s>
<s>  they did not undertake to say when it had left the
prisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged </s>
<s>  but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night </s>
<s>  further one of
those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron </s>
<s> 

knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here </s>
<s>  i believed
the iron to be my convicts ironthe iron i had seen and heard him
filing at on the marshesbut my mind did not accuse him of having put
it to its latest use </s>
<s>  for i believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account </s>
<s> 
either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file </s>
<s> 

now as to orlick </s>
<s>  he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the
evening he had been in divers companies in several publichouses and
he had come back with myself and <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s>  there was nothing against
him save the quarrel </s>
<s>  and my sister had quarrelled with him and with
everybody else about her ten thousand times </s>
<s>  as to the strange man </s>
<s>  if
he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute
about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them </s>
<s> 
besides there had been no altercation </s>
<s>  the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look
round </s>
<s> 

it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however
undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise </s>
<s>  i suffered unspeakable
trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story </s>
<s>  for
months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the
negative and reopened and reargued it next morning </s>
<s>  the contention
came after all to this </s>
<s> the secret was such an old one now had so
grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it
away </s>
<s>  in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he
believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe
it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets as a
monstrous invention </s>
<s>  however i temporized with myself of coursefor
was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always
done </s>
<s> and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant </s>
<s> 

the constables and the bow street men from londonfor this happened in
the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for
a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases </s>
<s>  they took up several obviously
wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances </s>
<s>  also they stood
about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration </s>
<s>  and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as
taking the culprit </s>
<s>  but not quite for they never did it </s>
<s> 

long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very
ill in bed </s>
<s>  her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities </s>
<s>  her hearing was greatly impaired </s>
<s>  her memory also </s>
<s>  and her
speech was unintelligible </s>
<s>  when at last she came round so far as to
be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in
speech </s>
<s>  as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent
speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary
complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve </s>
<s> 
the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of
tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own
mistakes </s>
<s> 

however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient </s>
<s>  a
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three
months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind </s>
<s>  we were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsles greataunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a
part of our establishment </s>
<s> 

it may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the
kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household </s>
<s> 
above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had
been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me
every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine
figure of a woman as she once were pip </s>
<s>  biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy </s>
<s>  joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life
and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did
him good </s>
<s>  it was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered </s>
<s> 

biddys first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me </s>
<s>  i had tried hard at it but had made
nothing of it </s>
<s>  thus it was </s>
<s> 

again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a
character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted </s>
<s>  i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t
from tar to toast and tub </s>
<s>  at length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my
sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent </s>
<s>  thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after
another but without avail </s>
<s>  then i bethought me of a crutch the shape
being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence </s>
<s>  but she shook her head to
that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her
weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck </s>
<s> 

when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate </s>
<s>  biddy looked thoughtfully
at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked
thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his
initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me </s>
<s> 

why of course </s>
<s>  cried biddy with an exultant face </s>
<s>  dont you see </s>
<s> 
its him </s>
<s> 

orlick without a doubt </s>
<s>  she had lost his name and could only signify
him by his hammer </s>
<s>  we told him why we wanted him to come into the
kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his
arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching
out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him </s>
<s> 

i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i
was disappointed by the different result </s>
<s>  she manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his
being at length produced and motioned that she would have him
given something to drink </s>
<s>  she watched his countenance as if she were
particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception
she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master </s>
<s>  after that day a day rarely
passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks
slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more
than i did what to make of it </s>

chapter xvii

i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to miss havisham </s>
<s>  i found miss sarah pocket still on duty
at the gate </s>
<s>  i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke
of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words </s>
<s>  the
interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was
going and told me to come again on my next birthday </s>
<s>  i may mention at
once that this became an annual custom </s>
<s>  i tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her
to ask me very angrily if i expected more </s>
<s>  then and after that i took
it </s>
<s> 

so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened
room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass that
i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that
mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew
older it stood still </s>
<s>  daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact </s>
<s>  it
bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home </s>
<s> 

imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however </s>
<s>  her
shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were
always clean </s>
<s>  she was not beautifulshe was common and could not be
like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered </s>
<s> 
she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one
evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes </s>
<s>  eyes that
were very pretty and very good </s>
<s> 

it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring
atwriting some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagemand seeing biddy observant of what i was
about </s>
<s>  i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without
laying it down </s>
<s> 

biddy said i how do you manage it </s>
<s>  either i am very stupid or you
are very clever </s>
<s> 

what is it that i manage </s>
<s>  i dont know returned biddy smiling </s>
<s> 

she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too </s>
<s>  but i did not
mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising </s>
<s> 

how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn
and always to keep up with me </s>
<s>  i was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the
greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment </s>
<s>  though i have no
doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price </s>
<s> 

i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see
me turning to at it </s>
<s>  but you never turn to at it biddy </s>
<s> 

i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly </s>
<s>  and went
on with her sewing </s>
<s> 

pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at
biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather
an extraordinary girl </s>
<s>  for i called to mind now that she was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different
sorts of work and our various tools </s>
<s>  in short whatever i knew biddy
knew </s>
<s>  theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or
better </s>
<s> 

you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every
chance </s>
<s>  you never had a chance before you came here and see how
improved you are </s>
<s> 

biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing </s>
<s>  i was
your first teacher though </s>
<s>  wasnt i </s>
<s>  said she as she sewed </s>
<s> 

biddy </s>
<s>  i exclaimed in amazement </s>
<s>  why you are crying </s>
<s> 

no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing </s>
<s>  what put that in
your head </s>
<s> 

what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work </s>
<s>  i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been
until <abvr> wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people </s>
<s>  i recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered </s>
<s>  i reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first
uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of
course </s>
<s>  biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i
looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps
i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy </s>
<s>  i might have been too
reserved and should have patronized her more though i did not use that
precise word in my meditations with my confidence </s>
<s> 

yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my
first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this in this kitchen </s>
<s> 

ah poor thing </s>
<s>  replied biddy </s>
<s>  it was like her selfforgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her
making her more comfortable </s>
<s>  thats sadly true </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do </s>
<s> 
and i must consult you a little more as i used to do </s>
<s>  let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat </s>
<s> 

my sister was never left alone now </s>
<s>  but joe more than readily undertook
the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out
together </s>
<s>  it was summertime and lovely weather </s>
<s>  when we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to
combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way </s>
<s> 
when we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank with the water
rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of biddy into my inner confidence </s>
<s> 

biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a
gentleman </s>
<s> 

o i wouldnt if i was you </s>
<s>  she returned </s>
<s>  i dont think it would
answer </s>
<s> 

biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman </s>
<s> 

you know best pip </s>
<s>  but dont you think you are happier as you are </s>
<s> 

biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am </s>
<s>  i
am disgusted with my calling and with my life </s>
<s>  i have never taken to
either since i was bound </s>
<s>  dont be absurd </s>
<s> 

was i absurd </s>
<s>  said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows </s>
<s>  i am sorry
for that </s>
<s>  i didnt mean to be </s>
<s>  i only want you to do well and to be
comfortable </s>
<s> 

well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be
comfortableor anything but miserablethere biddy </s>
<s> unless i can lead
a very different sort of life from the life i lead now </s>
<s> 

thats a pity </s>
<s>  said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air </s>
<s> 

now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her
sentiment and my own </s>
<s>  i told her she was right and i knew it was much
to be regretted but still it was not to be helped </s>
<s> 

if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short
grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wallif i could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was
little i know it would have been much better for me </s>
<s>  you and i and joe
would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone
partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to
keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
sunday quite different people </s>
<s>  i should have been good enough for you </s>
<s> 
shouldnt i biddy </s>
<s> 

biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for
answer yes </s>
<s>  i am not overparticular </s>
<s>  it scarcely sounded flattering
but i knew she meant well </s>
<s> 

instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two see how i am going on </s>
<s>  dissatisfied and uncomfortable andwhat
would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me
so </s>
<s> 

biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more
attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships </s>
<s> 

it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she
remarked directing her eyes to the ships again </s>
<s>  who said it </s>
<s> 

i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where
i was going to </s>
<s>  it was not to be shuffled off now however and i
answered the beautiful young lady at miss havishams and shes more
beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want
to be a gentleman on her account </s>
<s>  having made this lunatic confession
i began to throw my tornup grass into the river as if i had some
thoughts of following it </s>
<s> 

do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over </s>
<s>  biddy
quietly asked me after a pause </s>
<s> 

i dont know i moodily answered </s>
<s> 

because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should thinkbut
you know bestthat might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her words </s>
<s>  and if it is to gain her over i should
thinkbut you know bestshe was not worth gaining over </s>
<s> 

exactly what i myself had thought many times </s>
<s>  exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment </s>
<s>  but how could i a poor dazed
village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day </s>
<s> 

it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her
dreadfully </s>
<s> 

in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well </s>
<s>  all the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced
that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i
had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot </s>
<s> 

biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me </s>
<s> 
she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work
upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair </s>
<s> 
then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face
upon my sleeve i cried a littleexactly as i had done in the brewery
yardand felt vaguely convinced that i was very much illused by
somebody or by everybody </s>
<s>  i cant say which </s>
<s> 

i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt
you could give me your confidence pip </s>
<s>  and i am glad of another thing
and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it </s>
<s>  if your first teacher dear </s>
<s>  such a poor
one and so much in need of being taught herself </s>
<s>  had been your teacher
at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set </s>
<s>  but
it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and its
of no use now </s>
<s>  so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank
and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a
little farther or go home </s>
<s> 

biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving
her a kiss i shall always tell you everything </s>
<s> 

till youre a gentleman said biddy </s>
<s> 

you know i never shall be so thats always </s>
<s>  not that i have any
occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i knowas i
told you at home the other night </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships </s>
<s> 
and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a
little farther or go home </s>
<s> 

i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very
beautiful </s>
<s>  i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing
beggar my neighbor by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks
and being despised by estella </s>
<s>  i thought it would be very good for me if
i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do
and stick to it and make the best of it </s>
<s>  i asked myself the question
whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that
moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable </s>
<s>  i was obliged to
admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip
what a fool you are </s>
<s> 

we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed
right </s>
<s>  biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy today and
somebody else tomorrow </s>
<s>  she would have derived only pain and no
pleasure from giving me pain </s>
<s>  she would far rather have wounded her own
breast than mine </s>
<s>  how could it be then that i did not like her much
the better of the two </s>
<s> 

biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me
right </s>
<s> 

i wish i could </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s> 

if i could only get myself to fall in love with youyou dont mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance </s>
<s> 

oh dear not at all </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  dont mind me </s>
<s> 

if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me </s>
<s> 

but you never will you see said biddy </s>
<s> 

it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before </s>
<s>  i therefore observed
i was not quite sure of that </s>
<s>  but biddy said she was and she said it
decisively </s>
<s>  in my heart i believed her to be right </s>
<s>  and yet i took it
rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point </s>
<s> 

when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and
get over a stile near a sluicegate </s>
<s>  there started up from the gate or
from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way
old orlick </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  he growled where are you two going </s>
<s> 

where should we be going but home </s>
<s> 

well then said he im jiggered if i dont see you home </s>
<s> 

this penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his </s>
<s>  he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but
used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging </s>
<s>  when i was younger i
had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook </s>
<s> 

biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper
dont let him come </s>
<s>  i dont like him </s>
<s>  as i did not like him either
i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnt want
seeing home </s>
<s>  he received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little
distance </s>
<s> 

curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account i asked her why she did not like him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us
because ii am afraid he likes me </s>
<s> 

did he ever tell you he liked you </s>
<s>  i asked indignantly </s>
<s> 

no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me
so </s>
<s>  but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye </s>
<s> 

however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation </s>
<s>  i was very hot indeed upon
old orlicks daring to admire her </s>
<s>  as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself </s>
<s> 

but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly </s>
<s> 

no biddy it makes no difference to me </s>
<s>  only i dont like it </s>
<s>  i dont
approve of it </s>
<s> 

nor i neither said biddy </s>
<s>  though that makes no difference to you </s>
<s> 

exactly said i </s>
<s>  but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you
biddy if he danced at you with your own consent </s>
<s> 

i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances
were favorable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that
demonstration </s>
<s>  he had struck root in joes establishment by reason
of my sisters sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him
dismissed </s>
<s>  he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i
had reason to know thereafter </s>
<s> 

and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated
its confusion fifty thousandfold by having states and seasons when i
was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the
plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect
and happiness </s>
<s>  at those times i would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company
with biddywhen all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter
my wits again </s>
<s>  scattered wits take a long time picking up </s>
<s>  and often
before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out </s>
<s> 

if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities i dare say </s>
<s>  it never did run out however but was brought
to a premature end as i proceed to relate </s>

chapter xviii

it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a
saturday night </s>
<s>  there was a group assembled round the fire at the three
jolly bargemen attentive to <abvr> wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud </s>
<s> 
of that group i was one </s>
<s> 

a highly popular murder had been committed and <abvr> wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows </s>
<s>  he gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description and identified himself with every witness at the
inquest </s>
<s>  he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he
barbarously bellowed ill serve you out as the murderer </s>
<s>  he gave the
medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner </s>
<s>  and
he piped and shook as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness </s>
<s>  the coroner in <abvr> wopsles hands became
timon of athens </s>
<s>  the beadle coriolanus </s>
<s>  he enjoyed himself thoroughly
and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable </s>
<s>  in this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder </s>
<s> 

then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me looking on </s>
<s>  there was an expression
of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
watched the group of faces </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the stranger to <abvr> wopsle when the reading was done you
have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt </s>
<s> 

everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer </s>
<s>  he looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically </s>
<s> 

guilty of course </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  out with it </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

sir returned <abvr> wopsle without having the honor of your
acquaintance i do say guilty </s>
<s>  upon this we all took courage to unite
in a confirmatory murmur </s>
<s> 

i know you do said the stranger </s>
<s>  i knew you would </s>
<s>  i told you so </s>
<s> 
but now ill ask you a question </s>
<s>  do you know or do you not know
that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is
provedprovedto be guilty </s>
<s> 

sir <abvr> wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself i

come </s>
<s>  said the stranger biting his forefinger at him </s>
<s>  dont evade
the question </s>
<s>  either you know it or you dont know it </s>
<s>  which is it to
be </s>
<s> 

he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a
bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at <abvr>
wopsleas it were to mark him outbefore biting it again </s>
<s> 

now </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  do you know it or dont you know it </s>
<s> 

certainly i know it replied <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

certainly you know it </s>
<s>  then why didnt you say so at first </s>
<s>  now ill
ask you another questiontaking possession of <abvr> wopsle as if he
had a right to himdo you know that none of these witnesses have yet
been crossexamined </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped
him </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  you wont answer the question yes or no </s>
<s>  now ill try you
again </s>
<s>  throwing his finger at him again </s>
<s>  attend to me </s>
<s>  are you
aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been
crossexamined </s>
<s>  come i only want one word from you </s>
<s>  yes or no </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
of him </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said the stranger ill help you </s>
<s>  you dont deserve help but
ill help you </s>
<s>  look at that paper you hold in your hand </s>
<s>  what is it </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> wopsle eyeing it much at a loss </s>
<s> 

is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner the printed paper you have just been reading from </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers
instructed him altogether to reserve his defence </s>
<s> 

i read that just now <abvr> wopsle pleaded </s>
<s> 

never mind what you read just now sir </s>
<s>  i dont ask you what you read
just now </s>
<s>  you may read the lords prayer backwards if you likeand
perhaps have done it before today </s>
<s>  turn to the paper </s>
<s>  no no no my
friend </s>
<s>  not to the top of the column </s>
<s>  you know better than that </s>
<s>  to
the bottom to the bottom </s>
<s>  we all began to think <abvr> wopsle full of
subterfuge </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  have you found it </s>
<s> 

here it is said <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  do
you make that of it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle answered those are not the exact words </s>
<s> 

not the exact words </s>
<s>  repeated the gentleman bitterly </s>
<s>  is that the
exact substance </s>
<s> 

yes said <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company
with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle </s>
<s>  and now i ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage
before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having
pronounced a fellowcreature guilty unheard </s>
<s> 

we all began to suspect that <abvr> wopsle was not the man we had thought
him and that he was beginning to be found out </s>
<s> 

and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his
finger at <abvr> wopsle heavilythat same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself
might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his
pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the
issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the
bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help
him god </s>
<s> 

we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too
far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet
time </s>
<s> 

the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose
it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two
settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand
in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right </s>
<s> 

from information i have received said he looking round at us as we
all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith
among you by name josephor joegargery </s>
<s>  which is the man </s>
<s> 

here is the man said joe </s>
<s> 

the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went </s>
<s> 

you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip </s>
<s> 
is he here </s>
<s> 

i am here </s>
<s>  i cried </s>
<s> 

the stranger did not recognize me but i recognized him as the gentleman
i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss
havisham </s>
<s>  i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle
and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder
i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his
deepset eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watchchain his
strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented
soap on his great hand </s>
<s> 

i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had
surveyed me at his leisure </s>
<s>  it will take a little time </s>
<s>  perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence </s>
<s>  i prefer not to anticipate my
communication here </s>
<s>  you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards </s>
<s>  i have nothing to do with that </s>
<s> 

amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen
and in a wondering silence walked home </s>
<s>  while going along the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of
his finger </s>
<s>  as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door </s>
<s> 
our conference was held in the state parlor which was feebly lighted by
one candle </s>
<s> 

it began with the strange gentlemans sitting down at the table drawing
the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocketbook </s>
<s> 
he then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little aside after
peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was
which </s>
<s> 

my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london </s>
<s>  i am
pretty well known </s>
<s>  i have unusual business to transact with you and i
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating </s>
<s>  if my advice
had been asked i should not have been here </s>
<s>  it was not asked and you
see me here </s>
<s>  what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i
do </s>
<s>  no less no more </s>
<s> 

finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got
up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it </s>
<s>  thus
having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground </s>
<s> 

now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice </s>
<s>  you would not object to cancel his
indentures at his request and for his good </s>
<s>  you would want nothing for
so doing </s>
<s> 

lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pips way
 said joe staring </s>
<s> 

lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned <abvr>
jaggers </s>
<s>  the question is would you want anything </s>
<s>  do you want
anything </s>
<s> 

the answer is returned joe sternly no </s>
<s> 

i thought <abvr> jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for
his disinterestedness </s>
<s>  but i was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise to be sure of it </s>
<s> 

very well said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  recollect the admission you have made
and dont try to go from it presently </s>
<s> 

whos a going to try </s>
<s>  retorted joe </s>
<s> 

i dont say anybody is </s>
<s>  do you keep a dog </s>
<s> 

yes i do keep a dog </s>
<s> 

bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better </s>
<s> 
bear that in mind will you </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> jaggers shutting his eyes
and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something </s>
<s> 
now i return to this young fellow </s>
<s>  and the communication i have got to
make is that he has great expectations </s>
<s> 

joe and i gasped and looked at one another </s>
<s> 

i am instructed to communicate to him said <abvr> jaggers throwing
his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property </s>
<s> 
further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life
and from this place and be brought up as a gentlemanin a word as a
young fellow of great expectations </s>
<s> 

my dream was out </s>
<s>  my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality </s>
<s>  miss
havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have
to say to you </s>
<s>  you are to understand first that it is the request
of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear
the name of pip </s>
<s>  you will have no objection i dare say to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition </s>
<s>  but if you have
any objection this is the time to mention it </s>
<s> 

my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears
that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  now you are to understand secondly <abvr> pip that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret until the person chooses to reveal it </s>
<s>  i am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself </s>
<s>  when or where that intention may be carried
out i cannot say </s>
<s>  no one can say </s>
<s>  it may be years hence </s>
<s>  now you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however
distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the
communications you may have with me </s>
<s>  if you have a suspicion in your own
breast keep that suspicion in your own breast </s>
<s>  it is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are </s>
<s>  they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim </s>
<s>  this is not for
you to inquire into </s>
<s>  the condition is laid down </s>
<s>  your acceptance of it
and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition
that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions
and for whom i am not otherwise responsible </s>
<s>  that person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me </s>
<s>  again not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune </s>
<s>  but if you have any objection to it
this is the time to mention it </s>
<s>  speak out </s>
<s> 

once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  now <abvr> pip i have done with stipulations </s>
<s> 
 though he called me <abvr> pip and began rather to make up to me he still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion </s>
<s>  and even now
he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement if he only chose to mention them </s>
<s>  we come next to mere
details of arrangement </s>
<s>  you must know that although i have used
the term �expectations more than once you are not endowed with
expectations only </s>
<s>  there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance </s>
<s>  you will
please consider me your guardian </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  for i was going to thank him i
tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldnt render them </s>
<s> 
it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with
your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage </s>
<s> 

i said i had always longed for it </s>
<s> 

never mind what you have always longed for <abvr> pip he retorted </s>
<s> 
keep to the record </s>
<s>  if you long for it now thats enough </s>
<s>  am i
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor </s>
<s>  is that it </s>
<s> 

i stammered yes that was it </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  now your inclinations are to be consulted </s>
<s>  i dont think that
wise mind but its my trust </s>
<s>  have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another </s>
<s> 

i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and <abvr> wopsles greataunt </s>
<s> 
so i replied in the negative </s>
<s> 

there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think
might suit the purpose said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  i dont recommend him
observe </s>
<s>  because i never recommend anybody </s>
<s>  the gentleman i speak of is
one <abvr> matthew pocket </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i caught at the name directly </s>
<s>  miss havishams relation </s>
<s>  the matthew
whom <abvr> and <abvr> camilla had spoken of </s>
<s>  the matthew whose place was to
be at miss havishams head when she lay dead in her brides dress on
the brides table </s>
<s> 

you know the name </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then
shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer </s>
<s> 

my answer was that i had heard of the name </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  you have heard of the name </s>
<s>  but the question is what do
you say of it </s>
<s> 

i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his
recommendation

no my young friend </s>
<s>  he interrupted shaking his great head very
slowly </s>
<s>  recollect yourself </s>
<s> 

not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him
for his recommendation

no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and
smiling both at onceno no no </s>
<s>  its very well done but it wont
do </s>
<s>  you are too young to fix me with it </s>
<s>  recommendation is not the word
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s>  try another </s>
<s> 

correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention
of <abvr> matthew pocket

thats more like it </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> and i added i would
gladly try that gentleman </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  you had better try him in his own house </s>
<s>  the way shall be
prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london </s>
<s>  when
will you come to london </s>
<s> 

i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i
supposed i could come directly </s>
<s> 

first said <abvr> jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in
and they should not be workingclothes </s>
<s>  say this day week </s>
<s>  youll want
some money </s>
<s>  shall i leave you twenty guineas </s>
<s> 

he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me </s>
<s>  this was the first time he
had taken his leg from the chair </s>
<s>  he sat astride of the chair when he
had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe </s>
<s> 

well joseph gargery </s>
<s>  you look dumbfoundered </s>
<s> 

i am </s>
<s>  said joe in a very decided manner </s>
<s> 

it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember </s>
<s> 

it were understood said joe </s>
<s>  and it are understood </s>
<s>  and it ever will
be similar according </s>
<s> 

but what said <abvr> jaggers swinging his pursewhat if it was in my
instructions to make you a present as compensation </s>
<s> 

as compensation what for </s>
<s>  joe demanded </s>
<s> 

for the loss of his services </s>
<s> 

joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman </s>
<s>  i have
often thought him since like the steamhammer that can crush a man or
pat an eggshell in his combination of strength with gentleness </s>
<s>  pip
is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to
honor and fortun as no words can tell him </s>
<s>  but if you think as money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come
to the forgeand ever the best of friends </s>
<s> 

o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i
see you again with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes
and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away </s>
<s>  o dear good
faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing </s>
<s> 

but i encouraged joe at the time </s>
<s>  i was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together </s>
<s>  i
begged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best
of friends and as i said we ever would be so </s>
<s>  joe scooped his eyes
with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but
said not another word </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognized in joe the
village idiot and in me his keeper </s>
<s>  when it was over he said weighing
in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing </s>
<s> 

now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance </s>
<s>  no half
measures with me </s>
<s>  if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge
to make you speak out and you shall have it </s>
<s>  if on the contrary you
mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joes
suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose </s>
<s> 

which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place
bullbaiting and badgering me come out </s>
<s>  which i meantersay as sech if
youre a man come on </s>
<s>  which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay
and stand or fall by </s>
<s> 

i drew joe away and he immediately became placable </s>
<s>  merely stating to
me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern that he were not a going to be
bullbaited and badgered in his own place </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers had risen when
joe demonstrated and had backed near the door </s>
<s>  without evincing
any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory
remarks </s>
<s>  they were these </s>
<s> 

well <abvr> pip i think the sooner you leave hereas you are to be a
gentlemanthe better </s>
<s>  let it stand for this day week and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime </s>
<s>  you can take a hackneycoach
at the stagecoach office in london and come straight to me </s>
<s> 
understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust
i undertake </s>
<s>  i am paid for undertaking it and i do so </s>
<s>  now understand
that finally </s>
<s>  understand that </s>
<s> 

he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone
on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off </s>
<s> 

something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was
going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he facing round whats the matter </s>
<s> 

i wish to be quite right <abvr> jaggers and to keep to your directions </s>
<s> 
so i thought i had better ask </s>
<s>  would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one i know about here before i go away </s>
<s> 

no said he looking as if he hardly understood me </s>
<s> 

i dont mean in the village only but up town </s>
<s> 

no said he </s>
<s>  no objection </s>
<s> 

i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the
burning coals </s>
<s>  i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals
and nothing was said for a long time </s>
<s> 

my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her
needlework before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe
in the corner opposite my sister </s>
<s>  the more i looked into the glowing
coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe </s>
<s>  the longer the
silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak </s>
<s> 

at length i got out joe have you told biddy </s>
<s> 

no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his
knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip </s>
<s> 

i would rather you told joe </s>
<s> 

pips a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in
it </s>
<s> 

biddy dropped her work and looked at me </s>
<s>  joe held his knees and looked
at me </s>
<s>  i looked at both of them </s>
<s>  after a pause they both heartily
congratulated me </s>
<s>  but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that i rather resented </s>
<s> 

i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with the

nothing about the maker of my fortune </s>
<s>  it would all come out in good
time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save
that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron </s>
<s>  biddy
nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again
and said she would be very particular </s>
<s>  and joe still detaining his
knees said ay ay ill be ekervally partickler pip </s>
<s>  and then they
congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that i didnt half like it </s>
<s> 

infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened </s>
<s>  to the best of my belief those efforts entirely
failed </s>
<s>  she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even
repeated after biddy the words pip and property </s>
<s>  but i doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest
a darker picture of her state of mind </s>
<s> 

i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and
biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy </s>
<s> 
dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be </s>
<s>  but it is
possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied
with myself </s>
<s> 

any how i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand
looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and
about what they should do without me and all that </s>
<s>  and whenever i
caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they
often looked at meparticularly biddy i felt offended </s>
<s>  as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me </s>
<s>  though heaven knows they never did
by word or sign </s>
<s> 

at those times i would get up and look out at the door </s>
<s>  for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room </s>
<s>  the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid
i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which i had passed my life </s>

saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese

<s>  five more days and then the day before the day </s>
<s>  theyll soon
go </s>

yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug </s>

theyll soon go </s>

i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and
order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that ill come and put
them on there or that ill have them sent to <abvr> pumblechooks </s>
<s>  it
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure
too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on
it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices </s>
<s>  so might
wopsle </s>
<s>  and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment </s>

thats just what i dont want joe </s>
<s>  they would make such a business of
itsuch a coarse and common businessthat i couldnt bear myself </s>
<s> 

ah that indeed pip </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  if you couldnt abear yourself

biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sisters plate have you
thought about when youll show yourself to <abvr> gargery and your sister
and me </s>
<s>  you will show yourself to us </s>
<s>  wont you </s>
<s> 

biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick
that its difficult to keep up with you </s>
<s> 

she always were quick observed joe </s>
<s> 

if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say
that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one eveningmost likely
on the evening before i go away </s>
<s> 

biddy said no more </s>
<s>  handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed </s>
<s>  when i got
into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean
little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for
ever </s>
<s>  it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at
the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in
so often between the forge and miss havishams and biddy and estella </s>
<s> 

the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and
the room was warm </s>
<s>  as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw
joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two
in the air </s>
<s>  and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light
it for him </s>
<s>  he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he
wanted comforting for some reason or other </s>
<s> 

he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe
and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they
talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once </s>
<s>  i would not have listened for more if i could
have heard more </s>
<s>  so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever
known </s>
<s> 

looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joes pipe
floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joenot
obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared
together </s>
<s>  i put my light out and crept into bed </s>
<s>  and it was an uneasy
bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more </s>

chapter xix

morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same </s>
<s>  what lay
heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure </s>
<s>  for i could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and
that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone </s>
<s> 

joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our
approaching separation </s>
<s>  but they only referred to it when i did </s>
<s>  after
breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free </s>
<s>  with
all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all </s>
<s> 

after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off
the marshes at once and get them done with </s>
<s>  as i passed the church i
felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after
sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds </s>
<s>  i promised myself that i would do something for them
one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding a pint of ale and a gallon of
condescension upon everybody in the village </s>
<s> 

if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my
companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those
graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled
the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge </s>
<s>  my
comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless
been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might
be veritably dead into the bargain </s>
<s> 

no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these
grazing cattlethough they seemed in their dull manner to wear a
more respectful air now and to face round in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectationsfarewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood
henceforth i was for london and greatness </s>
<s>  not for smiths work in
general and for you </s>
<s>  i made my exultant way to the old battery and
lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended
me for estella fell asleep </s>
<s> 

when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me
smoking his pipe </s>
<s>  he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes and said

as being the last time pip i thought id foller </s>
<s> 

and joe i am very glad you did so </s>
<s> 

thankee pip </s>
<s> 

you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that
i shall never forget you </s>
<s> 

no no pip </s>
<s>  said joe in a comfortable tone im sure of that </s>
<s>  ay
ay old chap </s>
<s>  bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in
a mans mind to be certain on it </s>
<s>  but it took a bit of time to get it
well round the change come so oncommon plump </s>
<s>  didnt it </s>
<s> 

somehow i was not best pleased with joes being so mightily secure of
me </s>
<s>  i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said
it does you credit pip or something of that sort </s>
<s>  therefore i made
no remark on joes first head </s>
<s>  merely saying as to his second that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a
gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i
were one </s>
<s> 

have you though </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  astonishing </s>
<s> 

its a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more
when we had our lessons here </s>
<s>  isnt it </s>
<s> 

well i dont know returned joe </s>
<s>  im so awful dull </s>
<s>  im only master
of my own trade </s>
<s>  it were always a pity as i was so awful dull </s>
<s>  but its
no more of a pity now than it wasthis day twelvemonthdont you
see </s>
<s> 

what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to
do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he
had been better qualified for a rise in station </s>
<s>  he was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to
biddy in preference </s>
<s> 

so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget
her said i had a favor to ask of her </s>
<s> 

and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of
helping joe on a little </s>
<s> 

how helping him on </s>
<s>  asked biddy with a steady sort of glance </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  joe is a dear good fellowin fact i think he is the dearest
fellow that ever livedbut he is rather backward in some things </s>
<s>  for
instance biddy in his learning and his manners </s>
<s> 

although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her
eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me </s>
<s> 

o his manners </s>
<s>  wont his manners do then </s>
<s>  asked biddy plucking a
blackcurrant leaf </s>
<s> 

my dear biddy they do very well here

o </s>
<s>  they do very well here </s>
<s>  interrupted biddy looking closely at the
leaf in her hand </s>
<s> 

hear me outbut if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i
shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would
hardly do him justice </s>
<s> 

and dont you think he knows that </s>
<s>  asked biddy </s>
<s> 

it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me that i said snappishly

biddy what do you mean </s>
<s> 

biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her handsand the
smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lanesaid have you never
considered that he may be proud </s>
<s> 

proud </s>
<s>  i repeated with disdainful emphasis </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and
shaking her head </s>
<s>  pride is not all of one kind

well </s>
<s>  what are you stopping for </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not all of one kind resumed biddy </s>
<s>  he may be too proud to let any
one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well
and with respect </s>
<s>  to tell you the truth i think he is </s>
<s>  though it sounds
bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do </s>
<s> 

now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you </s>
<s>  i did not
expect to see this in you </s>
<s>  you are envious biddy and grudging </s>
<s>  you
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you cant help
showing it </s>
<s> 

if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so </s>
<s>  say so
over and over again if you have the heart to think so </s>
<s> 

if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous
and superior tone </s>
<s>  dont put it off upon me </s>
<s>  i am very sorry to see it
and its aits a bad side of human nature </s>
<s>  i did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of
improving dear joe </s>
<s>  but after this i ask you nothing </s>
<s>  i am extremely
sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated </s>
<s>  its aits a bad side
of human nature </s>
<s> 

whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here
at all times </s>
<s>  and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you </s>
<s>  yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither said biddy turning away her head </s>
<s> 

i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which
sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i
was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and
biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until suppertime </s>
<s>  again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first </s>
<s> 

but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to
biddy and we dropped the subject </s>
<s>  putting on the best clothes i had
i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open
and presented myself before <abvr> trabb the tailor who was having his
breakfast in the parlor behind his shop and who did not think it worth
his while to come out to me but called me into him </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> trabb in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way </s>
<s>  how are
you and what can i do for you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds and was
slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up </s>
<s>  he was a
prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of
his prosperity were put away in it in bags </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb said i its an unpleasant thing to have to mention
because it looks like boasting </s>
<s>  but i have come into a handsome
property </s>
<s> 

a change passed over <abvr> trabb </s>
<s>  he forgot the butter in bed got up from
the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord
bless my soul </s>
<s> 

i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them </s>
<s>  and i want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in </s>
<s>  i wish to pay for them i addedotherwise i
thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money </s>
<s> 

my dear sir said <abvr> trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened
his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow dont hurt me by mentioning that </s>
<s>  may i venture to congratulate
you </s>
<s>  would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabbs boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside </s>
<s> 
when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his
labors by sweeping over me </s>
<s>  he was still sweeping when i came out into
the shop with <abvr> trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any
blacksmith alive or dead </s>
<s> 

hold that noise said <abvr> trabb with the greatest sternness or ill
knock your head off </s>
<s> do me the favor to be seated sir </s>
<s>  now this
 said <abvr> trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under
it to show the gloss is a very sweet article </s>
<s>  i can recommend it for
your purpose sir because it really is extra super </s>
<s>  but you shall
see some others </s>
<s>  give me number four you </s>
<s>  to the boy and with a
dreadfully severe stare </s>
<s>  foreseeing the danger of that miscreants
brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again </s>
<s> 
then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight </s>
<s>  and let
me have none of your tricks here said <abvr> trabb or you shall repent
it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that
it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
fellowtownsmans if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having
worn </s>
<s>  are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said <abvr>
trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself </s>
<s> 

i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of <abvr> trabbs
judgment and reentered the parlor to be measured </s>
<s>  for although <abvr>
trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented
with it he said apologetically that it wouldnt do under existing
circumstances sirwouldnt do at all </s>
<s>  so <abvr> trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor as if i were an estate and he the finest
species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that
i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
pains </s>
<s>  when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to <abvr> pumblechooks on the thursday evening he said with his hand
upon the parlor lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work as a rule </s>
<s>  but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem
it </s>
<s>  good morning sir much obliged </s>
<s> door </s>
<s> 

the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what
it meant </s>
<s>  but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was that it had morally laid upon his back trabbs boy </s>
<s> 

after this memorable event i went to the hatters and the bootmakers
and the hosiers and felt rather like mother hubbards dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades </s>
<s>  i also went to the coachoffice
and took my place for seven oclock on saturday morning </s>
<s>  it was
not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome
property </s>
<s>  but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through
the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me </s>
<s>  when
i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards
pumblechooks and as i approached that gentlemans place of business
i saw him standing at his door </s>
<s> 

he was waiting for me with great impatience </s>
<s>  he had been out early with
the chaisecart and had called at the forge and heard the news </s>
<s>  he had
prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlor and he too ordered
his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed </s>
<s> 

my dear friend said <abvr> pumblechook taking me by both hands when
he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good
fortune </s>
<s>  well deserved well deserved </s>
<s> 

this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself </s>
<s> 

to think said <abvr> pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for
some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this is a proud reward </s>
<s> 

i begged <abvr> pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted on that point </s>
<s> 

my dear young friend said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s>  if you will allow me to
call you so

i murmured certainly and <abvr> pumblechook took me by both hands again

head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph </s>

it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so

and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had
the honor of bringing you up by hand </s>

when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister </s>
<s>  let us
never be blind said <abvr> pumblechook to her faults of temper but it
is to be hoped she meant well </s>
<s> 

at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in
the face </s>
<s>  as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting </s>
<s> 

i mentioned to <abvr> pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes
sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him </s>
<s>  i
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village
and he lauded it to the skies </s>
<s>  there was nobody but himself he
intimated worthy of my confidence andin short might he </s>
<s>  then he
asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend </s>
<s>  if i had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he
never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea </s>
<s>  yet for all that i remember feeling
convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a
sensible practical goodhearted prime fellow </s>
<s> 

by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my
advice in reference to his own affairs </s>
<s>  he mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood </s>
<s>  what alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital </s>
<s> 
those were the two little words more capital </s>
<s>  now it appeared to him
pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a
sleeping partner sirwhich sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine
the booksand walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
pocket to the tune of fifty per centit appeared to him that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property which would be worthy of his attention </s>
<s>  but what did i think </s>
<s> 
he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think </s>
<s>  i gave it
as my opinion </s>
<s>  wait a bit </s>
<s>  the united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands
with me but said he really mustand did </s>
<s> 

we drank all the wine and <abvr> pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep joseph up to the mark i dont know what mark and to
render me efficient and constant service i dont know what service </s>
<s>  he
also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after
having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me
that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common
fortun </s>
<s>  he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now and i said so too </s>
<s>  finally i went out into the air with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road </s>
<s> 

there i was roused by <abvr> pumblechooks hailing me </s>
<s>  he was a long way
down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop </s>
<s>  i stopped and he came up breathless </s>
<s> 

no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech </s>
<s> 
not if i can help it </s>
<s>  this occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part </s>
<s> may i as an old friend and wellwisher </s>
<s> 
may i </s>
<s> 

we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation </s>
<s>  then he blessed
me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the
road </s>
<s>  and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before i pursued my way home </s>
<s> 

i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little
i possessed was adapted to my new station </s>
<s>  but i began packing that same
afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next
morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost </s>
<s> 

so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed </s>
<s>  and on friday morning i
went to <abvr> pumblechooks to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
miss havisham </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechooks own room was given up to me to dress
in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event </s>
<s>  my
clothes were rather a disappointment of course </s>
<s>  probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell
a trifle short of the wearers expectation </s>

new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with <abvr> pumblechooks very limited dressingglass in the

market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off <abvr> pumblechook
was not at home </s>
<s>  i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and
was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing </s>
<s>  this was
all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a
personal disadvantage something like joes in his sunday suit </s>
<s> 

i went circuitously to miss havishams by all the back ways and rang
at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves </s>

she saw me so changed </s>

brown to green and yellow </s>

you </s>

i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say goodbye to

i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went
to ask if i were to be admitted </s>
<s>  after a very short delay she returned
and took me up staring at me all the way </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table leaning on her crutch stick </s>
<s>  the room was lighted as of yore and
at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned </s>
<s>  she was then just
abreast of the rotted bridecake </s>
<s> 

dont go sarah she said </s>
<s>  well pip </s>
<s> 

i start for london miss havisham tomorrow i was exceedingly
careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you </s>

this is a gay figure pip said she making her crutch stick play
round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were
bestowing the finishing gift </s>

i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss
havisham i murmured </s>

yes miss havisham </s>
<s> 

goodbye pip </s>
<s> 

she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to
my lips </s>
<s>  i had not considered how i should take leave of her </s>
<s>  it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this </s>
<s>  she looked at sarah pocket
with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with
both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs </s>
<s> 

sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen
out </s>
<s>  she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree
confounded </s>
<s>  i said goodbye miss pocket </s>
<s>  but she merely stared and
did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken </s>
<s>  clear of the
house i made the best of my way back to pumblechooks took off my new
clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress
carrying itto speak the truthmuch more at my ease too though i had
the bundle to carry </s>
<s> 

and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had
run out fast and were gone and tomorrow looked me in the face more
steadily than i could look at it </s>
<s>  as the six evenings had dwindled
away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more
appreciative of the society of joe and biddy </s>
<s>  on this last evening i
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my
splendor until bedtime </s>
<s>  we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by
the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with </s>
<s>  we were
all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits </s>
<s> 

i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little
handportmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all
alone </s>
<s>  i am afraidsore afraidthat this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to
the coach together </s>
<s>  i had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement </s>
<s>  but when i went up to my little room
on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me
in the morning </s>
<s>  i did not </s>
<s> 

all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places
instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now
pigs now mennever horses </s>
<s>  fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing </s>
<s>  then i got up and
partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in
taking it fell asleep </s>
<s> 

biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not
sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon </s>
<s> 
but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs </s>
<s> 
after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy
called to me that i was late </s>
<s> 

it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it </s>
<s>  i got up from the meal
saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me
well </s>
<s>  i suppose i must be off </s>
<s>  and then i kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed
biddy and threw my arms around joes neck </s>
<s>  then i took up my little
portmanteau and walked out </s>
<s>  the last i saw of them was when i presently
heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old
shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe </s>
<s>  i stopped then to
wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head
crying huskily hooroar </s>
<s>  and biddy put her apron to her face </s>
<s> 

i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had
supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high
street </s>
<s>  i whistled and made nothing of going </s>
<s>  but the village was very
peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to
show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all
beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob i broke into tears </s>
<s>  it was by the fingerpost at the end of the
village and i laid my hand upon it and said goodbye o my dear dear
friend </s>
<s> 

heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts </s>
<s>  i was
better after i had cried than beforemore sorry more aware of my own
ingratitude more gentle </s>
<s>  if i had cried before i should have had joe
with me then </s>
<s> 

so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear
of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at
home and a better parting </s>
<s>  we changed and i had not made up my mind
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back when we changed again </s>
<s>  and while i was occupied
with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe
in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat
high </s>
<s> as if he could possibly be there </s>
<s> 

we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to
go back and i went on </s>
<s>  and the mists had all solemnly risen now and
the world lay spread before me </s>
<s> 

this is the end of the first stage of pips expectations </s>
<s> 

chapter xx

the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours </s>
<s>  it was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by
which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the cross keys wood street cheapside london </s>
<s> 

we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything </s>
<s>  otherwise
while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and
dirty </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had duly sent me his address </s>
<s>  it was little britain and he
had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by
the coachoffice </s>
<s>  nevertheless a hackneycoachman who seemed to have
as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old packed me
up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles </s>
<s>  his getting on his
box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weatherstained
peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags was quite a work of time </s>
<s> 
it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged
things behind for i dont know how many footmen to hold on by and
a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation </s>
<s> 

i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
strawyard it was and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why
the horses nosebags were kept inside when i observed the coachman
beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently </s>
<s>  and stop
we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open
door whereon was painted <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

how much </s>
<s>  i asked the coachman </s>
<s> 

the coachman answered a shillingunless you wish to make it more </s>
<s> 

i naturally said i had no wish to make it more </s>
<s> 

then it must be a shilling observed the coachman </s>
<s>  i dont want to
get into trouble </s>
<s>  i know him </s>
<s>  he darkly closed an eye at <abvr> jaggerss
name and shook his head </s>
<s> 

when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his
mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked was <abvr> jaggers at home </s>
<s> 

he is not returned the clerk </s>
<s>  he is in court at present </s>
<s>  am i
addressing <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

i signified that he was addressing <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers left word would you wait in his room </s>
<s>  he couldnt say how
long he might be having a case on </s>
<s>  but it stands to reason his time
being valuable that he wont be longer than he can help </s>
<s> 

with those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back </s>
<s>  here we found a gentleman with one eye in a
velveteen suit and kneebreeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper </s>
<s> 

go and wait outside mike said the clerk </s>
<s> 

i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used
and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal
place </s>
<s>  the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it </s>
<s>  there were not so many papers about as i
should have expected to see </s>
<s>  and there were some odd objects about that
i should not have expected to seesuch as an old rusty pistol a
sword in a scabbard several strangelooking boxes and packages and
two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy
about the nose </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggerss own highbacked chair was of deadly black
horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin </s>
<s>  and i
fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at
the clients </s>
<s>  the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall </s>
<s>  the wall especially opposite to
mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss chair being greasy with shoulders </s>
<s>  i recalled too that
the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was
the innocent cause of his being turned out </s>
<s> 

i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against <abvr> jaggerss
chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place </s>
<s>  i
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody elses disadvantage as his master had </s>
<s>  i wondered how many
other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures </s>
<s>  i wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came
there </s>
<s>  i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of <abvr> jaggerss
family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
illlooking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home </s>
<s> 
of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything </s>
<s>  but i sat wondering and waiting in <abvr>
jaggerss close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above <abvr> jaggerss chair and got up and went out </s>
<s> 

when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i
waited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into
smithfield </s>
<s>  so i came into smithfield </s>
<s>  and the shameful place being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me </s>
<s>  so
i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
i saw the great black dome of saint pauls bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison </s>
<s>  following
the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles </s>
<s>  and from this and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred
that the trials were on </s>
<s> 

while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a
trial or so </s>
<s>  informing me that he could give me a front place for half a
crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in
his wig and robesmentioning that awful personage like waxwork and
presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence </s>
<s>  as i
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also
where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors
door out of which culprits came to be hanged </s>
<s>  heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on �em
 would come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the
morning to be killed in a row </s>
<s>  this was horrible and gave me a
sickening idea of london </s>
<s>  the more so as the lord chief justices
proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
pockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had
bought cheap of the executioner </s>
<s>  under these circumstances i thought
myself well rid of him for a shilling </s>
<s> 

i dropped into the office to ask if <abvr> jaggers had come in yet and i
found he had not and i strolled out again </s>
<s>  this time i made the tour
of little britain and turned into bartholomew close </s>
<s>  and now i became
aware that other people were waiting about for <abvr> jaggers as well
as i </s>
<s>  there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew
close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me that jaggers would do it if it was to be done </s>
<s> 
 there was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and
one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted
her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders jaggers
is for him �melia and what more could you have </s>
<s>  there was a redeyed
little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in
company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand </s>
<s>  and
while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly
excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamppost and
accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words o jaggerth
jaggerth jaggerth </s>
<s>  all otherth ith cagmaggerth give me jaggerth </s>
<s> 
 these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever </s>
<s> 

at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close
into little britain i saw <abvr> jaggers coming across the road towards
me </s>
<s>  all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there
was quite a rush at him </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed
himself to his followers </s>
<s> 

first he took the two secret men </s>
<s> 

now i have nothing to say to you said <abvr> jaggers throwing his
finger at them </s>
<s>  i want to know no more than i know </s>
<s>  as to the result
its a tossup </s>
<s>  i told you from the first it was a tossup </s>
<s>  have you
paid wemmick </s>
<s> 

we made the money up this morning sir said one of the men
submissively while the other perused <abvr> jaggerss face </s>
<s> 

i dont ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it
up at all </s>
<s>  has wemmick got it </s>
<s> 

yes sir said both the men together </s>
<s>

<s>  then you may go </s>
<s>  now i wont have it </s>
<s>  said mr jaggers
waving his hand at them to put them behind him </s>
<s>  if you say a word to

<s>

<s>  if i want you i know where to

<s>  i dont want you to find me </s>
<s>  now i wont have it </s>
<s>  i wont hear

<s> 

the two men looked at one another as <abvr> jaggers waved them behind
again and humbly fell back and were heard no more </s>
<s> 

and now you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on
the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly
separatedoh </s>
<s>  amelia is it </s>
<s> 

yes <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

and do you remember retorted <abvr> jaggers that but for me you
wouldnt be here and couldnt be here </s>

o yes sir </s>
<s>  exclaimed both women together </s>
<s>  lord bless you sir well

<s> 

then why said <abvr> jaggers do you come here </s>
<s>

<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  then you have done all you have got to do </s>

this terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately </s>
<s> 
no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the
skirts of <abvr> jaggerss coat to his lips several times </s>

my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and
left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot </s>
<s>  without further
interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap </s>
<s> 

heres mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and
approaching <abvr> jaggers confidentially </s>

oh </s>

the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious

elbow </s>
<s>  soft head </s>
<s>  need you say it face to face </s>

now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly
once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is

<s> 

mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson
from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having
been in his company and never left him all the night in question </s>
<s> 

now be careful </s>
<s>  in what station of life is this man </s>
<s> 

mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the
ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner weve dressed him up like
 when my guardian blustered out

what </s>
<s>  you will will you </s>
<s> 

spooney </s>
<s>  added the clerk again with another stir </s>
<s> 

after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again </s>
<s> 

he is dressed like a �spectable pieman </s>
<s>  a sort of a pastrycook </s>
<s> 

is he here </s>
<s>  asked my guardian </s>
<s> 

i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner </s>
<s> 

take him past that window and let me see him </s>
<s> 

the window indicated was the office window </s>
<s>  we all three went to
it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner with a murderouslooking tall individual in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap </s>
<s>  this guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery
which was painted over </s>
<s> 

tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the
clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a
fellow as that </s>
<s> 

my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched
standing from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to
bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he
had made for me </s>
<s>  i was to go to barnards inn to young <abvr> pockets
rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation </s>
<s>  i was to
remain with young <abvr> pocket until monday </s>
<s>  on monday i was to go with
him to his fathers house on a visit that i might try how i liked it </s>
<s> 
also i was told what my allowance was to beit was a very liberal
oneand had handed to me from one of my guardians drawers the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes
and such other things as i could in reason want </s>
<s>  you will find your
credit good <abvr> pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by
this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you
outrunning the constable </s>
<s>  of course youll go wrong somehow but thats
no fault of mine </s>
<s> 

after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers if i could send for a coach </s>
<s>  he said it was not worth while
i was so near my destination </s>
<s>  wemmick should walk round with me if i
pleased </s>
<s> 

i then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room </s>
<s>  another clerk
was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i
accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian </s>
<s> 
we found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you its no use </s>
<s>  he
wont have a word to say to one of you </s>
<s>  and we soon got clear of them
and went on side by side </s>

chapter xxi

casting my eyes on <abvr> wemmick as we went along to see what he was
like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in
stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel </s>
<s>  there were some marks
in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints </s>
<s>  the chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off </s>
<s>  i judged him
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements </s>
<s>  for he wore at least four
mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it </s>
<s>  i noticed too that several rings
and seals hung at his watchchain as if he were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends </s>
<s>  he had glittering eyessmall keen
and blackand thin wide mottled lips </s>
<s>  he had had them to the best of
my belief from forty to fifty years </s>
<s> 

so you were never in london before </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmick to me </s>
<s>

i was new here once said <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  rum to think of now </s>
<s> 

you are well acquainted with it now </s>
<s> 

why yes said <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  i know the moves of it </s>
<s> 

is it a very wicked place </s>
<s>  i asked more for the sake of saying
something than for information </s>
<s> 

you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london </s>
<s>  but there are
plenty of people anywhere wholl do that for you </s>
<s> 

if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a
little </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  i dont know about bad blood returned <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  theres not
much bad blood about </s>
<s>  theyll do it if theres anything to be got by
it </s>
<s> 

that makes it worse </s>
<s> 

you think so </s>
<s>  returned <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  much about the same i should
say </s>
<s> 

he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him </s>
<s> 
walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his attention </s>
<s>  his mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth
that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling </s>
<s>  we had got to the top of
holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance
and that he was not smiling at all </s>
<s> 

do you know where <abvr> matthew pocket lives </s>
<s>  i asked <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

yes said he nodding in the direction </s>
<s>  at hammersmith west of
london </s>
<s> 

is that far </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  say five miles </s>
<s> 

do you know him </s>
<s> 

why youre a regular crossexaminer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmick looking at me
with an approving air </s>
<s>  yes i know him </s>
<s>  i know him </s>
<s> 

there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
these words that rather depressed me </s>
<s>  and i was still looking sideways
at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text
when he said here we were at barnards inn </s>
<s>  my depression was not
alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by <abvr> barnard to which the blue boar in our town
was a mere publichouse </s>
<s>  whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied
spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
tomcats </s>
<s> 

we entered this haven through a wicketgate and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat buryingground </s>
<s>  i thought it had the most dismal trees in
it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most
dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen </s>
<s>  i
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled
flowerpot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift </s>
<s>  while
to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new
wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel </s>
<s>  a frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn
ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dusthole </s>
<s>  thus far my sense of sight </s>
<s>  while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellarrot of rat
and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand besidesaddressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnards
mixture </s>
<s> 

so imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations
that i looked in dismay at <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  said he mistaking me </s>
<s> 
the retirement reminds you of the country </s>
<s>  so it does me </s>
<s> 

he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairswhich
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming downto a set of chambers on
the top floor </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket jun </s>
<s>  was painted on the door and there was
a label on the letterbox return shortly </s>
<s> 

he hardly thought youd come so soon <abvr> wemmick explained </s>
<s>  you
dont want me any more </s>
<s> 

no thank you said i </s>
<s> 

as i keep the cash <abvr> wemmick observed we shall most likely meet
pretty often </s>
<s>  good day </s>
<s> 

good day </s>
<s> 

i put out my hand and <abvr> wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought i wanted something </s>
<s>  then he looked at me and said correcting
himself

to be sure </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  youre in the habit of shaking hands </s>
<s> 

i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion
but said yes </s>
<s> 

i have got so out of it </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmickexcept at last </s>
<s>  very
glad im sure to make your acquaintance </s>
<s>  good day </s>
<s> 

when we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it
came down like the guillotine </s>
<s>  happily it was so quick that i had not
put my head out </s>
<s>  after this escape i was content to take a foggy view
of the inn through the windows encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully
looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket juniors idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window before i heard footsteps on the stairs </s>
<s>  gradually there arose
before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a
member of society of about my own standing </s>
<s>  he had a paperbag under
each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of
breath </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  he exclaimed </s>
<s>  i am extremely sorry </s>
<s>  but i knew there was a
coach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would
come by that one </s>
<s>  the fact is i have been out on your accountnot
that that is any excusefor i thought coming from the country you
might like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden
market to get it good </s>
<s> 

for a reason that i had i felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head </s>
<s>  i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this
was a dream </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pocket junior </s>
<s>  this door sticks so </s>
<s> 

as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paperbags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold
them </s>
<s>  he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast </s>
<s>  it yielded so suddenly at last
that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite
door and we both laughed </s>
<s>  but still i felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head and as if this must be a dream </s>
<s> 

pray come in said <abvr> pocket junior </s>
<s>  allow me to lead the way </s>
<s>  i am
rather bare here but i hope youll be able to make out tolerably well
till monday </s>
<s>  my father thought you would get on more agreeably through
tomorrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about
london </s>
<s>  i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you </s>
<s>  as to our
table you wont find that bad i hope for it will be supplied from our
coffeehouse here and it is only right i should add at your expense
such being <abvr> jaggerss directions </s>
<s>  as to our lodging its not by
any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my father
hasnt anything to give me and i shouldnt be willing to take it if he
had </s>
<s>  this is our sittingroomjust such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth you see as they could spare from home </s>
<s>  you mustnt give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come
for you from the coffeehouse </s>
<s>  this is my little bedroom </s>

but barnards is musty </s>
<s>  this is your bedroom </s>
<s>  the furnitures hired for
the occasion but i trust it will answer the purpose </s>

anything ill go and fetch it </s>

be alone together but we shant fight i dare say </s>
<s>  but dear me i beg
your pardon youre holding the fruit all this time </s>
<s>  pray let me take
these bags from you </s>
<s>  i am quite ashamed </s>
<s> 

as i stood opposite to <abvr> pocket junior delivering him the bags one
two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that i knew to
be in mine and he said falling back

lord bless me youre the prowling boy </s>
<s> 

and you said i are the pale young gentleman </s>

chapter xxii

the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in
barnards inn until we both burst out laughing </s>
<s>  the idea of its
being you </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  the idea of its being you </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  and then we
contemplated one another afresh and laughed again </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  said the
pale young gentleman reaching out his hand goodhumoredly its all
over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me
for having knocked you about so </s>
<s> 

i derived from this speech that <abvr> herbert pocket for herbert was the
pale young gentlemans name still rather confounded his intention with
his execution </s>
<s>  but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly </s>
<s> 

you hadnt come into your good fortune at that time </s>
<s>  said herbert
pocket </s>
<s> 

no said i </s>
<s> 

no he acquiesced </s>
<s>  i heard it had happened very lately </s>
<s>  i was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to
me </s>
<s>  but she couldntat all events she didnt </s>
<s> 

i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that </s>
<s> 

bad taste said herbert laughing but a fact </s>
<s>  yes she had sent for
me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i
suppose i should have been provided for </s>
<s>  perhaps i should have been
whatyoumaycalled it to estella </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  i asked with sudden gravity </s>
<s> 

he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his
attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word </s>
<s> 
affianced he explained still busy with the fruit </s>
<s>  betrothed </s>
<s> 
engaged </s>
<s>  whatshisnamed </s>
<s>  any word of that sort </s>
<s> 

how did you bear your disappointment </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said he i didnt care much for it </s>
<s>  shes a tartar </s>
<s> 

miss havisham </s>
<s> 

i dont say no to that but i meant estella </s>
<s>  that girls hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by
miss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex </s>
<s> 

what relation is she to miss havisham </s>
<s> 

none said he </s>
<s>  only adopted </s>
<s> 

why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex </s>
<s>  what revenge </s>
<s> 

lord <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  dont you know </s>
<s> 

no said i </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  its quite a story and shall be saved till dinnertime </s>
<s>  and
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question </s>
<s>  how did you come
there that day </s>
<s> 

i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst
out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards </s>
<s>  i didnt
ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers is your guardian i understand </s>
<s>  he went on </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

you know he is miss havishams man of business and solicitor and has
her confidence when nobody else has </s>
<s> 

this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground </s>
<s>  i answered with
a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen <abvr> jaggers
in miss havishams house on the very day of our combat but never at any
other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there </s>
<s> 

he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he
called on my father to propose it </s>
<s>  of course he knew about my father
from his connection with miss havisham </s>
<s>  my father is miss havishams
cousin </s>
<s>  not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her </s>
<s> 

herbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking </s>
<s> 
i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since
who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean </s>
<s>  there was something
wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the
same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich </s>
<s>  i
dont know how this was </s>
<s>  i became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what
means </s>
<s> 

he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor
about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem
indicative of natural strength </s>
<s>  he had not a handsome face but it was
better than handsome </s>
<s>  being extremely amiable and cheerful </s>
<s>  his figure
was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and
young </s>
<s>  whether <abvr> trabbs local work would have sat more gracefully on
him than on me may be a question </s>
<s>  but i am conscious that he carried
off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit </s>
<s> 

as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years </s>
<s>  i therefore told him my small story
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was </s>
<s> 
i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would
take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever
he saw me at a loss or going wrong </s>
<s> 

with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that youll want
very few hints </s>
<s>  i dare say we shall be often together and i should like
to banish any needless restraint between us </s>
<s>  will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert </s>
<s> 

i thanked him and said i would </s>
<s>  i informed him in exchange that my
christian name was philip </s>
<s> 

i dont take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spellingbook who was so lazy that he fell into a pond
or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes or so avaricious that
he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a
birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood </s>
<s>  i tell you what i should like </s>
<s>  we are so harmonious and
you have been a blacksmithwould you mind it </s>
<s> 

i shouldnt mind anything that you propose i answered but i dont
understand you </s>
<s> 

would you mind handel for a familiar name </s>
<s>  theres a charming piece of
music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith </s>
<s> 

i should like it very much </s>
<s> 

then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened
here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table
because the dinner is of your providing </s>
<s> 

this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him </s>
<s>  it was a
nice little dinnerseemed to me then a very lord mayors feastand
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances with no old people by and with london all around us </s>
<s> 
this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off </s>
<s>  for while the table was as <abvr> pumblechook might have
said the lap of luxurybeing entirely furnished forth from the
coffeehousethe circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character </s>
<s>  imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he
fell over them the melted butter in the armchair the bread on the
bookshelves the cheese in the coalscuttle and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next roomwhere i found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when i retired for the night </s>
<s>  all this made the
feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my
pleasure was without alloy </s>
<s> 

we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his
promise to tell me about miss havisham </s>
<s> 

true he replied </s>
<s>  ill redeem it at once </s>
<s>  let me introduce the topic
handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouthfor fear of accidentsand that while the fork is
reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary </s>
<s>  it is
scarcely worth mentioning only its as well to do as other people do </s>
<s> 
also the spoon is not generally used overhand but under </s>
<s>  this has
two advantages </s>
<s>  you get at your mouth better which after all is the
object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on
the part of the right elbow </s>
<s> 

he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both
laughed and i scarcely blushed </s>
<s> 

now he pursued concerning miss havisham </s>
<s>  miss havisham you must
know was a spoilt child </s>
<s>  her mother died when she was a baby and her
father denied her nothing </s>
<s>  her father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world and was a brewer </s>
<s>  i dont know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer </s>
<s>  but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was
and brew </s>
<s>  you see it every day </s>
<s> 

yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse </s>
<s>  may he </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not on any account returned herbert </s>
<s>  but a publichouse may keep a
gentleman </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  <abvr> havisham was very rich and very proud </s>
<s>  so was his
daughter </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was an only child </s>
<s>  i hazarded </s>
<s> 

stop a moment i am coming to that </s>
<s>  no she was not an only child </s>
<s> 
she had a halfbrother </s>
<s>  her father privately married againhis cook i
rather think </s>
<s> 

i thought he was proud said i </s>
<s> 

my good handel so he was </s>
<s>  he married his second wife privately
because he was proud and in course of time she died </s>
<s>  when she was dead
i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then
the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are
acquainted with </s>
<s>  as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous
extravagant undutifulaltogether bad </s>
<s>  at last his father disinherited
him </s>
<s>  but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though
not nearly so well off as miss havisham </s>
<s> take another glass of wine
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose </s>
<s> 

i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital </s>
<s>  i
thanked him and apologized </s>
<s>  he said not at all and resumed </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match </s>
<s>  her halfbrother had now ample means again but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again </s>
<s> 
there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been
between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fathers anger </s>
<s> 
now i come to the cruel part of the storymerely breaking off my
dear handel to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a tumbler </s>
<s> 

why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to
say </s>
<s>  i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits </s>
<s>  again i thanked him and apologized and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure </s>
<s>  and resumed </s>
<s> 

there appeared upon the scenesay at the races or the public
balls or anywhere else you likea certain man who made love to miss
havisham </s>
<s>  i never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago
before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that
he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose </s>
<s>  but that he was
not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my
father most strongly asseverates </s>
<s>  because it is a principle of his that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world
began a true gentleman in manner </s>
<s>  he says no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood </s>
<s>  and that the more varnish you put on the more the
grain will express itself </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  this man pursued miss havisham closely
and professed to be devoted to her </s>
<s>  i believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time </s>
<s>  but all the susceptibility she possessed
certainly came out then and she passionately loved him </s>
<s>  there is no
doubt that she perfectly idolized him </s>
<s>  he practised on her affection in
that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he
induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had
been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea
that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all </s>
<s>  your
guardian was not at that time in miss havishams counsels and she was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one </s>
<s>  her relations
were poor and scheming with the exception of my father </s>
<s>  he was poor
enough but not timeserving or jealous </s>
<s>  the only independent one among
them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his power </s>
<s>  she took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his
presence and my father has never seen her since </s>
<s> 

i thought of her having said matthew will come and see me at last when
i am laid dead upon that table </s>
<s>  and i asked herbert whether his father
was so inveterate against her </s>
<s> 

its not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her
intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would
look trueeven to himand even to her </s>
<s>  to return to the man and make
an end of him </s>
<s>  the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were
bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were
invited </s>
<s>  the day came but not the bridegroom </s>
<s>  he wrote her a letter

which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her
marriage </s>
<s>  at twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

at the hour and minute said herbert nodding at which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks </s>
<s>  what was in it further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i cant tell you because i
dont know </s>
<s>  when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she
laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since
looked upon the light of day </s>
<s> 

is that all the story </s>
<s>  i asked after considering it </s>
<s> 

all i know of it </s>
<s>  and indeed i only know so much through piecing it
out for myself </s>
<s>  for my father always avoids it and even when miss
havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite i should understand </s>
<s>  but i have forgotten one
thing </s>
<s>  it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother </s>
<s>  that it
was a conspiracy between them </s>
<s>  and that they shared the profits </s>
<s> 

i wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property said i </s>
<s> 

he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her halfbrothers scheme said herbert </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  i dont
know that </s>
<s> 

what became of the two men </s>
<s>  i asked after again considering the
subject </s>
<s> 

they fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be
deeperand ruin </s>
<s> 

are they alive now </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s> 

you said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but
adopted </s>
<s>  when adopted </s>
<s> 

herbert shrugged his shoulders </s>
<s>  there has always been an estella since
i have heard of a miss havisham </s>
<s>  i know no more </s>
<s>  and now handel said
he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly
open understanding between us </s>
<s>  all that i know about miss havisham you
know </s>
<s> 

and all that i know i retorted you know </s>
<s> 

i fully believe it </s>
<s>  so there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me </s>
<s>  and as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in lifenamely that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe ityou may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me </s>
<s> 

in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject
done with even though i should be under his fathers roof for years and
years to come </s>
<s>  yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt
he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as i
understood the fact myself </s>
<s> 

it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way </s>
<s>  but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this
to be the case </s>
<s>  we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the
course of conversation what he was </s>
<s>  he replied a capitalistan
insurer of ships </s>
<s>  i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city </s>
<s> 

i had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in
the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer
on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible
head open </s>
<s>  but again there came upon me for my relief that odd
impression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich </s>
<s> 

i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships </s>
<s>  i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the
direction </s>
<s>  i shall also do a little in the mining way </s>
<s>  none of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account </s>
<s>  i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to
the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious
woods </s>
<s>  its an interesting trade </s>
<s> 

and the profits are large </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

tremendous </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own </s>
<s> 

i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his
waistcoat pockets to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum </s>
<s> 
also to ceylon specially for elephants tusks </s>
<s> 

you will want a good many ships said i </s>
<s> 

a perfect fleet said he </s>
<s> 

quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him
where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present </s>
<s> 

i havent begun insuring yet he replied </s>
<s>  i am looking about me </s>
<s> 

somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnards inn </s>
<s>  i said
in a tone of conviction ahh </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i am in a countinghouse and looking about me </s>
<s> 

is a countinghouse profitable </s>

todo you mean to the young fellow whos in it </s>
<s>  he asked in reply </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  to you </s>
<s> 

why nno </s>
<s>  not to me </s>
<s>  he said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance </s>
<s>  not directly profitable </s>
<s>  that is
it doesnt pay me anything and i have tokeep myself </s>
<s> 

this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as
if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income </s>
<s> 

but the thing is said herbert pocket that you look about you </s>
<s> 
thats the grand thing </s>
<s>  you are in a countinghouse you know and you
look about you </s>
<s> 

it struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a
countinghouse you know and look about you </s>
<s>  but i silently deferred to
his experience </s>
<s> 

then the time comes said herbert when you see your opening </s>
<s>  and you
go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there
you are </s>
<s>  when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do
but employ it </s>
<s> 

this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden </s>
<s> 
very like </s>
<s>  his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded
to his manner of bearing that defeat </s>
<s>  it seemed to me that he took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine
then </s>
<s>  it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest
necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else </s>
<s> 

yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so
unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being
puffed up </s>
<s>  it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways
and we got on famously </s>
<s>  in the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets and went halfprice to the theatre </s>
<s>  and next day we went to
church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the
parks </s>
<s>  and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe did </s>
<s> 

on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had
left joe and biddy </s>
<s>  the space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off </s>
<s>  that i could
have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes on the very
last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities
geographical and social solar and lunar </s>
<s>  yet in the london streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away </s>
<s>  and in the dead of night the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnards inn
under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart </s>
<s> 

on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to
the countinghouse to report himselfto look about him too i
supposeand i bore him company </s>
<s>  he was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him </s>
<s>  it
appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning </s>
<s>  nor
did the countinghouse where herbert assisted show in my eyes as at
all a good observatory </s>
<s>  being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy
presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second
floor rather than a look out </s>
<s> 

i waited about until it was noon and i went upon �change and i saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to
be great merchants though i couldnt understand why they should all be
out of spirits </s>
<s>  when herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing
even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters clothes than in the steaks </s>
<s>  this collation disposed of at
a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we
went back to barnards inn and got my little portmanteau and then took
coach for hammersmith </s>
<s>  we arrived there at two or three oclock in
the afternoon and had very little way to walk to <abvr> pockets house </s>
<s> 
lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river where <abvr> pockets children were playing
about </s>
<s>  and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that <abvr> and <abvr>
pockets children were not growing up or being brought up but were
tumbling up </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with
her legs upon another garden chair </s>
<s>  and <abvr> pockets two nursemaids
were looking about them while the children played </s>
<s>  mamma said
herbert this is young <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  upon which <abvr> pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity </s>
<s> 

master alick and miss jane cried one of the nurses to two of the
children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes youll fall over
into the river and be drownded and whatll your pa say then </s>
<s> 

at the same time this nurse picked up <abvr> pockets handkerchief and
said if that dont make six times youve dropped it mum </s>
<s>  upon which
mrs </s>
<s>  pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself
in one chair only resumed her book </s>
<s>  her countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week
but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes
upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well </s>
<s>  this unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  she cried picking up the pockethandkerchief if that dont
make seven times </s>
<s>  what are you a doing of this afternoon mum </s>
<s>  <abvr>
pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of
recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on
reading </s>
<s> 

i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than
six little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up </s>
<s>  i had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region
of air wailing dolefully </s>
<s> 

if there aint baby </s>
<s>  said flopson appearing to think it most
surprising </s>
<s>  make haste up millers </s>
<s> 

millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees
the childs wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket read all the
time and i was curious to know what the book could be </s>
<s> 

we were waiting i supposed for <abvr> pocket to come out to us </s>
<s>  at any
rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near <abvr> pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over heralways very much to her momentary astonishment and
their own more enduring lamentation </s>
<s>  i was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby
which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to <abvr>
pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over <abvr> pocket baby
and all and was caught by herbert and myself </s>
<s> 

gracious me flopson </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pocket looking off her book for a
moment everybodys tumbling </s>
<s> 

gracious you indeed mum </s>
<s>  returned flopson very red in the face </s>
<s> 
what have you got there </s>
<s> 

i got here flopson </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> pocket </s>
<s> 

why if it aint your footstool </s>
<s>  cried flopson </s>
<s>  and if you keep it
under your skirts like that whos to help tumbling </s>
<s>  here </s>
<s>  take the
baby mum and give me your book </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her lap while the other children played about it </s>
<s>  this had
lasted but a very short time when <abvr> pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap </s>
<s>  thus i made the
second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little
pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down </s>
<s> 

under these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the children
into the house like a little flock of sheep and <abvr> pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that <abvr>
pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and
with his very gray hair disordered on his head as if he didnt quite
see his way to putting anything straight </s>

chapter xxiii

mr </s>

see him </s>

an alarming personage </s>
<s>  he was a younglooking man in spite of
his perplexities and his very gray hair and his manner seemed quite
natural </s>
<s>  i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected </s>
<s> 
there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very
near being so </s>
<s>  when he had talked with me a little he said to <abvr>
pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were
black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  and she
looked up from her book and said yes </s>
<s>  she then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orangeflower
water </s>
<s>  as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone
or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like
her previous approaches in general conversational condescension </s>
<s> 

i found out within a few hours and may mention at once that <abvr>
pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
father would have been made a baronet but for somebodys determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motivesi forget whose
if i ever knewthe sovereigns the prime ministers the lord
chancellors the archbishop of canterburys anybodysand had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact </s>
<s>  i believe he had been knighted himself for storming
the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the
trowel or the mortar </s>
<s>  be that as it may he had directed <abvr> pocket to
be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge </s>
<s> 

so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but
perfectly helpless and useless </s>
<s>  with her character thus happily formed
in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered <abvr> pocket </s>
<s>  who was
also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount
to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre </s>
<s>  as his doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time he and <abvr> pocket had
taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would
seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent </s>
<s>  the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle and had informed <abvr> pocket that his wife was a
treasure for a prince </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket had invested the princes treasure
in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest </s>
<s>  still <abvr> pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married
a title </s>
<s>  while <abvr> pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach because he had never got one </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket took me into the house and showed me my room </s>
<s>  which was a
pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for
my own private sittingroom </s>
<s>  he then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle
and startop </s>
<s>  drummle an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of
architecture was whistling </s>
<s>  startop younger in years and appearance
was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge </s>
<s> 

both <abvr> and <abvr> pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
elses hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the
servants </s>
<s>  it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving
trouble </s>
<s>  but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs </s>
<s>  they allowed a very
liberal table to <abvr> and <abvr> pocket yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchenalways supposing the boarder capable of selfdefence for
before i had been there a week a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers
slapping the baby </s>
<s>  this greatly distressed <abvr> pocket who burst into
tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldnt mind their own business </s>
<s> 

by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that <abvr> pocket had been
educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself </s>
<s> 
but that when he had had the happiness of marrying <abvr> pocket very
early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling
of a grinder </s>

london </s>
<s>  here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> pocket had a toady neighbor </s>
<s>  a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody

<s>  this
ladys name was <abvr> coiler and i had the honor of taking her down to
dinner on the day of my installation </s>
<s>  she gave me to understand on the
stairs that it was a blow to dear <abvr> pocket that dear <abvr> pocket
should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him </s>
<s> 
that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence
at that time i had known her something less than five minutes </s>
<s>  if

disappointment not that dear <abvr> pocket was to blame in that requires
so much luxury and elegance

yes maam i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to
cry </s>

i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butchers time

manners </s>
<s> 

it came to my knowledge through what passed between <abvr> pocket and
drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and
other instruments of selfdestruction that drummle whose christian
name was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy </s>
<s> 
it further appeared that the book i had seen <abvr> pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which
her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all </s>

drummle didnt say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognized <abvr> pocket
as a woman and a sister </s>
<s>  no one but themselves and <abvr> coiler the toady
neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it
appeared to me that it was painful to herbert </s>

a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction </s>
<s>  it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef </s>
<s>  to my
unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw <abvr> pocket
relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and
with which i soon became as familiar as the rest </s>
<s>  he laid down the
carvingknife and forkbeing engaged in carving at the momentput
his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it </s>
<s>  when he had done this
and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he
was about </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me </s>
<s>  i liked
it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over </s>
<s>  she had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities i had left which was altogether snaky and forktongued </s>
<s>  and
when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to
her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table </s>

after dinner the children were introduced and <abvr> coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes noses and legsa sagacious way of improving
their minds </s>
<s>  there were four little girls and two little boys besides
the baby who might have been either and the babys next successor who
was as yet neither </s>
<s>  they were brought in by flopson and millers much as

to make of them </s>

upon the table </s>

concussion </s>

one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place
by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and
laughed </s>

meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed

flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll

to play with </s>
<s>  at the same time recommending <abvr> pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its

two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost
half his buttons at the gamingtable </s>

i was made very uneasy in my mind by <abvr> pockets falling into a
discussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the
baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers </s>

length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly

any decided acquaintance </s>

minutes being nursed by little jane </s>

it happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinnertable through flopsons having some private engagement and

mutual relations between them and <abvr> pocket which were exemplified in
the following manner </s>

circumstances </s>
<s>  i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary </s>

mine with him </s>

not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could

this was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture o more than
that </s>

more than that eh </s>

his hands in his pockets his head on one side and his eyes on the wall
behind me </s>

it is so difficult to fix a sum said i hesitating </s>

i suppose you make it twenty pounds said i smiling </s>

never mind what i make it my friend observed <abvr> jaggers with a
knowing and contradictory toss of his head </s>

make it </s>
<s> 

twenty pounds of course </s>
<s> 

wemmick </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers opening his office door </s>
<s>  take <abvr> pips
written order and pay him twenty pounds </s>
<s> 

this strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers never
laughed </s>
<s>  but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising
himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows
joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to
creak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way </s>
<s>  as he happened
to go out now and as wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to wemmick
that i hardly knew what to make of <abvr> jaggerss manner </s>
<s> 

tell him that and hell take it as a compliment answered wemmick </s>
<s> 
he dont mean that you should know what to make of it </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  for
i looked surprised its not personal </s>
<s>  its professional </s>
<s>  only
professional </s>
<s> 

wemmick was at his desk lunchingand crunchingon a dry hard biscuit </s>
<s> 
pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as
if he were posting them </s>
<s> 

always seems to me said wemmick as if he had set a mantrap and was
watching it </s>
<s>  suddenlyclickyoure caught </s>
<s> 

without remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life i
said i supposed he was very skilful </s>
<s> 

deep said wemmick as australia </s>
<s>  pointing with his pen at the
office floor to express that australia was understood for the purposes
of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe </s>
<s> 
if there was anything deeper added wemmick bringing his pen to
paper hed be it </s>
<s> 

then i said i supposed he had a fine business and wemmick said
capital </s>
<s>  then i asked if there were many clerks </s>
<s>  to which he
replied

we dont run much into clerks because theres only one jaggers and
people wont have him at second hand </s>
<s>  there are only four of us </s>
<s>  would
you like to see �em </s>
<s>  you are one of us as i may say </s>
<s> 

i accepted the offer </s>
<s>  when <abvr> wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
post and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe the key

coatcollar like an ironpigtail we went upstairs </s>
<s>  the house was dark
and shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in <abvr>
jaggerss room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
for years </s>
<s>  in the front first floor a clerk who looked something
between a publican and a ratcatchera large pale puffed swollen
manwas attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
be treated who contributed to <abvr> jaggerss coffers </s>
<s>  getting evidence
together said <abvr> wemmick as we came out for the bailey </s>
<s>  in the
room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was
similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom <abvr> wemmick presented
to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt
me anything i pleasedand who was in an excessive whiteperspiration
as if he had been trying his art on himself </s>
<s>  in a back room a
highshouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel who was
dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of
the other two gentlemen for <abvr> jaggerss own use </s>
<s> 

this was all the establishment </s>
<s>  when we went downstairs again wemmick
led me into my guardians room and said this youve seen already </s>
<s> 

pray said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again whose likenesses are those </s>
<s> 

these </s>
<s>  said wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off
the horrible heads before bringing them down </s>
<s>  these are two celebrated
ones </s>
<s>  famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit </s>
<s>  this chap
why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
inkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal </s>

his master and considering that he wasnt brought up to evidence
didnt plan it badly </s>

is it like him </s>
<s>  i asked recoiling from the brute as wemmick spat
upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve </s>
<s> 

like him </s>
<s>  its himself you know </s>
<s>  the cast was made in newgate
directly after he was taken down </s>
<s>  you had a particular fancy for
me hadnt you old artful </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  he then explained this
affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady
and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying
had it made for me express </s>
<s> 

is the lady anybody </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

no returned wemmick </s>
<s>  only his game </s>
<s>  you liked your bit of game
didnt you </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  deuce a bit of a lady in the case <abvr> pip except
oneand she wasnt of this slender ladylike sort and you wouldnt
have caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to
drink in it </s>
<s>  wemmicks attention being thus directed to his brooch he
put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s> 

did that other creature come to the same end </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s>  he has the
same look </s>
<s> 

youre right said wemmick </s>
<s>  its the genuine look </s>
<s>  much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook </s>
<s>  yes
he came to the same end </s>
<s>  quite the natural end here i assure you </s>
<s> 
he forged wills this blade did if he didnt also put the supposed
testators to sleep too </s>
<s>  you were a gentlemanly cove though <abvr>
wemmick was again apostrophizing and you said you could write greek </s>
<s> 
yah bounceable </s>
<s>  what a liar you were </s>
<s>  i never met such a liar as you </s>
<s> 
 before putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the
largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only
the day before </s>
<s> 

while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair
the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
from like sources </s>
<s>  as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i
ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before
me dusting his hands </s>
<s> 

o yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind </s>
<s>  one brings
another you see </s>
<s>  thats the way of it </s>
<s>  i always take �em </s>
<s>  theyre
curiosities </s>
<s>  and theyre property </s>
<s>  they may not be worth much but
after all theyre property and portable </s>
<s>  it dont signify to you with
your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guidingstar always is
�get hold of portable property </s>
<s> 

when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a
friendly manner </s>
<s> 

if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldnt
mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i
should consider it an honor </s>
<s>  i have not much to show you </s>

fond of a bit of garden and a summerhouse </s>

to dine with <abvr> jaggers look at his housekeeper </s>

shall i see something very uncommon </s>
<s> 

well said wemmick youll see a wild beast tamed </s>
<s>  not so very
uncommon youll tell me </s>
<s>  i reply that depends on the original wildness
of the beast and the amount of taming </s>
<s>  it wont lower your opinion of
mr </s>

<s> 

i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened </s>
<s>  as i was taking my departure he asked me if i
would like to devote five minutes to seeing <abvr> jaggers at it </s>
<s> 

for several reasons and not least because i didnt clearly know what
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative </s>
<s> 
we dived into the city and came up in a crowded policecourt where
a bloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the

his finger </s>

side he was on i couldnt make out for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill </s>

he was not on the side of the bench </s>

chapter xxv

bentley drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book

acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit </s>
<s>  heavy in figure movement
and comprehensionin the sluggish complexion of his face and in
the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a roomhe was idle proud niggardly
reserved and suspicious </s>
<s>  he came of rich people down in somersetshire
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead </s>
<s>  thus bentley drummle
had come to <abvr> pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen </s>
<s> 

startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he
ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and
admired her beyond measure </s>
<s>  he had a womans delicacy of feature
and wasas you may see though you never saw her said herbert to
meexactly like his mother </s>
<s>  it was but natural that i should take to
him much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest
evenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one
another conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up
in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes </s>
<s>  he
would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature
even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way </s>
<s>  and i always
think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
midstream </s>
<s> 

herbert was my intimate companion and friend </s>
<s>  i presented him with a
halfshare in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down
to hammersmith </s>
<s>  and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often
took me up to london </s>
<s>  we used to walk between the two places at all
hours </s>
<s>  i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope </s>
<s> 

when i had been in <abvr> pockets family a month or two <abvr> and <abvr>
camilla turned up </s>
<s>  camilla was <abvr> pockets sister </s>
<s>  georgiana whom i
had seen at miss havishams on the same occasion also turned up </s>
<s>  she
was a cousinan indigestive single woman who called her rigidity
religion and her liver love </s>
<s>  these people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment </s>
<s>  as a matter of course they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness </s>
<s>  towards <abvr> pocket as
a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the
complacent forbearance i had heard them express </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket they
held in contempt </s>
<s>  but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves </s>
<s> 

these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied
myself to my education </s>
<s>  i soon contracted expensive habits and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have
thought almost fabulous </s>
<s>  but through good and evil i stuck to my books </s>
<s> 
there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies </s>
<s>  between <abvr> pocket and herbert i got on fast </s>
<s>  and with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and
clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as
drummle if i had done less </s>
<s> 

i had not seen <abvr> wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write
him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening </s>
<s>  he
replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect
me at the office at six oclock </s>
<s>  thither i went and there i found him
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck </s>
<s> 

did you think of walking down to walworth </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

certainly said i if you approve </s>
<s> 

very much was wemmicks reply for i have had my legs under the desk
all day and shall be glad to stretch them </s>
<s>  now ill tell you what i
have got for supper <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i have got a stewed steakwhich is
of home preparationand a cold roast fowlwhich is from the
cooksshop </s>
<s>  i think its tender because the master of the shop was a
juryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy </s>
<s> 
i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out
a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two we could easily have done it </s>
<s>  he said to that
let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop </s>
<s>  i let him of
course </s>
<s>  as far as it goes its property and portable </s>
<s>  you dont object
to an aged parent i hope </s>
<s> 

i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added
because i have got an aged parent at my place </s>
<s>  i then said what
politeness required </s>
<s> 

so you havent dined with <abvr> jaggers yet </s>
<s>  he pursued as we walked
along </s>
<s> 

not yet </s>
<s> 

he told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming </s>
<s>  i expect
youll have an invitation tomorrow </s>
<s>  hes going to ask your pals too </s>
<s> 
three of �em </s>
<s>  aint there </s>
<s> 

although i was not in the habit of counting drummle as one of my
intimate associates i answered yes </s>

well hes going to ask the whole gangi hardly felt complimented by
the wordand whatever he gives you hell give you good </s>
<s>  dont look
forward to variety but youll have excellence </s>
<s>  and theres another rum
thing in his house proceeded wemmick after a moments pause as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood </s>
<s>  he never lets a door
or window be fastened at night </s>
<s> 

is he never robbed </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  returned wemmick </s>
<s>  he says and gives it out publicly i
want to see the man wholl rob me </s>
<s>  lord bless you i have heard him a
hundred times if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our
front office you know where i live </s>
<s>  now no bolt is ever drawn there </s>
<s> 
why dont you do a stroke of business with me </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  cant i tempt you </s>
<s> 
 not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or
money </s>
<s> 

they dread him so much </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

dread him said wemmick </s>
<s>  i believe you they dread him </s>
<s>  not but what
hes artful even in his defiance of them </s>
<s>  no silver sir </s>
<s>  britannia
metal every spoon </s>
<s> 

so they wouldnt have much i observed even if they

ah </s>
<s>  but he would have much said wemmick cutting me short and they
know it </s>
<s>  hed have their lives and the lives of scores of �em </s>
<s>  hed
have all he could get </s>
<s>  and its impossible to say what he couldnt get
if he gave his mind to it </s>
<s> 

i was falling into meditation on my guardians greatness when wemmick
remarked </s>
<s> 

as to the absence of plate thats only his natural depth you know </s>
<s> 
a rivers its natural depth and hes his natural depth </s>
<s>  look at his
watchchain </s>
<s>  thats real enough </s>
<s> 

its very massive said i </s>
<s> 

massive </s>
<s>  repeated wemmick </s>
<s>  i think so </s>
<s>  and his watch is a gold
repeater and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch </s>
<s>  theres not a man a woman or a child among them who
wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it
was red hot if inveigled into touching it </s>
<s> 

at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature did <abvr> wemmick and i beguile the time and the road
until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
walworth </s>
<s> 

it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little
gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement </s>
<s> 
wemmicks house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns </s>
<s> 

my own doing said wemmick </s>
<s>  looks pretty </s>
<s>  dont it </s>
<s> 

i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw </s>
<s> 
with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at </s>
<s> 

thats a real flagstaff you see said wemmick and on sundays i
run up a real flag </s>
<s>  then look here </s>
<s>  after i have crossed this bridge i
hoist it upsoand cut off the communication </s>
<s> 

the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep </s>
<s>  but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he
hoisted it up and made it fast </s>
<s>  smiling as he did so with a relish and
not merely mechanically </s>
<s> 

at nine oclock every night greenwich time said wemmick the gun
fires </s>
<s>  there he is you see </s>
<s>  and when you hear him go i think youll
say hes a stinger </s>
<s> 

the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress
constructed of latticework </s>
<s>  it was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella </s>
<s> 

then at the back said wemmick out of sight so as not to impede
the idea of fortificationsfor its a principle with me if you have
an idea carry it out and keep it upi dont know whether thats your
opinion

i said decidedly </s>
<s> 

at the back theres a pig and there are fowls and rabbits </s>
<s>  then
i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers </s>
<s>  and
youll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise </s>
<s>  so sir said
wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you
can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions </s>
<s> 

then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at </s>
<s>  and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth </s>
<s> 
our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower
was raised </s>
<s>  this piece of water with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had
constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet </s>
<s> 

i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and
my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said wemmick in
acknowledging my compliments </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  its a good thing you know </s>
<s>  it
brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged </s>
<s>  you wouldnt
mind being at once introduced to the aged would you </s>
<s>  it wouldnt put
you out </s>
<s> 

i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle </s>
<s>  there
we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat </s>
<s>  clean
cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf </s>
<s> 

well aged parent said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial
and jocose way how am you </s>
<s> 

all right john </s>
<s>  all right </s>
<s>  replied the old man </s>
<s> 

heres <abvr> pip aged parent said wemmick and i wish you could hear
his name </s>
<s>  nod away at him <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  thats what he likes </s>
<s>  nod away at
him if you please like winking </s>
<s> 

this is a fine place of my sons sir cried the old man while i
nodded as hard as i possibly could </s>
<s>  this is a pretty pleasureground
sir </s>
<s>  this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the nation after my sons time for the peoples
enjoyment </s>
<s> 

youre as proud of it as punch </s>
<s>  aint you aged </s>
<s>  said wemmick
contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened </s>
<s>  theres
a nod for you </s>
<s>  giving him a tremendous one </s>
<s>  theres another for you </s>
<s> 
 giving him a still more tremendous one </s>
<s>  you like that dont you </s>
<s>  if
youre not tired <abvr> pipthough i know its tiring to strangerswill
you tip him one more </s>
<s>  you cant think how it pleases him </s>
<s> 

i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits </s>
<s>  we left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor </s>
<s>  where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken
him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection </s>
<s> 

is it your own <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

o yes said wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time </s>
<s>  its a
freehold by george </s>
<s> 

is it indeed </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> jaggers admires it </s>
<s> 

never seen it said wemmick </s>
<s>  never heard of it </s>
<s>  never seen the aged </s>
<s> 
never heard of him </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  the office is one thing and private life is
another </s>
<s>  when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and
when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me </s>
<s>  if its not
in any way disagreeable to you youll oblige me by doing the same </s>
<s>  i
dont wish it professionally spoken about </s>
<s> 

of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request </s>
<s>  the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and
talking until it was almost nine oclock </s>
<s>  getting near gunfire said
wemmick then as he laid down his pipe </s>
<s>  its the ageds treat </s>
<s> 

proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker
with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony </s>
<s>  wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the
moment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the aged and
repair to the battery </s>
<s>  he took it and went out and presently the
stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in
it ring </s>
<s>  upon this the agedwho i believe would have been blown out
of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly
hes fired </s>
<s>  i heerd him </s>
<s>  and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him </s>
<s> 

the interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing
me his collection of curiosities </s>
<s>  they were mostly of a felonious
character </s>
<s>  comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnationupon which <abvr>
wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one
of �em lies sir </s>
<s>  these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum and some tobaccostoppers carved by the aged </s>
<s>  they were all
displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first
inducted and which served not only as the general sittingroom but
as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roastingjack </s>
<s> 

there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in
the day </s>
<s>  when she had laid the suppercloth the bridge was lowered to
give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night </s>
<s>  the supper was
excellent </s>
<s>  and though the castle was rather subject to dryrot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been
farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment </s>
<s>  nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down
on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night </s>
<s> 

wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him
cleaning my boots </s>
<s>  after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from
my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in
a most devoted manner </s>
<s>  our breakfast was as good as the supper and at
halfpast eight precisely we started for little britain </s>
<s>  by degrees
wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened
into a postoffice again </s>
<s>  at last when we got to his place of business
and he pulled out his key from his coatcollar he looked as unconscious
of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the stinger </s>

chapter xxvi

it fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardians establishment with that of his
cashier and clerk </s>
<s>  my guardian was in his room washing his hands with
his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth </s>
<s>  and he
called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which wemmick had prepared me to receive </s>
<s>  no ceremony he stipulated
and no dinner dress and say tomorrow </s>
<s>  i asked him where we should
come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his
general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied
come here and ill take you home with me </s>
<s>  i embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or
a dentist </s>
<s>  he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumers shop </s>
<s>  it had an unusually
large jacktowel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his
hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room </s>
<s>  when i and
my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found
him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands
but laving his face and gargling his throat </s>
<s>  and even when he had
done all that and had gone all round the jacktowel he took out his
penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat
on </s>
<s> 

there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him </s>
<s>  but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his presence that they gave it up for that day </s>
<s>  as we walked along
westward he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me </s>
<s>  but
he never otherwise recognized anybody or took notice that anybody
recognized him </s>
<s> 

he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of
that street </s>
<s>  rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want
of painting and with dirty windows </s>
<s>  he took out his key and opened the
door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used </s>
<s> 
so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor </s>
<s>  there were carved garlands on the panelled walls and
as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i
thought they looked like </s>
<s> 

dinner was laid in the best of these rooms </s>
<s>  the second was his
dressingroom </s>
<s>  the third his bedroom </s>
<s>  he told us that he held the whole
house but rarely used more of it than we saw </s>
<s>  the table was comfortably
laidno silver in the service of courseand at the side of his chair
was a capacious dumbwaiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it and four dishes of fruit for dessert </s>
<s>  i noticed throughout that he
kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself </s>
<s> 

there was a bookcase in the room </s>
<s>  i saw from the backs of the books
that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials
acts of parliament and such things </s>
<s>  the furniture was all very solid
and good like his watchchain </s>
<s>  it had an official look however and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen </s>
<s>  in a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp </s>
<s>  so that he seemed to bring the
office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work </s>
<s> 

as he had scarcely seen my three companions until nowfor he and i had
walked togetherhe stood on the hearthrug after ringing the bell
and took a searching look at them </s>
<s>  to my surprise he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in drummle </s>
<s> 

pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window i dont know one from the other </s>
<s>  whos the spider </s>
<s> 

the spider </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow </s>
<s> 

thats bentley drummle i replied </s>
<s>  the one with the delicate face is
startop </s>
<s> 

not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he
returned bentley drummle is his name is it </s>
<s>  i like the look of that
fellow </s>
<s> 

he immediately began to talk to drummle </s>
<s>  not at all deterred by his
replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him </s>
<s>  i was looking at the two when there came between
me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table </s>
<s> 

she was a woman of about forty i supposedbut i may have thought her
younger than she was </s>
<s>  rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely
pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair </s>
<s>  i cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter </s>
<s>  but i know that i had been to see macbeth at
the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had seen rise out
of the witches caldron </s>
<s> 

she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished </s>
<s>  we took our seats
at the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him
while startop sat on the other </s>
<s>  it was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird </s>
<s>  sauces wines all
the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our
host from his dumbwaiter </s>
<s>  and when they had made the circuit of the
table he always put them back again </s>
<s>  similarly he dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair </s>
<s>  no other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared </s>
<s>  she set on every dish </s>
<s>  and i always saw
in her face a face rising out of the caldron </s>
<s>  years afterwards i made
a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room </s>
<s> 

induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her
own striking appearance and by wemmicks preparation i observed
that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and
wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say </s>
<s>  i
fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a
purpose of always holding her in suspense </s>
<s> 

dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us </s>
<s>  for myself i found that i was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronize herbert and to boast
of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips </s>
<s> 
it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle </s>
<s>  the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off </s>
<s> 

it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his </s>
<s> 
drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to
our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that
as to strength he could scatter us like chaff </s>
<s>  by some invisible agency
my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle </s>
<s>  and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular
it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner </s>
<s> 

now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table </s>
<s>  my guardian
taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her
was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
showing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable </s>
<s> 
suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeepers like a trap
as she stretched it across the table </s>
<s>  so suddenly and smartly did he do
this that we all stopped in our foolish contention </s>
<s> 

if you talk of strength said <abvr> jaggers ill show you a wrist </s>
<s> 
molly let them see your wrist </s>
<s> 

her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other
hand behind her waist </s>
<s>  master she said in a low voice with her eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him </s>
<s>  dont </s>
<s> 

ill show you a wrist repeated <abvr> jaggers with an immovable
determination to show it </s>
<s>  molly let them see your wrist </s>
<s> 

master she again murmured </s>
<s>  please </s>
<s> 

molly said <abvr> jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists </s>
<s>  show
them </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table </s>
<s>  she
brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by
side </s>
<s>  the last wrist was much disfigureddeeply scarred and scarred
across and across </s>
<s>  when she held her hands out she took her eyes from
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession </s>
<s> 

theres power here said <abvr> jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews
with his forefinger </s>
<s>  very few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has </s>
<s>  its remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands </s>
<s>  i have had occasion to notice many hands </s>
<s>  but i never saw
stronger in that respect mans or womans than these </s>
<s> 

while he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat </s>
<s>  the moment
he ceased she looked at him again </s>
<s>  thatll do molly said <abvr>
jaggers giving her a slight nod </s>
<s>  you have been admired and can
go </s>
<s>  she withdrew her hands and went out of the room and <abvr> jaggers
putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter filled his glass and
passed round the wine </s>
<s> 

at halfpast nine gentlemen said he we must break up </s>
<s>  pray make
the best use of your time </s>
<s>  i am glad to see you all </s>
<s>  <abvr> drummle i
drink to you </s>
<s> 

if his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more
it perfectly succeeded </s>
<s>  in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose
depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree
until he became downright intolerable </s>
<s>  through all his stages <abvr>
jaggers followed him with the same strange interest </s>
<s>  he actually seemed
to serve as a zest to <abvr> jaggerss wine </s>
<s> 

in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink
and i know we talked too much </s>
<s>  we became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of drummles to the effect that we were too free with our
money </s>
<s>  it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it
came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before </s>
<s> 

well retorted drummle </s>
<s>  hell be paid </s>
<s> 

i dont mean to imply that he wont said i but it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money i should think </s>
<s> 

you should think </s>
<s>  retorted drummle </s>
<s>  oh lord </s>
<s> 

i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldnt
lend money to any of us if we wanted it </s>
<s> 

you are right said drummle </s>
<s>  i wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence </s>
<s>  i
wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence </s>
<s> 

rather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should say </s>
<s> 

you should say repeated drummle </s>
<s>  oh lord </s>
<s> 

this was so very aggravatingthe more especially as i found myself
making no way against his surly obtusenessthat i said disregarding
herberts efforts to check me

come <abvr> drummle since we are on the subject ill tell you what
passed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that money </s>
<s> 

i dont want to know what passed between herbert there and you
 growled drummle </s>
<s>  and i think he added in a lower growl that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves </s>
<s> 

ill tell you however said i whether you want to know or not </s>
<s>  we
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed
to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it </s>
<s> 

drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands
in his pockets and his round shoulders raised </s>
<s>  plainly signifying that
it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all </s>
<s> 

hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than
i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable </s>
<s>  startop
being a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact
opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
personal affront </s>
<s>  he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh </s>
<s>  resenting this little success more than anything drummle
without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets
dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would
have flung it at his adversarys head but for our entertainers
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose </s>
<s> 

gentlemen said <abvr> jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and
hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly
sorry to announce that its half past nine </s>
<s> 

on this hint we all rose to depart </s>
<s>  before we got to the street door
startop was cheerily calling drummle old boy as if nothing had
happened </s>
<s>  but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not
even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way </s>
<s>  so herbert and i
who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides </s>
<s> 
startop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses
much as he was wont to follow in his boat </s>
<s> 

as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for
a moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian </s>
<s>  i found
him in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots already hard
at it washing his hands of us </s>
<s> 

i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame
me much </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said he sluicing his face and speaking through the
waterdrops </s>
<s>  its nothing pip </s>
<s>  i like that spider though </s>
<s> 

he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and
towelling himself </s>
<s> 

i am glad you like him sir said ibut i dont </s>
<s> 

no no my guardian assented </s>
<s>  dont have too much to do with him </s>
<s> 
keep as clear of him as you can </s>
<s>  but i like the fellow pip </s>
<s>  he is one
of the true sort </s>
<s>  why if i was a fortuneteller

looking out of the towel he caught my eye </s>
<s> 

but i am not a fortuneteller he said letting his head drop into a
festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears </s>
<s>  you know what i
am dont you </s>
<s>  good night pip </s>
<s> 

good night sir </s>
<s> 

in about a month after that the spiders time with <abvr> pocket was up
for good and to the great relief of all the house but <abvr> pocket he
went home to the family hole </s>

my dear mr pip </s>
<s> 

i write this by request of <abvr> gargery for to let you know that he
is going to london in company with <abvr> wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you </s>
<s>  he would call at barnards hotel
tuesday morning at nine oclock when if not agreeable please leave
word </s>
<s>  your poor sister is much the same as when you left </s>
<s>  we talk of you
in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing </s>
<s>  if
now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of
poor old days </s>
<s>  no more dear <abvr> pip from your ever obliged and
affectionate servant

biddy </s>
<s> 

p </s>
<s> s </s>
<s>  he wishes me most particular to write what larks </s>
<s>  he says you will
understand </s>
<s>  i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him
even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a
worthy worthy man </s>
<s>  i have read him all excepting only the last little
sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks </s>
<s> 

i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its
appointment was for next day </s>
<s>  let me confess exactly with what feelings
i looked forward to joes coming </s>
<s> 

not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of
incongruity </s>
<s>  if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly
would have paid money </s>
<s>  my greatest reassurance was that he was coming
to barnards inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall
in bentley drummles way </s>
<s>  i had little objection to his being seen by
herbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect </s>
<s>  but i had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in
contempt </s>
<s>  so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise </s>
<s> 

i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those
wrestles with barnard proved to be </s>
<s>  by this time the rooms were
vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer </s>
<s>  i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy
in bootstop bootsin bondage and slavery to whom i might have been
said to pass my days </s>
<s>  for after i had made the monster out of the
refuse of my washerwomans family and had clothed him with a blue
coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots
already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal
to eat </s>
<s>  and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my
existence </s>
<s> 

this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday
morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for
floorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought joe would like </s>
<s>  while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being
so interested and considerate i had an odd halfprovoked sense of
suspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he wouldnt
have been quite so brisk about it </s>
<s> 

however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and
i got up early in the morning and caused the sittingroom and
breakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance </s>
<s>  unfortunately
the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak
giant of a sweep </s>
<s> 

as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on
the staircase </s>
<s>  i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs
his state boots being always too big for himand by the time
it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his ascent </s>
<s>  when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards
distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole </s>
<s>  finally he gave a
faint single rap and peppersuch was the compromising name of the
avenging boyannounced <abvr> gargery </s>
<s>  i thought he never would have
done wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the
mat but at last he came in </s>
<s> 

joe how are you joe </s>
<s> 

pip how air you pip </s>
<s> 

with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put
down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down as if i had been the lastpatented pump </s>
<s> 

i am glad to see you joe </s>
<s>  give me your hat </s>
<s> 

but joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a birdsnest with
eggs in it wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way </s>
<s> 

which you have that growed said joe and that swelled and that
gentlefolked </s>
<s>  joe considered a little before he discovered this word </s>
<s> 
as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country </s>
<s> 

and you joe look wonderfully well </s>
<s> 

thank god said joe im ekerval to most </s>
<s>  and your sister shes
no worse than she were </s>
<s>  and biddy shes ever right and ready </s>
<s>  and all
friends is no backerder if not no forarder </s>
<s>  �ceptin wopsle </s>
<s>  hes had a
drop </s>
<s> 

all this time still with both hands taking great care of the
birdsnest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown </s>
<s> 

had a drop joe </s>
<s> 

why yes said joe lowering his voice hes left the church and went
into the playacting </s>
<s>  which the playacting have likeways brought him
to london along with me </s>
<s>  and his wish were said joe getting the
birdsnest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an
egg with his right </s>
<s>  if no offence as i would �and you that </s>
<s> 

i took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled playbill of
a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that
very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles </s>
<s> 

were you at his performance joe </s>
<s>  i inquired </s>
<s> 

i were said joe with emphasis and solemnity </s>
<s> 

was there a great sensation </s>
<s> 

why said joe yes there certainly were a peck of orangepeel </s>
<s> 
partickler when he see the ghost </s>
<s>  though i put it to yourself sir
whether it were calclated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with
amen </s>
<s>  a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said
joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but
that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time </s>
<s>  which i
meantersay if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to
claim his attention what can sir </s>
<s>  still more when his mourning �at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off try to keep it on how you may </s>
<s> 

a ghostseeing effect in joes own countenance informed me that herbert
had entered the room </s>
<s>  so i presented joe to herbert who held out his
hand </s>
<s>  but joe backed from it and held on by the birdsnest </s>
<s> 

your servant sir said joe which i hope as you and piphere his
eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family that i frowned it down and confused him morei meantersay you
two gentlemenwhich i hope as you get your elths in this close spot </s>
<s> 
for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions
 said joe confidentially and i believe its character do stand it </s>
<s>  but i
wouldnt keep a pig in it myselfnot in the case that i wished him to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him </s>
<s> 

having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwellingplace and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
sir joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hatas if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting placeand ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimneypiece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals </s>
<s> 

do you take tea or coffee <abvr> gargery </s>
<s>  asked herbert who always
presided of a morning </s>
<s> 

thankee sir said joe stiff from head to foot ill take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself </s>
<s> 

what do you say to coffee </s>
<s> 

thankee sir returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal
since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy
to your own opinions </s>
<s>  but dont you never find it a little �eating </s>
<s> 

say tea then said herbert pouring it out </s>
<s> 

here joes hat tumbled off the mantelpiece and he started out of his
chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot </s>
<s>  as if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon </s>
<s> 

when did you come to town <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

were it yesterday afternoon </s>
<s>  said joe after coughing behind his hand
as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came </s>
<s>  no
it were not </s>
<s>  yes it were </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  it were yesterday afternoon with an
appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality </s>
<s> 

have you seen anything of london yet </s>
<s> 

why yes sir said joe me and wopsle went off straight to look at
the blacking wareus </s>
<s>  but we didnt find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors </s>
<s>  which i meantersay added joe in
an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral </s>
<s> 

i really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but
for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which
was toppling </s>
<s>  indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a
quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicketkeeping </s>
<s> 
he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill </s>
<s>  now
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped </s>
<s>  now merely stopping
it midway beating it up and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall
before he felt it safe to close with it </s>
<s>  finally splashing it into the
slopbasin where i took the liberty of laying hands upon it </s>
<s> 

as to his shirtcollar and his coatcollar they were perplexing to
reflect uponinsoluble mysteries both </s>
<s>  why should a man scrape himself
to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed </s>
<s>  why
should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his holiday clothes </s>
<s>  then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth </s>
<s>  had
his eyes attracted in such strange directions </s>
<s>  was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs </s>
<s>  sat so far from the table and dropped so much
more than he ate and pretended that he hadnt dropped it </s>
<s>  that i was
heartily glad when herbert left us for the city </s>
<s> 

i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have
been easier with me </s>
<s>  i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him </s>
<s> 
in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head </s>
<s> 

us two being now alone sirbegan joe </s>
<s> 

joe i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir </s>
<s> 

joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach </s>
<s>  utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars
were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look </s>
<s> 

us two being now alone resumed joe and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now concludeleastways
beginto mention what have led to my having had the present honor </s>
<s>  for
was it not said joe with his old air of lucid exposition that my
only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen </s>

i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance
against this tone </s>

chapter xxviii

it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first
flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joes </s>
<s> 
but when i had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach and had been
down to <abvr> pockets and back i was not by any means convinced on the
last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the blue boar </s>
<s>  i should be an inconvenience at joes </s>
<s>  i was not
expected and my bed would not be ready </s>
<s>  i should be too far from
miss havishams and she was exacting and mightnt like it </s>
<s>  all other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers and with such
pretences did i cheat myself </s>
<s>  surely a curious thing </s>
<s>  that i should
innocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elses manufacture is
reasonable enough </s>
<s>  but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money </s>
<s>  an obliging stranger under pretence of
compactly folding up my banknotes for securitys sake abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells </s>
<s>  but what is his sleight of hand to mine
when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes </s>
<s> 

having settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger </s>
<s>  it was
tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots
in the archway of the blue boars postingyard </s>
<s>  it was almost solemn to
imagine him casually produced in the tailors shop and confounding
the disrespectful senses of trabbs boy </s>
<s>  on the other hand trabbs boy
might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things </s>
<s>  or reckless
and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high
street </s>
<s>  my patroness too might hear of him and not approve </s>
<s>  on the
whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind </s>
<s> 

it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter
had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark </s>
<s>  our time of starting from the cross keys was
two oclock </s>
<s>  i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare
attended by the avengerif i may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he could possibly help it </s>
<s> 

at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dockyards
by stagecoach </s>
<s>  as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised
when herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me </s>
<s>  but i had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict </s>
<s> 

you dont mind them handel </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s> 

o no </s>
<s> 

i thought you seemed as if you didnt like them </s>
<s> 

i cant pretend that i do like them and i suppose you dont
particularly </s>
<s>  but i dont mind them </s>
<s> 

see </s>
<s>  there they are said herbert coming out of the tap </s>
<s>  what a
degraded and vile sight it is </s>
<s> 

they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler
with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands </s>
<s> 
the two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their
legsirons of a pattern that i knew well </s>
<s>  they wore the dress that i
likewise knew well </s>
<s>  their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried
a thickknobbed bludgeon under his arm </s>
<s>  but he was on terms of good
understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at
the puttingto of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the
curator </s>
<s>  one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared
as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world
both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of
clothes </s>
<s>  his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes
and his attire disguised him absurdly </s>
<s>  but i knew his halfclosed eye
at one glance </s>
<s>  there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the
three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun </s>
<s> 

it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
never seen me in his life </s>
<s>  he looked across at me and his eye appraised
my watchchain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle and looked at something else </s>
<s>  the great
numbers on their backs as if they were street doors </s>
<s>  their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals </s>
<s>  their ironed
legs apologetically garlanded with pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s>  and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them </s>
<s>  made them as
herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle </s>
<s> 

but this was not the worst of it </s>
<s>  it came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman </s>
<s>  hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the
fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous
company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and
shameful and i dont know what else </s>
<s>  at this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and
the prisoners had come over with their keeperbringing with them that
curious flavor of breadpoultice baize ropeyarn and hearthstone
which attends the convict presence </s>
<s> 

dont take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger </s>
<s>  ill sit next you myself </s>
<s>  ill put �em on the outside of
the row </s>
<s>  they wont interfere with you sir </s>
<s>  you neednt know theyre
there </s>
<s> 

and dont blame me growled the convict i had recognized </s>
<s>  i dont
want to go </s>
<s>  i am quite ready to stay behind </s>
<s>  as fur as i am concerned
any ones welcome to my place </s>
<s> 

or mine said the other gruffly </s>
<s>  i wouldnt have incommoded none
of you if id had my way </s>
<s>  then they both laughed and began cracking
nuts and spitting the shells about </s>
<s> as i really think i should have
liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised </s>
<s> 

at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman
and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind </s>
<s>  so he
got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the
place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could and the convict i had recognized sat behind me with his breath on
the hair of my head </s>
<s> 

goodbye handel </s>
<s>  herbert called out as we started </s>
<s>  i thought what a
blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convicts
breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine </s>
<s>  the
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid it set my very teeth on edge </s>
<s>  he seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in
doing it </s>
<s>  and i was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him off </s>
<s> 

the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold </s>
<s>  it made us
all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the halfway
house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent </s>
<s>  i dozed
off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him
and how it could best be done </s>
<s>  in the act of dipping forward as if i
were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the
question up again </s>
<s> 

but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although
i could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us </s>
<s>  cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind the convicts were closer to me than before </s>
<s>  the very first
words i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of
my own thought two one pound notes </s>
<s> 

how did he get �em </s>
<s>  said the convict i had never seen </s>
<s> 

how should i know </s>

<s>  he had �em stowed away

<s>  id sell all the friends i ever had for one and
think it a blessed good bargain </s>

<s> 

so he says resumed the convict i had recognizedit was all
said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the
dockyard�youre a going to be discharged </s>

<s>  would i find
out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two
one pound notes </s>

<s>  mudbank mist swamp and work </s>
<s>  work swamp
mist and mudbank </s>
<s> 

they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually
growled themselves out and had nothing left to say </s>
<s> 

after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity </s>
<s>  indeed i was not
only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could
have known me without accidental help </s>
<s>  still the coincidence of our
being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his
hearing with my name </s>
<s>  for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing </s>
<s>  this device i
executed successfully </s>
<s>  my little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet </s>
<s>  i had but to turn a hinge to get it out </s>
<s>  i threw it down before
me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement </s>
<s>  as to the convicts they went their way
with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off to
the river </s>

them at the slimewashed stairsagain heard the gruff give way you </s>
<s> 
 like and order to dogsagain saw the wicked noahs ark lying out on
the black water </s>
<s> 

i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me </s>
<s>  as i walked on to
the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble </s>
<s>  i am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood </s>
<s> 

the coffeeroom at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered
my dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me </s>

soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory he asked me
if he should send boots for <abvr> pumblechook </s>

no said i certainly not </s>
<s> 

the waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from the
commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and
took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
newspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this
paragraph </s>
<s> 

our readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference to
the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this
neighborhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our as yet
not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our columns </s>
<s> 
that the youths earliest patron companion and friend was a highly
respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises
are situate within a hundred miles of the high street </s>
<s>  it is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as the mentor
of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our town produced

i entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the
days of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met
somebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have
told me that pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
fortunes </s>

chapter xxix

betimes in the morning i was up and out </s>

miss havishams so i loitered into the country on miss havishams
side of townwhich was not joes side </s>

she had adopted estella she had as good as adopted me and it could not
fail to be her intention to bring us together </s>

restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark rooms

cobwebs destroy the verminin short do all the shining deeds of the
young knight of romance and marry the princess </s>
<s>  i had stopped to
look at the house as i passed </s>
<s>  and its seared red brick walls blocked
windows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich
attractive mystery of which i was the hero </s>
<s>  estella was the inspiration
of it and the heart of it of course </s>
<s>  but though she had taken such
strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been
allpowerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any
attributes save those she possessed </s>
<s>  i mention this in this place of a
fixed purpose because it is the clew by which i am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth </s>
<s>  according to my experience the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true </s>
<s>  the unqualified truth is that when i
loved estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found
her irresistible </s>
<s>  once for all </s>
<s>  i knew to my sorrow often and often
if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against
peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that
could be </s>
<s>  once for all </s>
<s>  i loved her none the less because i knew it
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly
believed her to be human perfection </s>
<s> 

i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time </s>
<s>  when
i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the
gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet </s>
<s>  i heard the sidedoor open and steps come across the
courtyard </s>
<s>  but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges </s>
<s> 

being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned </s>
<s>  i started
much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress </s>
<s>  the last man i should have expected to see in that place of
porter at miss havishams door </s>
<s> 

orlick </s>
<s> 

ah young master theres more changes than yours </s>
<s>  but come in come
in </s>
<s>  its opposed to my orders to hold the gate open </s>
<s> 

i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> 
 said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house </s>
<s>  here i am </s>
<s> 

how did you come here </s>
<s> 

i come her he retorted on my legs </s>
<s>  i had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow </s>
<s> 

are you here for good </s>
<s> 

i aint here for harm young master i suppose </s>
<s> 

i was not so sure of that </s>
<s>  i had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my
legs and arms to my face </s>
<s> 

then you have left the forge </s>
<s>  i said </s>
<s> 

do this look like a forge </s>
<s>  replied orlick sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury </s>
<s>  now do it look like it </s>
<s> 

i asked him how long he had left gargerys forge </s>

one day is so like another here he replied that i dont know
without casting it up </s>

<s> 

i could have told you that orlick </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said he dryly </s>
<s>  but then youve got to be a scholar </s>
<s> 

by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one
just within the sidedoor with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard </s>
<s>  in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gateporter in paris </s>
<s>  certain keys were hanging on
the wall to which he now added the gate key </s>
<s>  and his patchworkcovered
bed was in a little inner division or recess </s>
<s>  the whole had a slovenly
confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse </s>
<s>  while he
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted upas indeed he was </s>
<s> 

i never saw this room before i remarked </s>
<s>  but there used to be no
porter here </s>
<s> 

no said he </s>
<s>  not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and
tag and rag and bobtail going up and down </s>
<s>  and then i was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and
i took it </s>
<s>  its easier than bellowsing and hammering </s>
<s> thats loaded
that is </s>
<s> 

my eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the
chimneypiece and his eye had followed mine </s>
<s> 

well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to

shaking himself </s>

you meet somebody </s>

i am expected i believe </s>

burn me twice over if i can say </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in
my thick boots and he made his bell sound </s>
<s>  at the end of the passage
while the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me </s>

it is miss pocket </s>

had better be wiser than well </s>
<s>  ah matthew matthew </s>
<s>  you know your way
sir </s>
<s> 

tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time </s>
<s>  i
ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old
way at the door of miss havishams room </s>
<s>  pips rap i heard her say
immediately </s>
<s>  come in pip </s>
<s> 

she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two
hands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on
the fire </s>
<s>  sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been
worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant
lady whom i had never seen </s>
<s> 

come in pip miss havisham continued to mutter without looking round
or up </s>
<s>  come in pip how do you do pip </s>
<s>  so you kiss my hand as if i
were a queen eh </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> 

she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a
grimly playful manner

well </s>
<s> 

i heard miss havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s> 

the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked
archly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estellas eyes </s>
<s>  but she
was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly
in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance
that i seemed to have made none </s>
<s>  i fancied as i looked at her that
i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again </s>
<s>  o
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the
inaccessibility that came about her </s>
<s> 

she gave me her hand </s>
<s>  i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in
seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long
long time </s>
<s> 

do you find her much changed pip </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham with her
greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between
them as a sign to me to sit down there </s>

when i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella
in the face or figure </s>
<s>  but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old

what </s>
<s>  you are not going to say into the old estella </s>
<s>  miss havisham
interrupted </s>
<s>  she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away
from her </s>
<s>  dont you remember </s>

i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better
then and the like </s>

had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

is he changed </s>

<s> 

very much said estella looking at me </s>
<s> 

less coarse and common </s>
<s>  said miss havisham playing with estellas
hair </s>
<s> 

estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again
and looked at me and put the shoe down </s>
<s>  she treated me as a boy still
but she lured me on </s>
<s> 

we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from
france and that she was going to london </s>
<s>  proud and wilful as of old
she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that
it was impossible and out of natureor i thought soto separate them
from her beauty </s>
<s>  truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhoodfrom all those illregulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and joefrom all those visions that had
raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the
anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge and flit away </s>
<s>  in a word it was impossible for me
to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life

it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and
return to the hotel at night and to london tomorrow </s>
<s>  when we had
conversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden </s>

her about a little as in times of yore </s>

i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress </s>

quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine </s>

<s>  she replied in an incidental and forgetful way </s>
<s>  i remember i
entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill
that he should be brought here to pester me with his company </s>
<s> 

he and i are great friends now </s>
<s> 

are you </s>
<s>  i think i recollect though that you read with his father </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish
look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy </s>
<s> 

since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your
companions said estella </s>
<s> 

naturally said i </s>
<s> 

and necessarily she added in a haughty tone </s>
<s>  what was fit company
for you once would be quite unfit company for you now </s>
<s> 

in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering
intention left of going to see joe </s>
<s>  but if i had this observation put
it to flight </s>
<s> 

you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those times </s>
<s>  said
estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting
times </s>
<s> 

not the least </s>
<s> 

the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my
side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at
hers made a contrast that i strongly felt </s>
<s>  it would have rankled in me
more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her and assigned to her </s>
<s> 

the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again
into the brewery yard </s>
<s>  i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her
walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and
careless look in that direction did i </s>
<s>  i reminded her where she had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i
dont remember </s>
<s>  not remember that you made me cry </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  no said
she and shook her head and looked about her </s>
<s>  i verily believe that
her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again
inwardlyand that is the sharpest crying of all </s>
<s> 

you must know said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might that i have no heartif that has anything to
do with my memory </s>
<s> 

i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of
doubting that </s>
<s>  that i knew better </s>
<s>  that there could be no such beauty
without it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubt said
estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease
to be </s>
<s>  but you know what i mean </s>
<s>  i have no softness there
nosympathysentimentnonsense </s>
<s> 

what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and
looked attentively at me </s>
<s>  anything that i had seen in miss havisham </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different </s>
<s>  and yet i could not trace this to miss havisham </s>
<s>  i looked
again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone </s>
<s> 

what was it </s>
<s> 

i am serious said estella not so much with a frown for her brow was
smooth as with a darkening of her face </s>
<s>  if we are to be thrown much
together you had better believe it at once </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  imperiously stopping
me as i opened my lips </s>
<s>  i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere </s>
<s>  i
have never had any such thing </s>
<s> 

in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she
pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same
first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have
seen me standing scared below </s>
<s>  as my eyes followed her white hand again
the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me </s>
<s>  my
involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm </s>
<s>  instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone </s>
<s> 

what was it </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  asked estella </s>
<s>  are you scared again </s>
<s> 

i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn
it off </s>
<s> 

then you dont </s>
<s>  very well </s>
<s>  it is said at any rate </s>
<s>  miss havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be
laid aside now with other old belongings </s>
<s>  let us make one more round
of the garden and then go in </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  you shall not shed tears for my
cruelty today </s>
<s>  you shall be my page and give me your shoulder </s>
<s> 

her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground </s>
<s>  she held it in one hand
now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked </s>
<s>  we
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in
bloom for me </s>
<s>  if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance </s>
<s> 

there was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me </s>
<s> 
we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more
in her case than in mine </s>
<s>  but the air of inaccessibility which her
beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight
and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another </s>
<s>  wretched boy </s>
<s> 

at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise
that my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and
would come back to dinner </s>
<s>  the old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me </s>
<s> 

it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast </s>
<s>  but
in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before and i was under stronger enchantment </s>
<s> 

the time so melted away that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand
and estella left us to prepare herself </s>
<s>  we had stopped near the centre
of the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth </s>
<s>  as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful </s>
<s> 

then estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and
said in a whisper

is she beautiful graceful wellgrown </s>
<s>  do you admire her </s>
<s> 

everybody must who sees her miss havisham </s>
<s> 

she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as
she sat in the chair </s>
<s>  love her love her love her </s>
<s>  how does she use
you </s>
<s> 

before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question
at all she repeated love her love her love her </s>
<s>  if she favors
you love her </s>
<s>  if she wounds you love her </s>
<s>  if she tears your heart to
piecesand as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeperlove
her love her love her </s>
<s> 

never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words </s>
<s>  i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her </s>
<s> 

hear me pip </s>
<s>  i adopted her to be loved </s>
<s>  i bred her and educated her
to be loved </s>
<s>  i developed her into what she is that she might be loved </s>
<s> 
love her </s>
<s> 

she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she
meant to say it </s>
<s>  but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her
lips more like a curse </s>
<s> 

ill tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what
real love is </s>
<s>  it is blind devotion unquestioning selfhumiliation
utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras i
did </s>
<s> 

when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught
her round the waist </s>
<s>  for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a
dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead </s>
<s> 

all this passed in a few seconds </s>
<s>  as i drew her down into her chair i
was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in
the room </s>
<s> 

he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a
pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was
of great value to him in his profession </s>
<s>  i have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief
as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing
as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself that the selfcommittal has followed
directly quite as a matter of course </s>
<s>  when i saw him in the room he had
this expressive pockethandkerchief in both hands and was looking at
us </s>
<s>  on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude indeed </s>
<s>  singular </s>
<s>  and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect </s>
<s> 

miss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody
else afraid of him </s>
<s>  she made a strong attempt to compose herself and
stammered that he was as punctual as ever </s>
<s> 

as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us </s>
<s>  how do you do
pip </s>
<s>  shall i give you a ride miss havisham </s>
<s>  once round </s>
<s>  and so you are
here pip </s>
<s> 

i told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to
come and see estella </s>
<s>  to which he replied ah </s>
<s>  very fine young lady </s>
<s> 
 then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his
large hands and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets </s>
<s> 

well pip </s>
<s>  how often have you seen miss estella before </s>
<s>  said he when
he came to a stop </s>
<s> 

how often </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  how many times </s>
<s>  ten thousand times </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly not so many </s>
<s> 

twice </s>
<s> 

jaggers interposed miss havisham much to my relief leave my pip
alone and go with him to your dinner </s>
<s> 

he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together </s>
<s>  while
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat
and drink </s>
<s>  offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred
times and once </s>
<s> 

i considered and said never </s>
<s> 

and never will pip he retorted with a frowning smile </s>
<s>  she has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this
present life of hers </s>
<s>  she wanders about in the night and then lays
hands on such food as she takes </s>
<s> 

pray sir said i may i ask you a question </s>
<s> 

you may said he and i may decline to answer it </s>
<s>  put your question </s>
<s> 

estellas name </s>
<s>  is it havisham or </s>
<s>  i had nothing to add </s>
<s> 

or what </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

is it havisham </s>
<s> 

it is havisham </s>
<s> 

this brought us to the dinnertable where she and sarah pocket awaited
us </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my
green and yellow friend </s>
<s>  we dined very well and were waited on by a
maidservant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but
who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole
time </s>
<s>  after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the
two ladies left us </s>
<s> 

anything to equal the determined reticence of <abvr> jaggers under that
roof i never saw elsewhere even in him </s>
<s>  he kept his very looks to
himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estellas face once during
dinner </s>
<s>  when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered
but never looked at her that i could see </s>
<s>  on the other hand she often
looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his
face never showed the least consciousness </s>
<s>  throughout dinner he took
a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations </s>
<s>  but here
again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he
extortedand even did extort though i dont know howthose references
out of my innocent self </s>
<s> 

and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him
of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that
really was too much for me </s>
<s>  he crossexamined his very wine when he had
nothing else in hand </s>
<s>  he held it between himself and the candle tasted
the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his
glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and
crossexamined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known
the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage </s>
<s>  three or four
times i feebly thought i would start conversation </s>
<s>  but whenever he saw
me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his
hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use for he couldnt answer </s>
<s> 

i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her
in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her
capwhich was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mopand
strewing the ground with her hairwhich assuredly had never grown
on her head </s>
<s>  she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss
havishams room and we four played at whist </s>
<s>  in the interval miss
havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her dressingtable into estellas hair and about her bosom and
arms </s>
<s>  and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick
eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it </s>
<s> 

of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the
glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing </s>
<s>  nor of
the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long
ago </s>
<s>  what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold
presence and my feelings towards estella </s>
<s>  it was not that i knew i could
never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to
hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see
him wash his hands of her </s>
<s>  it was that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of himit was that my feelings should be in the same
place with himthat was the agonizing circumstance </s>
<s> 

we played until nine oclock and then it was arranged that when estella
came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her
at the coach </s>

her </s>
<s> 

my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine </s>

night miss havishams words love her love her love her </s>

my ears </s>

chapter xxx

after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar
in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlicks
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havishams </s>
<s> 
why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man </s>
<s>  it seemed
quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a
satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick </s>
<s>  very
good pip he observed when i had concluded ill go round presently
and pay our friend off </s>
<s>  rather alarmed by this summary action i was
for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with </s>
<s>  oh no he wont said my guardian making his
pockethandkerchiefpoint with perfect confidence </s>
<s>  i should like to
see him argue the question with me </s>
<s> 

as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i
breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold
my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and
that i would go on along the london road while <abvr> jaggers was occupied
if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when
overtaken </s>
<s>  i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately
after breakfast </s>
<s>  by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of pumblechooks premises i got round into
the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in
comparative security </s>
<s> 

it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after </s>
<s> 
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they
had forgotten something and pass me face to faceon which occasions i
dont know whether they or i made the worse pretence </s>
<s>  they of not doing
it or i of not seeing it </s>
<s>  still my position was a distinguished one
and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant trabbs boy </s>
<s> 

casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i
beheld trabbs boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag </s>
<s> 
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced
with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating
myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabbs boy smote
together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in
every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace
hold me </s>
<s>  im so frightened </s>
<s>  feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance </s>
<s>  as i passed him
his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme
humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust </s>
<s> 

this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing </s>
<s>  i had not advanced
another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement
and indignation i again beheld trabbs boy approaching </s>
<s>  he was coming
round a narrow corner </s>
<s>  his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest
industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabbs with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait </s>
<s>  with a shock he became
aware of me and was severely visited as before </s>
<s>  but this time his
motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy </s>
<s>  his
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators
and i felt utterly confounded </s>
<s> 

i had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice when i
again beheld trabbs boy shooting round by a back way </s>
<s>  this time he was
entirely changed </s>
<s>  he wore the blue bag in the manner of my greatcoat
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he
from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand dont know yah </s>
<s> 
 words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by trabbs boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his
shirtcollar twined his sidehair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked
extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his
attendants dont know yah dont know yah �pon my soul dont know
yah </s>
<s>  the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith
culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to
speak ejected by it into the open country </s>
<s> 

but unless i had taken the life of trabbs boy on that occasion i
really do not even now see what i could have done save endure </s>
<s>  to
have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his hearts best blood would have been
futile and degrading </s>
<s>  moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt </s>
<s>  an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew
out again between his captors legs scornfully yelping </s>
<s>  i wrote
however to <abvr> trabb by next days post to say that <abvr> pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to
the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing
in every respectable mind </s>
<s> 

the coach with <abvr> jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my
boxseat again and arrived in london safebut not sound for my heart
was gone </s>
<s>  as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then
went on to barnards inn </s>
<s> 

i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back </s>
<s> 
having despatched the avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to the
dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum </s>
<s>  as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the
hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole i sent him to the play </s>
<s>  a better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than
the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him
employment </s>
<s>  so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park
corner to see what oclock it was </s>
<s> 

dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to
herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell
you </s>
<s> 

my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your
confidence </s>
<s> 

it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person </s>
<s> 

herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side
and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i
didnt go on </s>

herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i lovei
adoreestella </s>

instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matterofcourse
way exactly </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 

well herbert </s>
<s>  is that all you say </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 

what next i mean </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  of course i know that </s>

how do you know it </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

how do i know it handel </s>
<s>  why from you </s>
<s> 

i never told you </s>
<s> 

told me </s>
<s>  you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i
have had senses to perceive it </s>
<s>  you have always adored her ever since
i have known you </s>
<s>  you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together </s>
<s>  told me </s>
<s>  why you have always told me all day long </s>
<s>  when you
told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her
the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed </s>
<s> 

very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light i have never left off adoring her </s>
<s>  and she has come back a most
beautiful and most elegant creature </s>
<s>  and i saw her yesterday </s>
<s>  and if i
adored her before i now doubly adore her </s>
<s> 

lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for
her and allotted to her </s>
<s>  without encroaching on forbidden ground we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact </s>
<s>  have you any idea yet of estellas views on the adoration
question </s>
<s> 

i shook my head gloomily </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she is thousands of miles away from me
 said i </s>
<s> 

patience my dear handel </s>
<s>  time enough time enough </s>
<s>  but you have
something more to say </s>
<s> 

i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet its no worse to say it
than to think it </s>
<s>  you call me a lucky fellow </s>
<s>  of course i am </s>
<s>  i was a
blacksmiths boy but yesterday </s>
<s>  i amwhat shall i say i amtoday </s>
<s> 

say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling
and clapping his hand on the back of minea good fellow with
impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and
dreaming curiously mixed in him </s>
<s> 

i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character </s>
<s>  on the whole i by no means recognized the analysis
but thought it not worth disputing </s>
<s> 

when i ask what i am to call myself today herbert i went on i
suggest what i have in my thoughts </s>
<s>  you say i am lucky </s>
<s>  i know i have
done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised
me </s>
<s>  that is being very lucky </s>
<s>  and yet when i think of estella

and when dont you you know </s>
<s>  herbert threw in with his eyes on the
fire </s>
<s>  which i thought kind and sympathetic of him </s>
<s> 

then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances </s>
<s>  avoiding forbidden
ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of
one person naming no person all my expectations depend </s>
<s>  and at the
best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what
they are </s>
<s>  in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been
there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday </s>
<s> 

now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our
gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass </s>
<s>  likewise it seems to me
that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal </s>
<s>  didnt you tell me that
your guardian <abvr> jaggers told you in the beginning that you were
not endowed with expectations only </s>
<s>  and even if he had not told you
sothough that is a very large if i grantcould you believe that of
all men in london <abvr> jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
towards you unless he were sure of his ground </s>
<s> 

i said i could not deny that this was a strong point </s>
<s>  i said it people
often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice </s>
<s> as if i wanted to deny it </s>
<s> 

i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger </s>
<s>  as to the rest you
must bide your guardians time and he must bide his clients time </s>
<s> 
youll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are and then perhaps
youll get some further enlightenment </s>
<s>  at all events youll be nearer
getting it for it must come at last </s>
<s> 

what a hopeful disposition you have </s>
<s>  said i gratefully admiring his
cheery ways </s>
<s> 

i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else </s>
<s>  i must
acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is
not my own but my fathers </s>
<s>  the only remark i ever heard him make on
your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or <abvr>
jaggers would not be in it </s>
<s>  and now before i say anything more about my
father or my fathers son and repay confidence with confidence i want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a momentpositively
repulsive </s>

i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh

me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly
rising and when i laid my hand upon the village fingerpost smote upon
my heart again </s>

serious </s>

so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs

yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting
theme that she is rather below my mothers nonsensical family notions </s>

her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships </s>

as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to

this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play </s>

chapter xxxi

on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country
elevated in two armchairs on a kitchentable holding a court </s>
<s>  the
whole of the danish nobility were in attendance </s>
<s>  consisting of a noble
boy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life
and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance </s>
<s>  my gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished
that his curls and forehead had been more probable </s>
<s> 

several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded </s>
<s> 
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him
to the tomb and to have brought it back </s>
<s>  the royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality </s>
<s>  it was this i conceive which led to the shades being
advised by the gallery to turn over </s>
<s> a recommendation which it took
extremely ill </s>
<s>  it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall </s>
<s>  this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively </s>
<s> 
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically
brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her </s>
<s> 
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as
if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another
and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned
as the kettledrum </s>
<s>  the noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able
seaman a strolling actor a gravedigger a clergyman and a person
of the utmost importance at a court fencingmatch on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged </s>
<s>  this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and evenon
his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral
serviceto the general indignation taking the form of nuts </s>
<s>  lastly
ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of
time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried
it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the babys put
to bed lets have supper </s>
<s>  which to say the least of it was out of
keeping </s>
<s> 

upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect </s>
<s>  whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt the public helped him out with it </s>
<s>  as for example </s>
<s>  on the
question whether �twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes
and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for
it </s>
<s>  and quite a debating society arose </s>
<s>  when he asked what should such
fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged
with loud cries of hear hear </s>
<s>  when he appeared with his stocking
disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat
fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his
leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him </s>
<s> 
on his taking the recordersvery like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the doorhe was
called upon unanimously for rule britannia </s>
<s>  when he recommended the
player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and dont you do
it neither </s>
<s>  youre a deal worse than him </s>
<s>  and i grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted <abvr> wopsle on every one of these occasions </s>
<s> 

but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance
of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical washhouse
on one side and a turnpike gate on the other </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out </s>
<s>  heres the
undertaker a coming to see how youre a getting on with your work </s>
<s> 
 i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that <abvr> wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it
without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast </s>
<s> 
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment waiter </s>
<s>  the arrival of the body for interment in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general
joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of
an individual obnoxious to identification </s>
<s>  the joy attended <abvr> wopsle
through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchentable and had died by inches from the ankles upward </s>
<s> 

we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in </s>
<s>  therefore we had sat
feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear </s>
<s>  i
laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll </s>
<s> 
and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in <abvr> wopsles elocutionnot for old associations sake i am
afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and
downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything </s>
<s> 
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said
to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him </s>
<s> 

we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough
either </s>
<s>  standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we
came up with him

mr </s>
<s>  pip and friend </s>
<s> 

identity of <abvr> pip and friend confessed </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honor </s>
<s> 

waldengarver </s>
<s>  i repeatedwhen herbert murmured in my ear probably
wopsle </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  shall we follow you </s>
<s> 

a few steps please </s>
<s>  when we were in a side alley he turned and
asked how did you think he looked </s>
<s> i dressed him </s>
<s> 

i dont know what he had looked like except a funeral </s>
<s>  with the
addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary fire office </s>
<s>  but i said he had looked very nice </s>
<s> 

when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak
beautiful </s>
<s>  but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he
see the ghost in the queens apartment he might have made more of his
stockings </s>
<s> 

i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door
into a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it </s>
<s>  here <abvr> wopsle
was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just
room for us to look at him over one anothers shoulders by keeping the
packingcase door or lid wide open </s>
<s> 

gentlemen said <abvr> wopsle i am proud to see you </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> pip
you will excuse my sending round </s>
<s>  i had the happiness to know you in
former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged on the noble and the affluent </s>
<s> 

meanwhile <abvr> waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to
get himself out of his princely sables </s>
<s> 

skin the stockings off <abvr> waldengarver said the owner of that
property or youll bust �em </s>
<s>  bust �em and youll bust fiveandthirty
shillings </s>
<s>  shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair </s>
<s>  keep
quiet in your chair now and leave �em to me </s>
<s> 

with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim </s>
<s>  who on
the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward
with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow </s>
<s> 

i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play </s>
<s>  but then <abvr>
waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said

gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front </s>
<s> 

herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally </s>
<s>  so i
said capitally </s>
<s> 

how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage </s>
<s> 

herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete </s>
<s>  so i
said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it
massive and concrete </s>
<s> 

i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said <abvr> waldengarver
with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at
the time and holding on by the seat of the chair </s>
<s> 

but ill tell you one thing <abvr> waldengarver said the man who was on
his knees in which youre out in your reading </s>
<s>  now mind </s>
<s>  i dont care
who says contrairy </s>
<s>  i tell you so </s>
<s>  youre out in your reading of hamlet
when you get your legs in profile </s>
<s>  the last hamlet as i dressed made
the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a
large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which
was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever
his reading brought him into profile i called out i dont see no
wafers </s>
<s>  and at night his reading was lovely </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful
dependenti overlook his folly </s>
<s>  and then said aloud my view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here </s>
<s>  but they will improve they
will improve </s>
<s> 

herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve </s>
<s> 

did you observe gentlemen said <abvr> waldengarver that there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the servicei
mean the representation </s>
<s> 

we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man </s>
<s>  i
added he was drunk no doubt </s>
<s> 

o dear no sir said <abvr> wopsle not drunk </s>
<s>  his employer would see to
that sir </s>
<s>  his employer would not allow him to be drunk </s>
<s> 

you know his employer </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again </s>
<s>  performing both
ceremonies very slowly </s>
<s>  you must have observed gentlemen said he
an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance
expressive of low malignity who went throughi will not say
sustainedthe rôle if i may use a french expression of claudius king
of denmark </s>
<s>  that is his employer gentlemen </s>
<s>  such is the profession </s>
<s> 

without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for <abvr>
wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was
that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces
put onwhich jostled us out at the doorwayto ask herbert what he
thought of having him home to supper </s>
<s>  herbert said he thought it would
be kind to do so </s>
<s>  therefore i invited him and he went to barnards
with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat
until two oclock in the morning reviewing his success and developing
his plans </s>
<s>  i forget in detail what they were but i have a general
recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end
with crushing it </s>
<s>  inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope </s>
<s> 

miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i
had to give my hand in marriage to herberts clara or play hamlet to
miss havishams ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing
twenty words of it </s>

chapter xxxii

one day when i was busy with my books and <abvr> pocket i received a note
by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter </s>
<s> 
for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed
i divined whose hand it was </s>
<s>  it had no set beginning as dear <abvr> pip
or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus </s>
<s> 

i am to come to london the day after tomorrow by the midday coach </s>
<s>  i
believe it was settled you should meet me </s>
<s>  at all events miss havisham
has that impression and i write in obedience to it </s>
<s>  she sends you her
regard </s>
<s> 

yours estella </s>
<s> 

if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion </s>
<s>  but as there was not i was fain to be
content with those i had </s>
<s>  my appetite vanished instantly and i knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived </s>
<s>  not that its arrival brought
me either </s>
<s>  for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the
coachoffice in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the
blue boar in our town </s>
<s>  for all that i knew this perfectly well i still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time </s>
<s>  and in this condition of unreason i
had performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours when
wemmick ran against me </s>
<s> 

halloa <abvr> pip said he </s>
<s>  how do you do </s>
<s>  i should hardly have thought
this was your beat </s>
<s> 

i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged </s>
<s> 

both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged </s>
<s> 
hes in wonderful feather </s>
<s>  hell be eightytwo next birthday </s>
<s>  i have
a notion of firing eightytwo times if the neighborhood shouldnt
complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure </s>
<s> 
however this is not london talk </s>
<s>  where do you think i am going to </s>
<s> 

to the office </s>
<s>  said i for he was tending in that direction </s>
<s> 

next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate </s>
<s>  we are in
a bankersparcel case just at present and i have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client </s>
<s> 

did your client commit the robbery </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily </s>
<s>  but he
is accused of it </s>
<s>  so might you or i be </s>
<s>  either of us might be accused of
it you know </s>
<s> 

only neither of us is i remarked </s>
<s> 

yah </s>
<s>  said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger </s>
<s> 
youre a deep one <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  would you like to have a look at newgate </s>
<s> 
have you time to spare </s>
<s> 

i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coachoffice </s>
<s>  muttering that i would make the inquiry whether
i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his
temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expectedwhich
i knew beforehand quite as well as he </s>
<s>  i then rejoined <abvr> wemmick and
affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i
had received accepted his offer </s>
<s> 

we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules into the interior of the jail </s>
<s>  at that time jails were much
neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoingand which is always its heaviest and longest
punishmentwas still far off </s>
<s>  so felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup </s>
<s> 
it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his
rounds with beer </s>
<s>  and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying
beer and talking to friends </s>
<s>  and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing
scene it was </s>
<s> 

it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his plants </s>
<s>  this was first put into my head by his
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain
tom </s>
<s>  are you there </s>
<s>  ah indeed </s>
<s>  and also is that black bill behind
the cistern </s>
<s>  why i didnt look for you these two months </s>
<s>  how do you find
yourself </s>
<s>  equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperersalways singlywemmick with his postoffice in
an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last
observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial </s>
<s> 

he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department
of <abvr> jaggerss business </s>
<s>  though something of the state of <abvr> jaggers
hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits </s>
<s>  his
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod
and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both
hands and then tightening the postoffice and putting his hands in his
pockets </s>
<s>  in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees and then <abvr> wemmick backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced said its no use my boy </s>
<s>  im only
a subordinate </s>
<s>  i cant take it </s>
<s>  dont go on in that way with a
subordinate </s>
<s>  if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had
better address yourself to a principal </s>
<s>  there are plenty of principals
in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may
be worth the while of another </s>
<s>  thats my recommendation to you speaking
as a subordinate </s>
<s>  dont try on useless measures </s>
<s>  why should you </s>
<s>  now
whos next </s>
<s> 

thus we walked through wemmicks greenhouse until he turned to me and
said notice the man i shall shake hands with </s>
<s>  i should have done so
without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet </s>
<s> 

almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can
see now as i write in a wellworn olivecolored frockcoat with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that
went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner
of the bars and put his hand to his hatwhich had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold brothwith a halfserious and halfjocose military
salute </s>
<s> 

colonel to you </s>

all right <abvr> wemmick </s>

everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong

<s>  then turning to me
served his majesty this man </s>
<s>  was a soldier in the line and bought his
discharge </s>
<s> 

i said indeed </s>
<s>  and the mans eyes looked at me and then looked over
my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across
his lips and laughed </s>
<s>

perhaps returned my friend but theres no knowing </s>

i am glad to have the chance of bidding you goodbye <abvr> wemmick said
the man stretching out his hand between two bars </s>
<s> 

thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him </s>
<s>  same to you colonel </s>

man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ringin acknowledgment of your attentions </s>

ill accept the will for the deed said wemmick </s>

quite a pigeonfancier </s>

had a remarkable breed of tumblers </s>

it shall be done sir </s>
<s> 

all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of </s>

said to me a coiner a very good workman </s>
<s>  the recorders report is
made today and he is sure to be executed on monday </s>
<s>  still you see as
far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same </s>
<s> 
 with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast
his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering
what other pot would go best in its place </s>
<s> 

as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less
than by those whom they held in charge </s>
<s>  well <abvr> wemmick said the
turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates

now thats the way with them here <abvr> pip remarked wemmick turning

the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street </s>

mind you <abvr> pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm
to be more confidential </s>

high </s>

mr </s>

suppliants for <abvr> jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual and i
returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice with some three
hours on hand </s>

that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i
should have first encountered it </s>

occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone </s>

mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud

sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled
its air from my lungs </s>

coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free

chapter xxxiii

in her furred travellingdress estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes </s>
<s>  her manner was more
winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i
saw miss havishams influence in the change </s>
<s> 

we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and
when it was all collected i rememberedhaving forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhilethat i knew nothing of her destination </s>
<s> 

i am going to richmond she told me </s>
<s>  our lesson is that there are
two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the
surrey richmond </s>
<s>  the distance is ten miles </s>
<s>  i am to have a carriage and
you are to take me </s>
<s>  this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out
of it </s>
<s>  o you must take the purse </s>
<s>  we have no choice you and i but to
obey our instructions </s>
<s>  we are not free to follow our own devices you
and i </s>
<s> 

as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words </s>
<s>  she said them slightingly but not with
displeasure </s>
<s> 

a carriage will have to be sent for estella </s>
<s>  will you rest here a
little </s>
<s> 

yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you
are to take care of me the while </s>
<s> 

she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his life to show us a private sittingroom </s>
<s>  upon that
he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clew without which he
couldnt find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the
establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous
article considering the holes proportions an anchovy saucecruet
and somebodys pattens </s>
<s>  on my objecting to this retreat he took us into
another room with a dinnertable for thirty and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust </s>
<s>  having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order </s>
<s>  which
proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room
in a very low state of mind </s>
<s> 

i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong
combination of stable with soupstock might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department </s>
<s> 
yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it </s>
<s>  i thought that
with her i could have been happy there for life </s>
<s>  i was not at all happy
there at the time observe and i knew it well </s>
<s> 

where are you going to at richmond </s>
<s>  i asked estella </s>
<s> 

i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there
who has the poweror says she hasof taking me about and introducing
me and showing people to me and showing me to people </s>
<s> 

i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration </s>
<s> 

yes i suppose so </s>
<s> 

she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if
you were some one else </s>
<s> 

where did you learn how i speak of others </s>
<s>  come come said estella
smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you </s>
<s>  i
must talk in my own way </s>
<s>  how do you thrive with <abvr> pocket </s>
<s> 

i live quite pleasantly there </s>
<s>  at least it appeared to me that i was
losing a chance </s>
<s> 

at least </s>
<s>  repeated estella </s>
<s> 

as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you </s>
<s> 

you silly boy said estella quite composedly how can you talk such
nonsense </s>
<s>  your friend <abvr> matthew i believe is superior to the rest of
his family </s>
<s> 

very superior indeed </s>
<s>  he is nobodys enemy

dont add but his own interposed estella for i hate that class of
man </s>
<s>  but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite
i have heard </s>
<s> 

i am sure i have every reason to say so </s>
<s> 

you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said
estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage </s>
<s>  they watch you misrepresent you
write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives </s>
<s>  you can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you </s>
<s> 

they do me no harm i hope </s>
<s> 

instead of answering estella burst out laughing </s>
<s>  this was very singular
to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity </s>
<s>  when she left
offand she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoymenti said
in my diffident way with her

i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm </s>
<s> 

no no you may be sure of that said estella </s>
<s>  you may be certain that
i laugh because they fail </s>
<s>  o those people with miss havisham and the
tortures they undergo </s>
<s>  she laughed again and even now when she had
told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not
doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion </s>
<s> 
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew </s>
<s>  she saw
the thought in my mind and answered it </s>
<s> 

it is not easy for even you </s>
<s>  said estella to know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous </s>
<s>  for you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby </s>
<s>  i was </s>
<s>  you had not
your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed
and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
is soft and soothing </s>
<s>  i had </s>
<s>  you did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
in the night </s>
<s>  i did </s>
<s> 

it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place </s>
<s>  i would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap </s>
<s> 

two things i can tell you said estella </s>
<s>  first notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set
your mind at rest that these people never willnever would in hundred
yearsimpair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great
or small </s>
<s>  second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it </s>
<s> 

as she gave it to me playfullyfor her darker mood had been but
momentaryi held it and put it to my lips </s>
<s>  you ridiculous boy said
estella will you never take warning </s>
<s>  or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek </s>
<s> 

what spirit was that </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

i must think a moment </s>
<s>  a spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters </s>
<s> 

if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again </s>
<s> 

you should have asked before you touched the hand </s>
<s>  but yes if you
like </s>
<s> 

i leaned down and her calm face was like a statues </s>
<s>  now said
estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take
care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond </s>
<s> 

her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us and we were mere puppets gave me pain </s>
<s>  but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain </s>
<s>  whatever her tone with me happened to be
i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it </s>
<s>  and yet i went on
against trust and against hope </s>
<s>  why repeat it a thousand times </s>
<s>  so it
always was </s>
<s> 

i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clew
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of
tea not a glimpse </s>
<s>  a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and
forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover
moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of
parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of
the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and
ultimately a fat family urn </s>
<s>  which the waiter staggered in with
expressing in his countenance burden and suffering </s>
<s>  after a prolonged
absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs </s>
<s>  these i steeped in hot
water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i
dont know what for estella </s>
<s> 

the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten
and the chambermaid taken into considerationin a word the whole
house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estellas purse
much lightenedwe got into our postcoach and drove away </s>
<s>  turning into
cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls
of which i was so ashamed </s>
<s> 

what place is that </s>
<s>  estella asked me </s>
<s> 

i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it and then
told her </s>
<s>  as she looked at it and drew in her head again
murmuring wretches </s>
<s>  i would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else
has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in london </s>
<s> 

he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a
low voice </s>
<s> 

you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose </s>
<s> 

i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since
i can remember </s>
<s>  but i know him no better now than i did before i could
speak plainly </s>
<s>  what is your own experience of him </s>
<s>  do you advance with
him </s>
<s> 

once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very
well </s>
<s> 

are you intimate </s>
<s> 

i have dined with him at his private house </s>
<s> 

i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place </s>
<s> 

it is a curious place </s>
<s> 

i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her </s>
<s>  but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas </s>
<s>  it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling i had had before </s>
<s>  and when we were out of
it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning </s>
<s> 

so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this
side of it and what on that </s>
<s>  the great city was almost new to her she
told me for she had never left miss havishams neighborhood until she
had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in
going and returning </s>
<s>  i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
while she remained here </s>
<s>  to that she emphatically said god forbid </s>
<s>  and
no more </s>
<s> 

it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me </s>
<s> 
that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains </s>
<s>  yet this made me none the happier for even if she had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have
felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do
it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush
it and throw it away </s>
<s> 

when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where <abvr> matthew
pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i
hoped i should see her sometimes </s>
<s> 

o yes you are to see me </s>
<s>  you are to come when you think proper </s>
<s>  you
are to be mentioned to the family </s>
<s>  indeed you are already mentioned </s>
<s> 

i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  there are only two </s>
<s>  mother and daughter </s>
<s>  the mother is a lady of
some station though not averse to increasing her income </s>
<s> 

i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon </s>
<s> 

it is a part of miss havishams plans for me pip said estella with
a sigh as if she were tired </s>
<s>  i am to write to her constantly and see
her regularly and report how i go oni and the jewelsfor they are
nearly all mine now </s>
<s> 

it was the first time she had ever called me by my name </s>
<s>  of course she
did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up </s>
<s> 

we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house
by the greena staid old house where hoops and powder and patches
embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their
court days many a time </s>
<s>  some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts </s>
<s>  but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest </s>
<s> 

a bell with an old voicewhich i dare say in its time had often said
to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamondhilted
sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded
gravely in the moonlight and two cherrycolored maids came fluttering
out to receive estella </s>
<s>  the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she
gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed
likewise </s>
<s>  and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i
should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy
with her but always miserable </s>
<s> 

i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in
with a bad heartache and i got out with a worse heartache </s>
<s>  at our
own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her little lover </s>
<s>  and i envied her little lover in spite of
his being subject to flopson </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket was out lecturing </s>
<s>  for he was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes </s>
<s>  but
mrs </s>
<s>  pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of
the babys having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet
during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards
of millers </s>
<s>  and more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heartache of begging him
to accept my confidence </s>
<s>  but happening to look up at <abvr> pocket as she
sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby i thoughtwellno i wouldnt </s>

chapter xxxiv

as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me </s>
<s>  their influence on
my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible
but i knew very well that it was not all good </s>
<s>  i lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to joe </s>
<s>  my conscience was not
by any means comfortable about biddy </s>
<s>  when i woke up in the nightlike
camillai used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should
have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havishams face
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest
old forge </s>
<s>  many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the
fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home </s>
<s> 

yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production </s>
<s>  that is to say supposing i had had no expectations
and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my
satisfaction that i should have done much better </s>
<s>  now concerning the
influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so
i perceivedthough dimly enough perhapsthat it was not beneficial
to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert </s>
<s> 
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace
with anxieties and regrets </s>
<s>  i was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor
arts they practised </s>
<s>  because such littlenesses were their natural
bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them
slumbering </s>
<s>  but herberts was a very different case and it often caused
me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing
the canarybreasted avenger at his disposal </s>
<s> 

so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began
to contract a quantity of debt </s>
<s>  i could hardly begin but herbert
must begin too so he soon followed </s>
<s>  at startops suggestion we put
ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove </s>
<s> 
the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs </s>
<s>  i know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society </s>
<s>  which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove </s>
<s> 

the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was
in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honor of
joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners </s>
<s>  occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage
headforemost over the apron </s>
<s>  and i saw him on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional waylike coals </s>
<s> 
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be
according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age </s>
<s> 

in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken
herberts expenses on myself </s>
<s>  but herbert was proud and i could make
no such proposal to him </s>
<s>  so he got into difficulties in every direction
and continued to look about him </s>
<s>  when we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a
desponding eye at breakfasttime </s>
<s>  that he began to look about him more
hopefully about midday </s>
<s>  that he drooped when he came into dinner </s>
<s> 
that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after
dinner </s>
<s>  that he all but realized capital towards midnight </s>
<s>  and that at
about two oclock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune </s>
<s> 

i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at
hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by </s>
<s>  herbert
would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet </s>
<s>  but in the general
tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was
a thing to transact itself somehow </s>
<s>  in the meantime <abvr> pocket grew
grayer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the
hair </s>
<s>  while <abvr> pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read
her book of dignities lost her pockethandkerchief told us about her
grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her notice </s>
<s> 

as i am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at barnards inn </s>
<s> 

we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us </s>
<s>  we were always more or less
miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition </s>
<s> 
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did </s>
<s>  to the best of my
belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one </s>
<s> 

every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look
about him </s>
<s>  i often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which
he consorted with an inkjar a hatpeg a coalbox a stringbox an
almanac a desk and stool and a ruler </s>
<s>  and i do not remember that i
ever saw him do anything else but look about him </s>
<s>  if we all did what
we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a
republic of the virtues </s>
<s>  he had nothing else to do poor fellow except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloydsin observance
of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think </s>
<s>  he never did anything
else in connection with lloyds that i could find out except come back
again </s>
<s>  when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively
must find an opening he would go on �change at a busy time and walk in
and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled
magnates </s>
<s>  for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an
opening wont come to one but one must go to itso i have been </s>
<s> 

if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning </s>
<s>  i detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the
sight of the avengers livery </s>
<s>  which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
fourandtwenty hours </s>
<s>  as we got more and more into debt breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at
breakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings not
unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery
 i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake
him off his feetso that he was actually in the air like a booted
cupidfor presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll </s>
<s> 

at certain timesmeaning at uncertain times for they depended on our
humori would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery

my dear herbert we are getting on badly </s>
<s> 

my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will
believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence </s>
<s> 

then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs </s>
<s> 

we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose </s>
<s>  i always thought this was business this was the way to
confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat </s>
<s>  and
i know herbert thought so too </s>
<s> 

we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark </s>
<s> 
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper </s>
<s>  for there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery </s>
<s> 

i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a
neat hand the heading memorandum of pips debts </s>
<s>  with barnards inn
and the date very carefully added </s>
<s>  herbert would also take a sheet of
paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of
herberts debts </s>
<s> 

each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side
which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half
burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the lookingglass and
otherwise damaged </s>
<s>  the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly
insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money </s>
<s>  in point of
meritorious character the two things seemed about equal </s>
<s> 

when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on </s>
<s> 
herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his accumulating figures </s>
<s> 

they are mounting up handel herbert would say </s>
<s>  upon my life they
are mounting up </s>
<s> 

be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great
assiduity </s>
<s>  look the thing in the face </s>
<s>  look into your affairs </s>
<s>  stare
them out of countenance </s>
<s> 

so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance </s>
<s> 

however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would
fall to work again </s>
<s>  after a time he would give up once more on the plea
that he had not got cobbss bill or lobbss or nobbss as the case
might be </s>
<s> 

then herbert estimate </s>
<s>  estimate it in round numbers and put it
down </s>
<s> 

what a fellow of resource you are </s>
<s>  my friend would reply with
admiration </s>
<s>  really your business powers are very remarkable </s>
<s> 

i thought so too </s>
<s>  i established with myself on these occasions
the reputation of a firstrate man of businessprompt decisive
energetic clear coolheaded </s>
<s>  when i had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off </s>
<s>  my
selfapproval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation </s>
<s> 
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly
docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle </s>
<s>  then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my
administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a
focus for him </s>
<s> 

my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving
a margin </s>
<s>  for example </s>
<s>  supposing herberts debts to be one hundred and
sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence i would say leave a margin and
put them down at two hundred </s>
<s>  or supposing my own to be four times as
much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred </s>

chapter xxxv

it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful </s>
<s>  the figure of my
sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day </s>
<s>  that
the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed
unable to compass </s>
<s>  and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door </s>
<s> 
in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were
still alive and had been often there </s>
<s> 

whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness </s>
<s>  but i suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness </s>
<s>  under its influence and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered
so much </s>
<s>  and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully
pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity </s>
<s> 

having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him
that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind i have glanced at </s>
<s>  i went down early in the
morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the
forge </s>
<s> 

it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times
when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me
vividly returned </s>
<s>  but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of tickler </s>
<s>  for now the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me </s>
<s> 

at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co </s>
<s>  had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession </s>
<s>  two dismally absurd
persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandageas if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybodywere posted at the front door </s>
<s>  and in one of them i
recognized a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck
with both arms </s>
<s>  all the children of the village and most of the women
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge </s>
<s>  and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy
knocked at the doorimplying that i was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself </s>
<s> 

another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a
wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlor </s>
<s>  here <abvr>
trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves
up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity
of black pins </s>
<s>  at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting
somebodys hat into black longclothes like an african baby </s>
<s>  so he held
out his hand for mine </s>
<s>  but i misled by the action and confused by the
occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection </s>
<s> 

poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room </s>
<s>  where
as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb </s>
<s>  when i bent
down and said to him dear joe how are you </s>
<s>  he said pip old chap
you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand
and said no more </s>
<s> 

biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly
here and there and was very helpful </s>
<s>  when i had spoken to biddy as
i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and
there began to wonder in what part of the house itshemy sisterwas </s>
<s> 
the air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweetcake i looked
about for the table of refreshments </s>
<s>  it was scarcely visible until one
had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cutup plum cake upon
it and there were cutup oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two
decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used
in all my life </s>
<s>  one full of port and one of sherry </s>
<s>  standing at this
table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak
and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself
and making obsequious movements to catch my attention </s>
<s>  the moment he
succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said
in a subdued voice may i dear sir </s>
<s>  and did </s>
<s>  i then descried <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  hubble </s>
<s>  the lastnamed in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner </s>
<s> 
we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up
separately by trabb into ridiculous bundles </s>
<s> 

which i meantersay pip joe whispered me as we were being what <abvr>
trabb called formed in the parlor two and twoand it was dreadfully
like a preparation for some grim kind of dance </s>
<s>  which i meantersay
sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself
along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts
and arms but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on
such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect </s>
<s> 

pockethandkerchiefs out all </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> trabb at this point in a
depressed businesslike voice </s>
<s>  pockethandkerchiefs out </s>
<s>  we are ready </s>
<s> 

so we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces as if our
noses were bleeding and filed out two and two </s>
<s>  joe and i </s>
<s>  biddy and
pumblechook </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> hubble </s>
<s>  the remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along
under the guidance of two keepersthe postboy and his comrade </s>
<s> 

the neighborhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we
were much admired as we went through the village </s>
<s>  the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage </s>
<s>  at such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come </s>
<s>  here they
are </s>
<s>  and we were all but cheered </s>
<s>  in this progress i was much annoyed
by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing
my cloak </s>
<s>  my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession </s>
<s> 

and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it </s>
<s>  and we went into the churchyard
close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this
parish and also georgiana wife of the above </s>
<s>  and there my sister was
laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees </s>
<s> 

of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing
i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me </s>
<s>  and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property </s>
<s>  when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that
he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honor and
to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her death </s>
<s>  after that he drank all the rest of the sherry
and <abvr> hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since
observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal </s>
<s>  finally he went
away with <abvr> and <abvr> hubbleto make an evening of it i felt sure
and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor </s>
<s> 

when they were all gone and when trabb and his menbut not his boy </s>
<s>  i
looked for himhad crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too
the house felt wholesomer </s>
<s>  soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a
cold dinner together </s>
<s>  but we dined in the best parlor not in the old
kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great
restraint upon us </s>
<s>  but after dinner when i made him take his pipe
and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better </s>
<s>  i
noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to
make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress </s>
<s>  in which
the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was </s>
<s> 

he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little
room and i was pleased too </s>
<s>  for i felt that i had done rather a great
thing in making the request </s>
<s>  when the shadows of evening were closing
in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a
little talk </s>
<s> 

biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad
matters </s>
<s> 

do you <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  i should have written if i had thought
that </s>
<s> 

dont suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider
that you ought to have thought that </s>
<s> 

do you <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with
her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again </s>
<s>  after
looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up
that point </s>
<s> 

i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i cant do so <abvr> pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction </s>
<s>  i have been speaking to <abvr> hubble and i am
going to her tomorrow </s>
<s>  i hope we shall be able to take some care of <abvr>
gargery together until he settles down </s>
<s> 

how are you going to live biddy </s>
<s>  if you want any mo

how am i going to live </s>
<s>  repeated biddy striking in with a momentary
flush upon her face </s>
<s>  ill tell you <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here </s>
<s>  i can be
well recommended by all the neighbors and i hope i can be industrious
and patient and teach myself while i teach others </s>
<s>  you know <abvr> pip
 pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new
schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after
that time and have had time since then to improve </s>
<s> 

i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy </s>
<s> 

it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 
i thought i would give up that point too </s>
<s>  so i walked a little further
with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes </s>
<s> 

i have not heard the particulars of my sisters death biddy </s>
<s> 

they are very slight poor thing </s>
<s>  she had been in one of her bad
statesthough they had got better of late rather than worsefor four
days when she came out of it in the evening just at teatime and said
quite plainly �joe </s>
<s>  as she had never said any word for a long while i
ran and fetched in <abvr> gargery from the forge </s>
<s>  she made signs to me that
she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms
round his neck </s>
<s>  so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down
on his shoulder quite content and satisfied </s>
<s>  and so she presently said
�joe again and once �pardon and once �pip </s>
<s>  and so she never lifted
her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her own bed because we found she was gone </s>
<s> 

biddy cried </s>
<s>  the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were
coming out were blurred in my own sight </s>
<s> 

nothing was ever discovered biddy </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s> 

do you know what is become of orlick </s>
<s> 

i should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the
quarries </s>
<s> 

of course you have seen him then </s>
<s> why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane </s>
<s> 

i saw him there on the night she died </s>
<s> 

that was not the last time either biddy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i have seen him there since we have been walking here </s>
<s> it is of
no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running
out you know i would not deceive you </s>
<s>  he was not there a minute and
he is gone </s>
<s> 

it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
this fellow and i felt inveterate against him </s>
<s>  i told her so and told
her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
that country </s>
<s>  by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she
told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anythingshe
didnt say of me </s>
<s>  she had no need </s>
<s>  i knew what she meantbut ever did
his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a
gentle heart </s>
<s> 

indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i </s>
<s>  and biddy
we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down
here now </s>
<s>  i am not going to leave poor joe alone </s>
<s> 

biddy said never a single word </s>
<s> 

biddy dont you hear me </s>
<s> 

yes <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

not to mention your calling me <abvr> pipwhich appears to me to be in
bad taste biddywhat do you mean </s>
<s> 

what do i mean </s>
<s>  asked biddy timidly </s>
<s> 

biddy said i in a virtuously selfasserting manner i must request
to know what you mean by this </s>
<s> 

by this </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s> 

now dont echo i retorted </s>
<s>  you used not to echo biddy </s>
<s> 

used not </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  o <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  used </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  i rather thought i would give up that point too </s>
<s>  after another
silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position </s>
<s> 

biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often
to see joe which you received with a marked silence </s>
<s>  have the goodness
biddy to tell me why </s>
<s> 

are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often </s>
<s>  asked
biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye </s>
<s> 

o dear me </s>
<s>  said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in
despair </s>
<s>  this really is a very bad side of human nature </s>
<s>  dont say any
more if you please biddy </s>
<s>  this shocks me very much </s>
<s> 

for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and
when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her
as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day </s>
<s>  as often as i was restless in the night and
that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what
an injury what an injustice biddy had done me </s>
<s> 

early in the morning i was to go </s>
<s>  early in the morning i was out and
looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge </s>
<s>  there
i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him were shining on it </s>
<s> 

goodbye dear joe </s>
<s> no dont wipe it offfor gods sake give me your
blackened hand </s>
<s> i shall be down soon and often </s>
<s> 

never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip </s>
<s> 

biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread </s>
<s>  biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting
i am not angry but i am hurt </s>
<s> 

no dont be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically </s>
<s>  let only me be
hurt if i have been ungenerous </s>

once more the mists were rising as i walked away </s>

me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy
was quite right all i can say isthey were quite right too </s>

chapter xxxvi

herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our
debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary
transactions </s>
<s>  and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing </s>
<s> 
and i came of agein fulfilment of herberts prediction that i should
do so before i knew where i was </s>
<s> 

herbert himself had come of age eight months before me </s>
<s>  as he had
nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a
profound sensation in barnards inn </s>
<s>  but we had looked forward to
my oneandtwentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion </s>
<s> 

i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my
birthday was </s>
<s>  on the day before it i received an official note from
wemmick informing me that <abvr> jaggers would be glad if i would call
upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day </s>
<s>  this convinced
us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual
flutter when i repaired to my guardians office a model of punctuality </s>
<s> 

in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
tissuepaper that i liked the look of </s>
<s>  but he said nothing respecting
it and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room </s>
<s>  it was november
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimneypiece with his hands under his coattails </s>
<s> 

well pip said he i must call you <abvr> pip today </s>
<s>  congratulations
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s> 

we shook handshe was always a remarkably short shakerand i thanked
him </s>
<s> 

take a chair <abvr> pip said my guardian </s>
<s> 

as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when
i had been put upon a tombstone </s>
<s>  the two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation </s>
<s> 

now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the
box i am going to have a word or two with you </s>
<s> 

if you please sir </s>
<s> 

what do you suppose said <abvr> jaggers bending forward to look at the
ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceilingwhat
do you suppose you are living at the rate of </s>
<s> 

at the rate of sir </s>
<s> 

at repeated <abvr> jaggers still looking at the ceiling
therateof </s>
<s>  and then looked all round the room and paused with his
pockethandkerchief in his hand halfway to his nose </s>
<s> 

i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings </s>
<s>  reluctantly
i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question </s>
<s>  this reply
seemed agreeable to <abvr> jaggers who said i thought so </s>
<s>  and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction </s>
<s> 

now i have asked you a question my friend said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  have
you anything to ask me </s>
<s> 

of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions sir </s>
<s>  but i remember your prohibition </s>
<s> 

ask one said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

is my benefactor to be made known to me today </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  ask another </s>
<s> 

is that confidence to be imparted to me soon </s>
<s> 

waive that a moment said <abvr> jaggers and ask another </s>
<s> 

i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry haveianything to receive sir </s>
<s>  on that <abvr> jaggers
said triumphantly i thought we should come to it </s>
<s>  and called to
wemmick to give him that piece of paper </s>
<s>  wemmick appeared handed it in
and disappeared </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip said <abvr> jaggers attend if you please </s>

drawing pretty freely here </s>

you know you must say yes </s>

yes sir </s>
<s> 

i dont ask you what you owe because you dont know </s>
<s>  and if you did
know you wouldnt tell me </s>
<s>  you would say less </s>
<s>  yes yes my friend
 cried <abvr> jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show
of protesting </s>
<s>  its likely enough that you think you wouldnt but
you would </s>
<s>  youll excuse me but i know better than you </s>
<s>  now take this
piece of paper in your hand </s>
<s>  you have got it </s>
<s>  very good </s>
<s>  now unfold it
and tell me what it is </s>
<s> 

this is a banknote said i for five hundred pounds </s>
<s> 

that is a banknote repeated <abvr> jaggers for five hundred pounds </s>
<s> 
and a very handsome sum of money too i think </s>
<s>  you consider it so </s>
<s> 

how could i do otherwise </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  but answer the question said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s> 

you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money </s>
<s>  now that
handsome sum of money pip is your own </s>
<s>  it is a present to you on this
day in earnest of your expectations </s>
<s>  and at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears </s>
<s>  that is to say you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick
one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter until you are in
communication with the fountainhead and no longer with the mere
agent </s>
<s>  as i have told you before i am the mere agent </s>
<s>  i execute my
instructions and i am paid for doing so </s>
<s>  i think them injudicious but
i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits </s>
<s> 

i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which i was treated when <abvr> jaggers stopped me </s>
<s>  i am
not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one </s>
<s>  and
then gathered up his coattails as he had gathered up the subject and
stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
him </s>
<s> 

after a pause i hinted

there was a question just now <abvr> jaggers which you desired me to
waive for a moment </s>
<s>  i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

i might have known that he would never help me out </s>
<s>  but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new </s>
<s>  is it
likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountainhead
you have spoken of <abvr> jaggers will soon there i delicately
stopped </s>
<s> 

will soon what </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  thats no question as it stands
you know </s>
<s> 

will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise
form of words or summon me anywhere else </s>
<s> 

now here replied <abvr> jaggers fixing me for the first time with
his dark deepset eyes we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village </s>
<s>  what did i tell you then pip </s>
<s> 

you told me <abvr> jaggers that it might be years hence when that person
appeared </s>
<s> 

just so said <abvr> jaggers thats my answer </s>
<s> 

as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him </s>
<s>  and as i felt that it came
quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him </s>
<s> 

do you suppose it will still be years hence <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers shook his headnot in negativing the question but in
altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
itand the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when
my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention and were going to sneeze </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs
of his warmed hands ill be plain with you my friend pip </s>
<s>  thats a
question i must not be asked </s>
<s>  youll understand that better when i tell
you its a question that might compromise me </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  ill go a little
further with you </s>
<s>  ill say something more </s>
<s> 

he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the
calves of his legs in the pause he made </s>
<s> 

when that person discloses said <abvr> jaggers straightening himself
you and that person will settle your own affairs </s>
<s>  when that person
discloses my part in this business will cease and determine </s>
<s>  when that
person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it </s>
<s>  and thats all i have got to say </s>
<s> 

we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked
thoughtfully at the floor </s>
<s>  from this last speech i derived the notion
that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him
into her confidence as to her designing me for estella </s>
<s>  that he resented
this and felt a jealousy about it </s>
<s>  or that he really did object to
that scheme and would have nothing to do with it </s>
<s>  when i raised my eyes
again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and
was doing so still </s>
<s> 

if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing
left for me to say </s>
<s> 

he nodded assent and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch and asked me
where i was going to dine </s>
<s>  i replied at my own chambers with herbert </s>
<s> 
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favor us with his
company and he promptly accepted the invitation </s>
<s>  but he insisted on
walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation
for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had
his hands to wash </s>
<s>  so i said i would go into the outer office and talk
to wemmick </s>
<s> 

the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before </s>
<s> 
and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought </s>
<s> 

he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home </s>
<s> 
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to
be extinguished </s>
<s>  he had raked his fire low put his hat and greatcoat
ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safekey as
an athletic exercise after business </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion </s>
<s>  i am very desirous
to serve a friend </s>
<s> 

wemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head as if his opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort </s>
<s> 

this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life
but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning </s>
<s>  now i want somehow to help him to a beginning </s>
<s> 

with money down </s>
<s>  said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust </s>
<s> 

with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at homewith some money down
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my
fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high
as chelsea reach </s>
<s>  lets see </s>
<s>  theres london one </s>
<s>  southwark two </s>
<s> 
blackfriars three </s>
<s>  waterloo four </s>
<s>  westminster five </s>
<s>  vauxhall six </s>
<s> 
 he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his
safekey on the palm of his hand </s>
<s>  theres as many as six you see to
choose from </s>
<s> 

i dont understand you said i </s>
<s> 

choose your bridge <abvr> pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon
your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch
of your bridge and you know the end of it </s>
<s>  serve a friend with it and
you may know the end of it toobut its a less pleasant and profitable
end </s>
<s> 

i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after
saying this </s>
<s> 

this is very discouraging said i </s>
<s> 

meant to be so said wemmick </s>
<s> 

then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation
that a man should never

invest portable property in a friend </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  certainly
he should not </s>
<s>  unless he wants to get rid of the friendand then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him </s>
<s> 

and that said i is your deliberate opinion <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole
here </s>
<s>  but would that be your opinion at walworth </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this
office is another </s>
<s>  much as the aged is one person and <abvr> jaggers is
another </s>
<s>  they must not be confounded together </s>
<s>  my walworth sentiments
must be taken at walworth </s>
<s>  none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office </s>
<s> 

very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at
walworth you may depend upon it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and
personal capacity </s>
<s> 

we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardians
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp </s>
<s>  as he now appeared in his doorway
towelling his hands wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff
out the candles </s>
<s>  we all three went into the street together and from
the doorstep wemmick turned his way and <abvr> jaggers and i turned ours </s>
<s> 

i could not help wishing more than once that evening that <abvr> jaggers
had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or
a somebody to unbend his brows a little </s>
<s>  it was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twentyfirst birthday that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it </s>
<s>  he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to
dinner </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because
after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the
fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it he felt so dejected and guilty </s>

chapter xxxvii

deeming sunday the best day for taking <abvr> wemmicks walworth
sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the castle </s>
<s>  on arriving before the battlements i found the union
jack flying and the drawbridge up </s>
<s>  but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the aged </s>
<s> 

my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather
had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word
that he would soon be home from his afternoons walk </s>
<s>  he is very regular
in his walks is my son </s>
<s>  very regular in everything is my son </s>
<s> 

i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and
we went in and sat down by the fireside </s>
<s> 

you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his
chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i
expect </s>
<s>  i nodded </s>
<s>  hah </s>
<s>  i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his business sir </s>
<s>  i nodded hard </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  so they tell me </s>
<s>  his business
is the law </s>
<s>  i nodded harder </s>
<s>  which makes it more surprising in my
son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to
the winecoopering </s>
<s> 

curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of <abvr> jaggers i roared that name at him </s>
<s>  he threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner no to be sure </s>
<s>  youre right </s>
<s>  and to this hour i
have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i
had made </s>
<s> 

as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making
some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own
calling in life had been the winecoopering </s>
<s>  by dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood </s>
<s> 

no said the old gentleman </s>
<s>  the warehousing the warehousing </s>
<s>  first
over yonder </s>
<s>  he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he
intended to refer me to liverpool </s>
<s>  and then in the city of london here </s>
<s> 
however having an infirmityfor i am hard of hearing sir

i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment </s>
<s> 

yes hard of hearing </s>
<s>  having that infirmity coming upon me my son he
went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property </s>
<s>  but returning to what you
said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i
say is no to be sure </s>
<s>  youre right </s>
<s> 

i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with john upon it </s>
<s>  the old man following my eyes cried
with great triumph my sons come home </s>
<s>  and we both went out to the
drawbridge </s>
<s> 

it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease </s>
<s>  the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge
that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had
come across and had presented me to miss skiffins </s>
<s>  a lady by whom he
was accompanied </s>
<s> 

miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in
the postoffice branch of the service </s>
<s>  she might have been some two or
three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed
of portable property </s>
<s>  the cut of her dress from the waist upward both
before and behind made her figure very like a boys kite </s>
<s>  and i might
have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a
little too intensely green </s>
<s>  but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow
and showed a high regard for the aged </s>
<s>  i was not long in discovering
that she was a frequent visitor at the castle </s>
<s>  for on our going in
and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney and disappeared </s>
<s>  presently another click
came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it </s>
<s> 
then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open </s>
<s>  then miss skiffins
and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together </s>
<s>  on
wemmicks return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed
the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you
know theyre both pleasant and useful to the aged </s>
<s>  and by george sir
its a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to
this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss
skiffins and me </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands
out of his own head </s>
<s> 

while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property
and see how the island looked in wintertime </s>
<s>  thinking that he did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle </s>
<s> 

having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i
had never hinted at it before </s>
<s>  i informed wemmick that i was anxious in
behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how
we had fought </s>
<s>  i glanced at herberts home and at his character and
at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for </s>
<s> 
those uncertain and unpunctual </s>
<s>  i alluded to the advantages i had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i
confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might
have done better without me and my expectations </s>
<s>  keeping miss havisham
in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of
his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts
retaliations or designs </s>
<s>  for all these reasons i told wemmick
and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great
affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmicks experience and
knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to
help herbert to some present incomesay of a hundred a year to keep
him in good hope and heartand gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership </s>
<s>  i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help
must always be rendered without herberts knowledge or suspicion and
that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise </s>
<s>  i
wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i cant help
confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you </s>
<s>  but that
is your fault in having ever brought me here </s>
<s> 

wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of
start well you know <abvr> pip i must tell you one thing </s>
<s>  this is
devilish good of you </s>
<s> 

say youll help me to be good then said i </s>
<s> 

ecod replied wemmick shaking his head thats not my trade </s>
<s> 

nor is this your tradingplace said i </s>
<s> 

you are right he returned </s>
<s>  you hit the nail on the head </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip
ill put on my consideringcap and i think all you want to do may be
done by degrees </s>
<s>  skiffins thats her brother is an accountant and
agent </s>
<s>  ill look him up and go to work for you </s>
<s> 

i thank you ten thousand times </s>
<s> 

on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there
are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away </s>
<s> 

after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into
the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea </s>
<s>  the responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger
of melting his eyes </s>
<s>  it was no nominal meal that we were going to make
but a vigorous reality </s>
<s>  the aged prepared such a haystack of buttered
toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the topbar </s>
<s>  while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and
repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment </s>
<s> 

the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right
moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep </s>
<s>  nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of
john and miss skiffins </s>
<s>  which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used
to it </s>
<s>  i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffinss
arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night </s>
<s>  and i rather
suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a
piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick </s>
<s> 

we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it </s>
<s>  the aged
especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe just oiled </s>
<s>  after a short pause of repose miss skiffinsin the
absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of
her family on sunday afternoonswashed up the teathings in a trifling
ladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us </s>
<s>  then she put on
her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now
aged parent tip us the paper </s>
<s> 

wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this
was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud </s>
<s>  i wont offer an apology said
wemmick for he isnt capable of many pleasuresare you aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself
spoken to </s>
<s> 

only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper
 said wemmick and hell be as happy as a king </s>
<s>  we are all attention
aged one </s>
<s> 

all right john all right </s>
<s>  returned the cheerful old man so busy and
so pleased that it really was quite charming </s>
<s> 

the ageds reading reminded me of the classes at <abvr> wopsles
greataunts with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole </s>
<s>  as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was
always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
them he required as much watching as a powdermill </s>
<s>  but wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on
quite unconscious of his many rescues </s>
<s>  whenever he looked at us we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he
resumed again </s>
<s> 

as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy
corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of <abvr> wemmicks mouth
powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round
miss skiffinss waist </s>
<s>  in course of time i saw his hand appear on the
other side of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  but at that moment miss skiffins neatly
stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were
an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her </s>
<s>  miss skiffinss composure while she did this was one
of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have
deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically </s>
<s> 

by and by i noticed wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again and
gradually fading out of view </s>
<s>  shortly afterwards his mouth began to
widen again </s>
<s>  after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side
of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid
it on the table </s>
<s>  taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the ageds reading
wemmicks arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by miss skiffins </s>
<s> 

at last the aged read himself into a light slumber </s>
<s>  this was the time
for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a
black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect </s>
<s>  with the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who
was soon awake again </s>
<s>  miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and
wemmick drank out of one glass </s>
<s>  of course i knew better than to offer to
see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best
go first </s>
<s>  which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having
passed a pleasant evening </s>
<s> 

before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth
stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would
be glad if i could come and see him again upon it </s>
<s>  so i went out
to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by
appointment in the city several times but never held any communication
with him on the subject in or near little britain </s>
<s>  the upshot was
that we found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker not long
established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted
capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner </s>
<s> 
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the
subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged
for sundry other payments </s>
<s>  some to fall due at certain dates out of my
income </s>
<s>  some contingent on my coming into my property </s>
<s>  miss skiffinss
brother conducted the negotiation </s>
<s>  wemmick pervaded it throughout but
never appeared in it </s>
<s> 

the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it </s>
<s>  i never shall forget the radiant
face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty
piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young
merchants name and of clarrikers having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at
last </s>
<s>  day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so
happy </s>
<s>  at length the thing being done and he having that day entered
clarrikers house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when
i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody </s>
<s> 

a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my
view </s>
<s>  but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all
the changes it involved i must give one </s>
<s> to estella </s>
<s>  it is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart </s>

chapter xxxviii

if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to
be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost </s>
<s>  o
the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when estella lived there </s>
<s>  let my body be where it
would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that
house </s>
<s> 

the lady with whom estella was placed <abvr> brandley by name was a
widow with one daughter several years older than estella </s>
<s>  the mother
looked young and the daughter looked old </s>
<s>  the mothers complexion was
pink and the daughters was yellow </s>
<s>  the mother set up for frivolity
and the daughter for theology </s>
<s>  they were in what is called a good
position and visited and were visited by numbers of people </s>
<s>  little
if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her and
that she was necessary to them </s>
<s>  <abvr> brandley had been a friend of miss
havishams before the time of her seclusion </s>
<s> 

in <abvr> brandleys house and out of <abvr> brandleys house i suffered
every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me </s>
<s>  the
nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor conduced to my distraction </s>
<s> 
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her </s>
<s>  if i had been her secretary steward
halfbrother poor relationif i had been a younger brother of her
appointed husbandi could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when i was nearest to her </s>
<s>  the privilege of calling her by her
name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials </s>
<s>  and while i think it likely that it almost
maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened
me </s>
<s> 

she had admirers without end </s>
<s>  no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her </s>
<s>  but there were more than enough of them
without that </s>
<s> 

i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used
often to take her and the brandleys on the water </s>
<s>  there were picnics
fête days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures
through which i pursued herand they were all miseries to me </s>
<s>  i never
had one hours happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the
fourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me
unto death </s>
<s> 

throughout this part of our intercourseand it lasted as will
presently be seen for what i then thought a long timeshe habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us </s>
<s>  there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me </s>
<s> 

pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond </s>
<s>  will you never
take warning </s>

of what </s>
<s> 

of me </s>
<s> 

warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella </s>
<s> 

do i mean </s>
<s>  if you dont know what i mean you are blind </s>
<s> 

i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the
reason that i always was restrainedand this was not the least of my
miseriesby a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her
when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham </s>
<s>  my
dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom </s>
<s> 

at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you
wrote to me to come to you this time </s>
<s> 

thats true said estella with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me </s>

after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on
to say </s>

at satis </s>

you can then </s>
<s>  the day after tomorrow if you please </s>
<s>  you are to pay
all charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your going </s>
<s> 

and must obey said i </s>
<s> 

this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others
like it </s>
<s>  miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen
her handwriting </s>
<s>  we went down on the next day but one and we found her
in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that
there was no change in satis house </s>
<s> 

she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when
i last saw them together </s>
<s>  i repeat the word advisedly for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces </s>
<s> 
she hung upon estellas beauty hung upon her words hung upon her
gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at
her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared </s>
<s> 

from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds </s>
<s>  how does she use you pip </s>
<s>  how
does she use you </s>
<s>  she asked me again with her witchlike eagerness
even in estellas hearing </s>
<s>  but when we sat by her flickering fire
at night she was most weird </s>
<s>  for then keeping estellas hand drawn
through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her
by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular
letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated </s>
<s> 
and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch
stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a
very spectre </s>
<s> 

i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakenedi saw in this that
estella was set to wreak miss havishams revenge on men and that she
was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term </s>
<s>  i saw
in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me </s>
<s>  sending her
out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with
the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose </s>
<s>  i saw in
this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while
the prize was reserved for me </s>
<s>  i saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardians declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme </s>
<s>  in a word i
saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes
and always had had her before my eyes </s>
<s>  and i saw in this the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden
from the sun </s>
<s> 

the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall </s>
<s>  they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed </s>
<s>  as i looked
round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped
clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and
thrown back to me </s>
<s>  my thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor </s>
<s> 

it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between estella and miss havisham </s>
<s>  it was the first time i had ever seen
them opposed </s>
<s> 

we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham
still had estellas arm drawn through her own and still clutched
estellas hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself </s>
<s> 
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired
of me </s>
<s> 

only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm
and moving to the great chimneypiece where she stood looking down at
the fire </s>

estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was
not otherwise disturbed </s>

i cannot think said estella raising her eyes after a silence why

i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes </s>

<s>  if you

daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and
angry </s>

miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and
swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer </s>
<s> 

or said estellawhich is a nearer caseif you had taught her
from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might
that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had
blighted you and would else blight her </s>
<s> if you had done this and then
for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry </s>
<s> 

miss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her
face but still made no answer </s>
<s> 

so said estella i must be taken as i have been made </s>
<s>  the success is
not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me </s>
<s> 

miss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among
the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn </s>
<s>  i took advantage of
the momenti had sought one from the firstto leave the room after
beseeching estellas attention to her with a movement of my hand </s>
<s>  when
i left estella was yet standing by the great chimneypiece just as she
had stood throughout </s>
<s>  miss havishams gray hair was all adrift upon the
ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see </s>
<s> 

it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an
hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about
the ruined garden </s>
<s>  when i at last took courage to return to the room i
found estella sitting at miss havishams knee taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and
of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals </s>
<s>  afterwards estella
and i played at cards as of yoreonly we were skilful now and played
french gamesand so the evening wore away and i went to bed </s>
<s> 

i lay in that separate building across the courtyard </s>
<s>  it was the first
time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to
come near me </s>
<s>  a thousand miss havishams haunted me </s>
<s>  she was on this side
of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the
halfopened door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the room
overhead in the room beneatheverywhere </s>
<s>  at last when the night was
slow to creep on towards two oclock i felt that i absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up </s>
<s> 
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind </s>
<s>  but i was no sooner in the passage
than i extinguished my candle </s>
<s>  for i saw miss havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner making a low cry </s>
<s>  i followed her at a distance
and saw her go up the staircase </s>
<s>  she carried a bare candle in her hand
which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room
and was a most unearthly object by its light </s>
<s>  standing at the bottom
of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feastchamber without
seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across
into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low
cry </s>
<s>  after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back
but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands </s>
<s>  during the whole interval whenever i went to
the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass
above and heard her ceaseless low cry </s>
<s> 

before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between
her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion </s>
<s>  and
there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance </s>
<s>  nor
did miss havishams manner towards estella in anywise change except
that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley
drummles name upon it </s>
<s>  or i would very gladly </s>
<s> 

on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodys agreeing
with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order
forasmuch as <abvr> drummle had not yet toasted a lady </s>
<s>  which according
to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brutes turn to
do that day </s>
<s>  i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us
that might easily be </s>
<s>  what was my indignant surprise when he called upon
the company to pledge him to estella </s>
<s> 

estella who </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

never you mind retorted drummle </s>
<s> 

estella of where </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  you are bound to say of where </s>
<s>  which he
was as a finch </s>
<s> 

of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question
and a peerless beauty </s>
<s> 

much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot </s>
<s>  i
whispered herbert </s>
<s> 

i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had
been honored </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

and so do i i added with a scarlet face </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s>  o lord </s>
<s> 

this was the only retortexcept glass or crockerythat the heavy
creature was capable of making </s>
<s>  but i became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place
and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honorable
finchs impudence to come down to that grovewe always talked
about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of
expressiondown to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew
nothing </s>
<s>  <abvr> drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by
that </s>
<s>  whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew
where i was to be found </s>
<s> 

whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood
after this was a question on which the finches were divided </s>
<s>  the debate
upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honorable members
told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where
they were to be found </s>
<s>  however it was decided at last the grove being
a court of honor that if <abvr> drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honor of her
acquaintance <abvr> pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a
finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which </s>
<s>  next day was
appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from
delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
estellas hand that she had had the honor of dancing with him several
times </s>
<s>  this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed
into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the
idea that i was to be found anywhere </s>
<s>  drummle and i then sat snorting
at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate </s>
<s> 

i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me </s>
<s>  for i cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should
show any favor to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below
the average </s>
<s>  to the present moment i believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound </s>
<s> 
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored </s>
<s>  but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress </s>
<s> 

it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle
had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it </s>
<s>  a
little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed
one another every day </s>
<s>  he held on in a dull persistent way and estella
held him on </s>
<s>  now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost
flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now
scarcely remembering who he was </s>
<s> 

the spider as <abvr> jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait
however and had the patience of his tribe </s>
<s>  added to that he had a
blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness
which sometimes did him good servicealmost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose </s>
<s>  so the spider doggedly watching
estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time </s>
<s> 

at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls
at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties
this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration
on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him </s>
<s>  i took the
next opportunity </s>
<s>  which was when she was waiting for <abvr> blandley to
take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go </s>
<s> 
i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such
places </s>
<s>

rather pip </s>

your wordsthat i need look at </s>

no i returned </s>
<s>  but cannot the estella help it </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she laughing after a moment perhaps </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  anything you
like </s>
<s> 

but estella do hear me speak </s>
<s>  it makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as drummle </s>

despised </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

you know he is as ungainly within as without </s>
<s>  a deficient
illtempered lowering stupid fellow </s>

well </s>

<s> 

you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
roll of addleheaded predecessors </s>
<s>  now dont you </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she again </s>
<s>  and each time she said it she opened her lovely
eyes the wider </s>
<s> 

to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it
from her and said repeating it with emphasis well </s>
<s>  then that is why
it makes me wretched </s>
<s> 

now if i could have believed that she favored drummle with any idea of
making memewretched i should have been in better heart about it </s>
<s> 
but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the
question that i could believe nothing of the kind </s>

pip said estella casting her glance over the room dont be foolish
about its effect on you </s>
<s>  it may have its effect on others and may be
meant to have </s>
<s>  its not worth discussing </s>
<s> 

yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say �she
throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the
crowd </s>
<s> 

i can bear it said estella </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dont be so proud estella and so inflexible </s>
<s> 

calls me proud and inflexible in this breath </s>
<s>  said estella opening
her hands </s>
<s>  and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor </s>
<s> 

there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have
seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never
give tome </s>
<s> 

do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and
serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you </s>

yes and many othersall of them but you </s>

heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered
to the event that had impended over me longer yet </s>

begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella

distortions from miss havishams wasting hands </s>

axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his

mud deep in all the streets </s>
<s>  day after day a vast heavy veil had been
driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east

<s>  so furious had been the gusts
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs </s>

and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills
carried away </s>

shipwreck and death </s>
<s>  violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages

alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time

that the coalfires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain </s>

circle of light was very contracted </s>

strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched

moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially
dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea </s>

hair </s>

on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to

of me biting a long end of it </s>
<s>  i think he answered still with the
end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank
you afore i go </s>
<s> 

there was a tray ready on a sidetable </s>
<s>  i brought it to the table
near the fire and asked him what he would have </s>
<s>  he touched one of the
bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum
and water </s>
<s>  i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look
at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his
neckerchief between his teethevidently forgottenmade my hand very
difficult to master </s>
<s>  when at last i put the glass to him i saw with
amazement that his eyes were full of tears </s>
<s> 

up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished
him gone </s>
<s>  but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt
a touch of reproach </s>
<s>  i hope said i hurriedly putting something into
a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not
think i spoke harshly to you just now </s>
<s>  i had no intention of doing it
and i am sorry for it if i did </s>

<s> 

as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his
neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched
out his hand </s>
<s>  i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve
across his eyes and forehead </s>
<s> 

how are you living </s>
<s>  i asked him </s>
<s> 

ive been a sheepfarmer stockbreeder other trades besides away in

i hope to hear you say so my dear boy </s>
<s> 

without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which
they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my
mind </s>
<s> 

have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since
he undertook that trust </s>
<s> 

never set eyes upon him </s>
<s>  i warnt likely to it </s>
<s> 

he came faithfully and he brought me the two onepound notes </s>
<s>  i was
a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little
fortune </s>
<s>  but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay
them back </s>
<s>  you can put them to some other poor boys use </s>
<s>  i took out my
purse </s>
<s> 

he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he
watched me as i separated two onepound notes from its contents </s>
<s>  they
were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to
him </s>
<s>  still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them
longwise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped
the ashes into the tray </s>
<s> 

may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown
and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done
well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes </s>

<s> 

ah </s>
<s> 

he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with
his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf </s>
<s>  he put a foot up to the bars
to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam </s>
<s>  but he neither
looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me </s>
<s>  it was only
now that i began to tremble </s>
<s> 

when my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were
without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it
distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property </s>

with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose
out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking
wildly at him </s>

concerning a guardian he went on </s>

guardian or suchlike whiles you was a minor </s>

i stood with a hand on the chairback and a hand on my breast where
i seemed to be suffocatingi stood so looking wildly at him until i
grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn </s>
<s>  he caught
me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one
knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i
shuddered at very near to mine </s>

in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly
fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this </s>
<s>  it was the one
grain of relief i had </s>
<s> 

lookee here </s>
<s>  he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and
turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his

cold within me </s>

over his eyes and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well
rememberedand he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much

to myself �im making a better gentleman nor ever youll be </s>

one of �em says to another �he was a convict a few year ago and is a

broughtup london gentleman </s>
<s>  this way i kep myself a going </s>
<s>  and this
way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day
and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground </s>
<s> 

he laid his hand on my shoulder </s>
<s>  i shuddered at the thought that for
anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood </s>
<s> 

it warnt easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warnt
safe </s>
<s>  but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for
i was determined and my mind firm made up </s>
<s>  at last i done it </s>
<s>  dear boy
i done it </s>
<s> 

i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned </s>
<s>  throughout i had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him </s>
<s> 
even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those
were loud and his was silent </s>
<s> 

where will you put me </s>
<s>  he asked presently </s>
<s>  i must be put somewheres
dear boy </s>
<s> 

to sleep </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and to sleep long and sound he answered </s>
<s>  for ive been
seatossed and seawashed months and months </s>
<s> 

my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent </s>
<s>  you
must have his room </s>
<s> 

he wont come back tomorrow </s>
<s>  will he </s>
<s> 

no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost
efforts </s>
<s>  not tomorrow </s>
<s> 

because lookee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is
necessary </s>
<s> 

how do you mean </s>
<s>  caution </s>
<s> 

by g its death </s>
<s> 

whats death </s>
<s> 

i was sent for life </s>
<s>  its death to come back </s>
<s>  theres been overmuch
coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if
took </s>
<s> 

nothing was needed but this </s>
<s>  the wretched man after loading wretched me
with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come
to me and i held it there in my keeping </s>
<s>  if i had loved him instead
of abhorring him </s>
<s>  if i had been attracted to him by the strongest
admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the
strongest repugnance </s>
<s>  it could have been no worse </s>
<s>  on the contrary it
would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart </s>
<s> 

my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen
from without and then to close and make fast the doors </s>
<s>  while i did so
he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit </s>
<s>  and when i saw
him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again </s>
<s>  it
almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his
leg </s>
<s> 

when i had gone into herberts room and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed </s>
<s> 
he said yes but asked me for some of my gentlemans linen to put
on in the morning </s>
<s>  i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my
blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good
night </s>
<s> 

i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go
to bed </s>
<s>  for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think </s>
<s>  and it
was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i
was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces </s>
<s> 

miss havishams intentions towards me all a mere dream </s>
<s>  estella not
designed for me </s>
<s>  i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a
sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand </s>
<s>  those were the first
smarts i had </s>
<s>  but sharpest and deepest pain of allit was for the
convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door
that i had deserted joe </s>
<s> 

i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to
biddy now for any consideration </s>
<s>  simply i suppose because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration </s>
<s> 
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity </s>
<s>  but i could never never
undo what i had done </s>
<s> 

in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers </s>
<s>  twice i could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door </s>
<s>  with
these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had
mysterious warnings of this mans approach </s>
<s>  that for weeks gone by i
had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his </s>
<s>  that these
likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had
drawn nearer </s>
<s>  that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word
and with me </s>
<s> 

crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen
him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man </s>
<s>  that i had
heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him </s>
<s>  that
i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast </s>
<s>  out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a
halfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him in the dead of the wild solitary night </s>
<s>  this dilated until it filled
the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden </s>
<s> 

he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and
lowering in his sleep </s>
<s>  but he was asleep and quietly too though he had
a pistol lying on the pillow </s>
<s>  assured of this i softly removed the key
to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down
by the fire </s>
<s>  gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor </s>
<s> 
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five
the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness </s>
<s> 

this is the end of the second stage of pips expectations </s>
<s> 




chapter xl

it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far
as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor </s>
<s>  for this thought pressing
on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance </s>
<s> 

the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
selfevident </s>
<s>  it could not be done and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion </s>
<s>  true i had no avenger in my service now
but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an
animated ragbag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration </s>
<s>  they both had
weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted </s>
<s>  indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny </s>
<s>  not to get up a mystery
with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country </s>
<s> 

this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light </s>
<s>  not stumbling on the means after all
i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his lantern </s>
<s>  now in groping my way down the black staircase i
fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner </s>
<s> 

as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded
my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly </s>
<s>  telling him of the incident on the way back </s>
<s>  the wind being as
fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there </s>
<s>  it then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms </s>
<s>  so lighting my candle at the watchmans and leaving him
standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep </s>
<s>  all was quiet and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers </s>
<s> 

it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on
that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram
at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out </s>
<s>  yes he said </s>
<s>  at different times of the
night three </s>
<s>  one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in
the lane and he had seen them all go home </s>
<s>  again the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the
night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
upstairs </s>
<s> 

the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back
my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate </s>
<s>  besides them three
gentlemen that i have named i dont call to mind another since about
eleven oclock when a stranger asked for you </s>
<s> 

my uncle i muttered </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> 

you saw him sir </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  oh yes </s>
<s> 

likewise the person with him </s>
<s> 

person with him </s>
<s>  i repeated </s>
<s> 

i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman </s>
<s>  the person
stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this
way when he took this way </s>
<s> 

what sort of person </s>
<s> 

the watchman had not particularly noticed </s>
<s>  he should say a working
person </s>
<s>  to the best of his belief he had a dustcolored kind of clothes
on under a dark coat </s>
<s>  the watchman made more light of the matter than i
did and naturally </s>
<s>  not having my reason for attaching weight to it </s>
<s> 

when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together </s>
<s>  whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apartas for instance some diner out or diner at home
who had not gone near this watchmans gate might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep thereand my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him to show him the waystill joined they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me </s>
<s> 

i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning and fell into a doze before it </s>
<s>  i seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six </s>
<s>  as there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight i dozed again </s>
<s>  now waking up uneasily
with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears </s>
<s>  now making thunder
of the wind in the chimney </s>
<s>  at length falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start </s>
<s> 

all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor
could i do so yet </s>
<s>  i had not the power to attend to it </s>
<s>  i was greatly
dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way </s>
<s> 
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an
elephant </s>
<s>  when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning all of a leaden hue </s>
<s>  when i walked from room to room </s>
<s>  when i
sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to
appear </s>
<s>  i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long
i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even
who i was that made it </s>
<s> 

at last the old woman and the niece came inthe latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her dusty broomand testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire </s>
<s>  to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly </s>
<s>  then i washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust </s>
<s>  and so in a sort of dream
or sleepwaking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting
forhimto come to breakfast </s>
<s> 

by and by his door opened and he came out </s>
<s>  i could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight </s>
<s> 

i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the
table by what name to call you </s>
<s>  i have given out that you are my
uncle </s>
<s> 

thats it dear boy </s>
<s>  call me uncle </s>
<s> 

you assumed some name i suppose on board ship </s>
<s> 

yes dear boy </s>
<s>  i took the name of provis </s>
<s> 

do you mean to keep that name </s>
<s> 

why yes dear boy its as good as anotherunless youd like
another </s>

what is your real name </s>

<s> 

magwitch he answered in the same tone </s>
<s>  chrisend abel </s>
<s> 

what were you brought up to be </s>
<s> 

a warmint dear boy </s>
<s> 

he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some
profession </s>
<s> 

when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long
ago </s>
<s> 

yes dear boy </s>
<s> 

when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had
you any one with you </s>
<s> 

with me </s>
<s>  no dear boy </s>
<s> 

but there was some one there </s>
<s> 

i didnt take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the
ways of the place </s>
<s>  but i think there was a person too come in alonger
me </s>
<s> 

are you known in london </s>
<s> 

i hope not </s>
<s>  said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick </s>
<s> 

were you known in london once </s>
<s> 

not over and above dear boy </s>
<s>  i was in the provinces mostly </s>
<s>

the last time </s>
<s> 

he nodded </s>
<s>  first knowed <abvr> jaggers that way </s>
<s>  jaggers was for me </s>
<s> 

it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up
a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is
worked out and paid for </s>
<s>  fell to at his breakfast </s>
<s> 

he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions
were uncouth noisy and greedy </s>
<s>  some of his teeth had failed him since
i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth
and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon
it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog </s>
<s>  if i had begun with any
appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as
i didrepelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily
looking at the cloth </s>
<s> 

im a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology
when he made an end of his meal but i always was </s>
<s>  if it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter
trouble </s>
<s>  similarly i must have my smoke </s>
<s>  when i was first hired out as
shepherd tother side the world its my belief i should ha turned into
a molloncollymad sheep myself if i hadnt a had my smoke </s>
<s> 

as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the
breast of the peacoat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negrohead </s>
<s>  having
filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket
were a drawer </s>
<s>  then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs
and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearthrug with
his back to the fire and went through his favorite action of holding
out both his hands for mine </s>
<s> 

and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed
at his pipeand this is the gentleman what i made </s>
<s>  the real genuine
one </s>
<s>  it does me good fur to look at you pip </s>
<s>  all i stiplate is to
stand by and look at you dear boy </s>
<s> 

i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition </s>
<s>  what i was
chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his
hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides </s>
<s> 

i mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets </s>

and let him come out and ill face him and then ill believe in him
and not afore </s>
<s>  and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen </s>
<s> 

once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship </s>
<s>  smoking with great complacency all the while </s>
<s> 

it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert
returned </s>
<s>  whom i expected in two or three days </s>
<s>  that the secret must
be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i
could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with
him out of the question was plain to me </s>
<s>  but it was by no means so
plain to <abvr> provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved
his consent to herberts participation until he should have seen him
and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy </s>
<s>  and even then dear
boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of
his pocket well have him on his oath </s>
<s> 

to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to
state what i never quite established </s>
<s>  but this i can say that i never
knew him put it to any other use </s>
<s>  the book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge
of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave
him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm </s>
<s>  on this
first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself
last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude </s>
<s> 

as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next
discussed with him what dress he should wear </s>
<s>  he cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist </s>
<s>  it was with considerable
difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmers </s>
<s>  and we arranged that he should cut his hair close
and wear a little powder </s>
<s>  lastly as he had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until
his change of dress was made </s>
<s> 

it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions </s>
<s>  but in my
dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon </s>
<s>  he was to
remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account
to open the door </s>
<s> 

there being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in essex street
the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of
my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle <abvr> provis </s>
<s>  i then went from
shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his appearance </s>
<s>  this business transacted i turned my face on my own
account to little britain </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers was at his desk but seeing me
enter got up immediately and stood before his fire </s>
<s> 

now pip said he be careful </s>
<s> 

i will sir i returned </s>
<s>  for coming along i had thought well of what
i was going to say </s>
<s> 

dont commit yourself said <abvr> jaggers and dont commit any one </s>
<s> 
you understandany one </s>
<s>  dont tell me anything </s>
<s>  i dont want to know
anything </s>
<s>  i am not curious </s>
<s> 

of course i saw that he knew the man was come </s>
<s> 

i merely want <abvr> jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have
been told is true </s>
<s>  i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i
may verify it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers nodded </s>
<s>  but did you say �told or �informed </s>
<s>  he asked
me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in
a listening way at the floor </s>
<s>  told would seem to imply verbal
communication </s>
<s>  you cant have verbal communication with a man in new
south wales you know </s>
<s> 

i will say informed <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s> 

i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the
benefactor so long unknown to me </s>
<s> 

that is the man said <abvr> jaggers in new south wales </s>
<s> 

and only he </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

and only he said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions </s>
<s>  but i always supposed it was miss
havisham </s>
<s> 

as you say pip returned <abvr> jaggers turning his eyes upon
me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all
responsible for that </s>
<s> 

and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart </s>
<s> 

not a particle of evidence pip said <abvr> jaggers shaking his head
and gathering up his skirts </s>
<s>  take nothing on its looks </s>
<s>  take everything
on evidence </s>
<s>  theres no better rule </s>
<s> 

i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for
a little while </s>
<s>  i have verified my information and theres an end </s>
<s> 

and magwitchin new south waleshaving at last disclosed himself
 said <abvr> jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout
my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of
fact </s>
<s>  there has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact </s>
<s>  you are quite aware of that </s>
<s> 

quite sir </s>
<s> 

i communicated to magwitchin new south waleswhen he first wrote to
mefrom new south walesthe caution that he must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact </s>
<s>  i also communicated to him another
caution </s>
<s>  he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at
some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here </s>
<s>  i cautioned
him that i must hear no more of that </s>
<s>  that he was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon </s>
<s>  that he was expatriated for the term of his natural
life </s>
<s>  and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law </s>
<s>  i gave
magwitch that caution said <abvr> jaggers looking hard at me </s>
<s>  i wrote
it to new south wales </s>
<s>  he guided himself by it no doubt </s>
<s> 

no doubt said i </s>
<s> 

i have been informed by wemmick pursued <abvr> jaggers still looking
hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from
a colonist of the name of purvis or

or provis i suggested </s>
<s> 

or provisthank you pip </s>
<s>  perhaps it is provis </s>
<s>  perhaps you know its
provis </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s> 

you know its provis </s>
<s>  a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist
of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on
behalf of magwitch </s>
<s>  wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by
return of post </s>
<s>  probably it is through provis that you have received the
explanation of magwitchin new south wales </s>
<s> 

it came through provis i replied </s>
<s> 

good day pip said <abvr> jaggers offering his hand </s>
<s>  glad to have
seen you </s>
<s>  in writing by post to magwitchin new south walesor in
communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you
together with the balance </s>
<s>  for there is still a balance remaining </s>
<s>  good
day pip </s>
<s> 

we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me </s>
<s>  i
turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open
and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is </s>
<s> 

wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done
nothing for me </s>
<s>  i went straight back to the temple where i found
the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead in
safety </s>
<s> 

next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on </s>
<s> 
whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what
he had worn before </s>
<s>  to my thinking there was something in him that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him </s>
<s>  the more i dressed him and the
better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes </s>
<s>  this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no
doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me </s>
<s>  but i
believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in
the very grain of the man </s>
<s> 

the influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame </s>
<s>  added to these were the
influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all
his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now </s>
<s>  in all his ways of
sitting and standing and eating and drinkingof brooding about in a
highshouldered reluctant styleof taking out his great hornhandled
jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his foodof
lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy
pannikinsof chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the
most of an allowance and then drying his fingerends on it and then
swallowing itin these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon
bondsman plain as plain could be </s>
<s> 

it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts </s>
<s>  but i can compare the
effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead </s>
<s>  so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was
most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head </s>
<s>  it was
abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short </s>
<s> 

words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful
mystery that he was to me </s>
<s>  when he fell asleep of an evening with his
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair and his bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit
and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all
the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him </s>
<s>  every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and
the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back </s>
<s> 
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with
everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier </s>
<s> 

i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the
rain always rushing by </s>
<s>  a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that
he would be were no small addition to my horrors </s>
<s>  when he was not
asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his owna game that i never saw before or since and in which
he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the tablewhen
he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to
read to himforeign language dear boy </s>
<s>  while i complied he not
comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers
of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency </s>
<s>  the imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more
wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling
from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the
fonder he was of me </s>
<s> 

this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year </s>
<s>  it lasted
about five days </s>
<s>  expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out
except when i took provis for an airing after dark </s>
<s>  at length one
evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite
worn outfor my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreamsi was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase </s>
<s>  provis
who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an
instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand </s>
<s> 

quiet </s>
<s>  its herbert </s>
<s>  i said </s>
<s>  and herbert came bursting in with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him </s>
<s> 

handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again
how are you </s>
<s>  i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  why so i must have
been for you have grown quite thin and pale </s>
<s>  handel myhalloa </s>
<s>  i beg
your pardon </s>
<s> 

he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by
seeing provis </s>
<s>  provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly
putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something
else </s>
<s> 

herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while
herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has
happened </s>
<s>  this isa visitor of mine </s>
<s> 

its all right dear boy </s>
<s>  said provis coming forward with his little
clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert </s>
<s>  take it in
your right hand </s>
<s>  lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in
any way sumever </s>
<s>  kiss it </s>
<s> 

do so as he wishes it i said to herbert </s>
<s>  so herbert looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis
immediately shaking hands with him said now youre on your oath you
know </s>
<s>  and never believe me on mine if pip shant make a gentleman on
you </s>
<s> 




chapter xli

in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i
recounted the whole of the secret </s>
<s>  enough that i saw my own feelings
reflected in herberts face and not least among them my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me </s>
<s> 

what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there
had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story </s>
<s> 
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since
his returnon which point he began to hold forth to herbert the
moment my revelation was finishedhe had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune </s>
<s>  his boast that
he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the
character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for
himself </s>
<s>  and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us
and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite
established in his own mind </s>
<s> 

though lookee here pips comrade he said to herbert after having
discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come
backfor half a minuteive been low </s>
<s>  i said to pip i knowed as i had
been low </s>
<s>  but dont you fret yourself on that score </s>
<s>  i aint made pip a
gentleman and pip aint a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not
to know whats due to ye both </s>
<s>  dear boy and pips comrade you two may
count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on </s>
<s>  muzzled i have been
since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am
at the present time muzzled i ever will be </s>
<s> 

herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed </s>
<s>  we were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat
late </s>
<s>  it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and
saw him safely in at his own dark door </s>
<s>  when it closed upon him i
experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of
his arrival </s>
<s> 

never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs
i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in
bringing him back </s>
<s>  and i looked about me now </s>
<s>  difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements </s>
<s>  the few who were
passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i
turned back into the temple </s>
<s>  nobody had come out at the gate with us
nobody went in at the gate with me </s>
<s>  as i crossed by the fountain i saw
his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going
up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when i ascended it </s>
<s> 

herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend </s>
<s>  when he had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the
question what was to be done </s>
<s> 

the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stoodfor he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in
one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with
his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards
and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slatei say his
chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but
next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another </s>
<s>  he had
no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
patron neither had i occasion to confess my own </s>
<s>  we interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable </s>
<s> 

what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chairwhat is
to be done </s>
<s> 

my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned
to think </s>
<s> 

so was i herbert when the blow first fell </s>
<s>  still something must be
done </s>
<s>  he is intent upon various new expenseshorses and carriages
and lavish appearances of all kinds </s>
<s>  he must be stopped somehow </s>
<s> 

you mean that you cant accept

how can i </s>
<s>  i interposed as herbert paused </s>
<s>  think of him </s>
<s>  look at
him </s>
<s> 

an involuntary shudder passed over both of us </s>
<s> 

yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to
me strongly attached to me </s>
<s>  was there ever such a fate </s>
<s> 

my poor dear handel herbert repeated </s>
<s> 

then said i after all stopping short here never taking another
penny from him think what i owe him already </s>
<s>  then again </s>
<s>  i am heavily
in debtvery heavily for me who have now no expectationsand i have
been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing </s>
<s> 

well well well </s>
<s>  herbert remonstrated </s>
<s>  dont say fit for nothing </s>
<s> 

what am i fit for </s>
<s>  i know only one thing that i am fit for and that
is to go for a soldier </s>
<s>  and i might have gone my dear herbert but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection </s>
<s> 

of course i broke down there </s>
<s>  and of course herbert beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it </s>
<s> 

anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering wont do </s>
<s>  if
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors i suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had </s>
<s>  not very strong that hope if you went soldiering </s>
<s> 
besides its absurd </s>
<s>  you would be infinitely better in clarrikers
house small as it is </s>
<s>  i am working up towards a partnership you know </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  he little suspected with whose money </s>
<s> 

but there is another question said herbert </s>
<s>  this is an ignorant
determined man who has long had one fixed idea </s>
<s>  more than that he
seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character </s>
<s> 

i know he is i returned </s>
<s>  let me tell you what evidence i have seen
of it </s>
<s>  and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that
encounter with the other convict </s>
<s> 

see then said herbert </s>
<s>  think of this </s>
<s>  he comes here at the peril
of his life for the realization of his fixed idea </s>
<s>  in the moment of
realization after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from
under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him </s>
<s> 
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment </s>
<s> 

i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night
of his arrival </s>
<s>  nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
putting himself in the way of being taken </s>
<s> 

then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great
danger of his doing it </s>
<s>  that is his power over you as long as he remains
in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him </s>
<s> 

i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon
me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard
myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my
chair but began pacing to and fro </s>
<s>  i said to herbert meanwhile that
even if provis were recognized and taken in spite of himself i should
be wretched as the cause however innocently </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  even though i was so
wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would
ever have come to this </s>
<s> 

but there was no staving off the question what was to be done </s>
<s> 

the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him
out of england </s>
<s>  you will have to go with him and then he may be induced
to go </s>
<s> 

but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back </s>
<s> 

my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and
making him reckless here than elsewhere </s>
<s>  if a pretext to get him away
could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his
life now </s>
<s> 

there again </s>
<s>  said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held
out as if they contained the desperation of the case </s>
<s>  i know nothing
of his life </s>
<s>  it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so
unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood </s>
<s> 

herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and
fro together studying the carpet </s>
<s> 

handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

fully </s>
<s>  surely you would too if you were in my place </s>
<s> 

and you feel convinced that you must break with him </s>
<s> 

herbert can you ask me </s>
<s> 

and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he
has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from
throwing it away </s>
<s>  then you must get him out of england before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself </s>
<s>  that done extricate yourself in heavens
name and well see it out together dear old boy </s>
<s> 

it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again
with only that done </s>
<s> 

now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of
his history </s>
<s>  there is but one way that i know of </s>
<s>  i must ask him point
blank </s>

from her </s>
<s>  �yes yes all right </s>
<s>  �youre a good creetur he says
�dont leave me whatever you do and thank you </s>

he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and
then he starts up with a scream and screams out �here she is </s>

got the shroud again </s>

corner </s>

himself up hard and was dead </s>

compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides </s>

me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own
bookthis here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade
on </s>
<s> 

not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i donewhich �ud
take a weekill simply say to you dear boy and pips comrade that
that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave </s>
<s>  i was always
in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a
getting into danger </s>
<s>  he was younger than me but hed got craft and
hed got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and
no mercy </s>
<s>  my missis as i had the hard time wistop though </s>
<s>  i aint
brought her in

he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in
the book of his remembrance </s>
<s>  and he turned his face to the fire and
spread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them
on again </s>
<s> 

there aint no need to go into it he said looking round once more </s>
<s> 
the time wi compeyson was amost as hard a time as ever i had </s>
<s>  that
said alls said </s>
<s>  did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor
while with compeyson </s>
<s> 

i answered no </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  he said i was and got convicted </s>
<s>  as to took up on suspicion
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted </s>
<s> 
but evidence was wanting </s>
<s>  at last me and compeyson was both committed
for felonyon a charge of putting stolen notes in circulationand
there was other charges behind </s>
<s>  compeyson says to me �separate
defences no communication and that was all </s>
<s>  and i was so miserable
poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back
afore i could get jaggers </s>
<s> 

when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman
compeyson looked wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white
pockethandkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked </s>
<s>  when
the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i
noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him </s>
<s>  when the
evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had
come forard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money
had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing
and get the profit </s>
<s>  but when the defence come on then i see the plan
plainer </s>
<s>  for says the counsellor for compeyson �my lord and gentlemen
here you has afore you side by side two persons as your eyes can
separate wide </s>
<s>  one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to
as such </s>
<s>  one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such </s>

one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and
only suspected </s>
<s>  tother the elder always seen in �em and always wi his
guilt brought home </s>
<s>  can you doubt if there is but one in it which is
the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one </s>
<s>  and
suchlike </s>
<s>  and when it come to character warnt it compeyson as had
been to the school and warnt it his schoolfellows as was in this
position and in that and warnt it him as had been knowd by witnesses
in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage </s>
<s>  and warnt it
me as had been tried afore and as had been knowd up hill and down dale
in bridewells and lockups </s>
<s>  and when it come to speechmaking warnt it
compeyson as could speak to �em wi his face dropping every now and then
into his white pockethandkercherah </s>
<s>  and wi verses in his speech
tooand warnt it me as could only say �gentlemen this man at my
side is a most precious rascal </s>
<s>  and when the verdict come warnt it
compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and
bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me
and warnt it me as got never a word but guilty </s>
<s>  and when i says to
compeyson �once out of this court ill smash that face of yourn </s>
<s> 
aint it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two
turnkeys stood betwixt us </s>
<s>  and when were sentenced aint it him as
gets seven year and me fourteen and aint it him as the judge is
sorry for because he might a done so well and aint it me as the judge
perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to
worse </s>
<s> 

he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked
it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching
out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i aint a going
to be low dear boy </s>
<s> 

he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his
face and head and neck and hands before he could go on </s>
<s> 

i had said to compeyson that id smash that face of his and i swore
lord smash mine </s>
<s>  to do it </s>
<s>  we was in the same prisonship but i
couldnt get at him for long though i tried </s>
<s>  at last i come behind him
and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at
him when i was seen and seized </s>
<s>  the blackhole of that ship warnt
a strong one to a judge of blackholes that could swim and dive </s>
<s>  i
escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying
them as was in �em and all over when i first see my boy </s>
<s> 

he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent
to me again though i had felt great pity for him </s>
<s> 

by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marshes
too </s>
<s>  upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit
of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore </s>
<s>  i hunted him down </s>
<s>  i
smashed his face </s>
<s>  �and now says i �as the worst thing i can do caring
nothing for myself ill drag you back </s>

him by the hair if it had come to that and id a got him aboard
without the soldiers </s>

of course hed much the best of it to the lasthis character was so
good </s>

intentions </s>

to trial again and sent for life </s>

pips comrade being here </s>

he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took
his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his
buttonhole and slowly filled it and began to smoke </s>

softly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his eyes

chapter xliii

why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be
traced to estella </s>
<s>  why should i loiter on my road to compare the state
of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her at the coachoffice with the state of mind in which
i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty
and the returned transport whom i harbored </s>
<s>  the road would be none the
smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not
be helped nor i extenuated </s>
<s> 

a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative </s>
<s>  or rather
his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there </s>
<s>  if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could
hardly doubt the consequence </s>
<s>  that compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him neither of the two could know much better than i </s>
<s>  and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined </s>
<s> 

never had i breathed and never would i breatheor so i resolveda
word of estella to provis </s>
<s>  but i said to herbert that before i could
go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham </s>
<s>  this was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story </s>
<s>  i
resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went </s>
<s> 

on my presenting myself at <abvr> brandleys estellas maid was called to
tell that estella had gone into the country </s>
<s>  where </s>
<s>  to satis house as
usual </s>
<s>  not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without
me </s>
<s>  when was she coming back </s>
<s>  there was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid
believed she was only coming back at all for a little while </s>
<s>  i could
make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make
nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture </s>
<s> 

another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i
always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came
back from miss havishams </s>
<s>  in the mean time herbert and i were to
consider separately what it would be best to say </s>
<s>  whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
observation </s>
<s>  or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose
an expedition </s>
<s>  we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he
would consent </s>
<s>  we agreed that his remaining many days in his present
hazard was not to be thought of </s>
<s> 

next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise
to go down to joe </s>
<s>  but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe
or his name </s>
<s>  provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and
herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken </s>
<s>  i was to be
absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun </s>
<s>  it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to
herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that
pretenceas to make purchases or the like </s>
<s> 

having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havishams i set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and
whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist like a beggar </s>
<s>  when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly
ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand
to look at the coach but bentley drummle </s>
<s> 

as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him </s>
<s>  it was a very
lame pretence on both sides </s>
<s>  the lamer because we both went into the
coffeeroom where he had just finished his breakfast and where i
ordered mine </s>
<s>  it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very
well knew why he had come there </s>
<s> 

pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had
nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of
coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire </s>
<s>  by
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
fire </s>
<s>  and i got up determined to have my share of it </s>
<s>  i had to put my
hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire but still pretended not to know him </s>
<s> 

is this a cut </s>
<s>  said <abvr> drummle </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said i poker in hand </s>
<s>  its you is it </s>
<s>  how do you do </s>
<s>  i was
wondering who it was who kept the fire off </s>
<s> 

with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side
by side with <abvr> drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire </s>
<s> 

you have just come down </s>
<s>  said <abvr> drummle edging me a little away
with his shoulder </s>
<s> 

yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder </s>
<s> 

beastly place said drummle </s>
<s>  your part of the country i think </s>
<s> 

yes i assented </s>
<s>  i am told its very like your shropshire </s>
<s> 

not in the least like it said drummle </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then <abvr>
drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his </s>
<s> 

have you been here long </s>
<s>  i asked determined not to yield an inch of
the fire </s>
<s> 

long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn
but equally determined </s>
<s> 

do you stay here long </s>
<s> 

cant say answered <abvr> drummle </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

cant say said i </s>
<s> 

i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if <abvr> drummles
shoulder had claimed another hairs breadth of room i should have
jerked him into the window </s>
<s>  equally that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim <abvr> drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box </s>
<s>  he
whistled a little </s>
<s>  so did i </s>
<s> 

large tract of marshes about here i believe </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  what of that </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh </s>
<s>  and
laughed </s>
<s> 

are you amused <abvr> drummle </s>
<s> 

no said he not particularly </s>
<s>  i am going out for a ride in the
saddle </s>
<s>  i mean to explore those marshes for amusement </s>

wont do </s>
<s> 

very good sir </s>
<s> 

and i dont dine because im going to dine at the ladys </s>
<s> 

very good sir </s>
<s> 

then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his
greatjowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so
exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the
robber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat
him on the fire </s>
<s> 

one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief
came neither of us could relinquish the fire </s>
<s>  there we stood well
squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our
hands behind us not budging an inch </s>
<s>  the horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummles
was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both
stood our ground </s>
<s> 

have you been to the grove since </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was
there </s>
<s> 

was that when we had a difference of opinion </s>
<s> 

yes i replied very shortly </s>
<s> 

come come </s>

<s>  you
shouldnt have lost your temper </s>

mr </s>
<s>  drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that
subject </s>
<s>  when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that
occasion i dont throw glasses </s>
<s> 

i do said drummle </s>
<s> 

after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity i said

mr </s>
<s>  drummle i did not seek this conversation and i dont think it an
agreeable one </s>
<s> 

i am sure its not said he superciliously over his shoulder </s>
<s>  i
dont think anything about it </s>
<s> 

and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future </s>

chapter xliv

in the room where the dressingtable stood and where the waxcandles
burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella </s>
<s>  miss havisham
seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet </s>
<s> 
estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on </s>
<s>  they both raised
their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me </s>
<s>  i derived
that from the look they interchanged </s>
<s> 

and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip </s>
<s> 

though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused </s>
<s> 
estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and
then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as
plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i
had discovered my real benefactor </s>
<s> 

miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to
estella </s>
<s>  and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed </s>
<s> 

miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down
i took the chair by the dressingtable which i had often seen her
occupy </s>
<s>  with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural
place for me that day </s>
<s> 

what i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you
presentlyin a few moments </s>
<s>  it will not surprise you it will not
displease you </s>
<s>  i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be </s>
<s> 

miss havisham continued to look steadily at me </s>
<s>  i could see in the
action of estellas fingers as they worked that she attended to what i
said </s>
<s>  but she did not look up </s>
<s> 

i have found out who my patron is </s>
<s>  it is not a fortunate discovery
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune
anything </s>
<s>  there are reasons why i must say no more of that </s>
<s>  it is not my
secret but anothers </s>
<s> 

as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to
go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but anothers </s>
<s> 
well </s>
<s> 

when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i
belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left
i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have
comeas a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid
for it </s>
<s> 

ay pip replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head </s>
<s>  you did </s>
<s> 

and that <abvr> jaggers

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone had
nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it </s>

his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence </s>
<s>  he holds the same
relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise </s>
<s>  be that
as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one </s>
<s> 

any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far </s>
<s> 

but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least
you led me on </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on </s>
<s> 

was that kind </s>
<s> 

who am i cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor
and flashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in
surprisewho am i for gods sake that i should be kind </s>
<s> 

it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it </s>
<s>  i
told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst </s>
<s> 

well well well </s>

<s>  what else </s>
<s> 

i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe
her in being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for
my own information </s>

disinterested purpose </s>

history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
not to have it so </s>

<s> 

waiting until she was quiet againfor this too flashed out of her in
a wild and sudden wayi went on </s>
<s> 

i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham
and have been constantly among them since i went to london </s>
<s>  i know them
to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself </s>
<s>  and i should be
false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or
no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you
deeply wrong both <abvr> matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of
anything designing or mean </s>
<s> 

they are your friends said miss havisham </s>
<s> 

they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me
to have superseded them </s>
<s>  and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and
mistress camilla were not my friends i think </s>
<s> 

this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do
them good with her </s>
<s>  she looked at me keenly for a little while and then
said quietly

what do you want for them </s>
<s> 

only said i that you would not confound them with the others </s>
<s>  they
may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same
nature </s>
<s> 

still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated

what do you want for them </s>
<s> 

i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i
reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired
that i do want something </s>
<s>  miss havisham if you would spare the money
to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you
how </s>
<s> 

why must it be done without his knowledge </s>
<s>  she asked settling her
hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively </s>
<s> 

because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago
without his knowledge and i dont want to be betrayed </s>
<s>  why i fail in my
ability to finish it i cannot explain </s>
<s>  it is a part of the secret which
is another persons and not mine </s>
<s> 

she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire </s>
<s> 
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me againat
first vacantlythen with a gradually concentrating attention </s>
<s>  all
this time estella knitted on </s>
<s>  when miss havisham had fixed her
attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue

what else </s>
<s> 

estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my
trembling voice you know i love you </s>
<s>  you know that i have loved you
long and dearly </s>
<s> 

she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers
plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance </s>
<s>  i
saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me </s>
<s> 

i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake </s>
<s>  it induced me
to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another </s>
<s>  while i thought you
could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it </s>
<s>  but i
must say it now </s>
<s> 

preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going
estella shook her head </s>
<s> 

i know said i in answer to that actioni know </s>
<s>  i have no hope
that i shall ever call you mine estella </s>
<s>  i am ignorant what may become
of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go </s>
<s>  still i love
you </s>
<s>  i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house </s>
<s> 

looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her
head again </s>
<s> 

it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the
gravity of what she did </s>
<s>  but i think she did not </s>
<s>  i think that in the
endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella </s>
<s> 

i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she
sat looking by turns at estella and at me </s>
<s> 

it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments
fanciesi dont know how to call themwhich i am not able to
comprehend </s>
<s>  when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form
of words </s>
<s>  but nothing more </s>
<s>  you address nothing in my breast you touch
nothing there </s>
<s>  i dont care for what you say at all </s>
<s>  i have tried to
warn you of this </s>
<s>  now have i not </s>
<s> 

i said in a miserable manner yes </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it </s>
<s> 
now did you not think so </s>
<s> 

i thought and hoped you could not mean it </s>
<s>  you so young untried and
beautiful estella </s>
<s>  surely it is not in nature </s>
<s> 

it is in my nature she returned </s>
<s>  and then she added with a stress
upon the words it is in the nature formed within me </s>
<s>  i make a great
difference between you and all other people when i say so much </s>
<s>  i can do
no more </s>
<s> 

is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and
pursuing you </s>
<s> 

it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference
of utter contempt </s>
<s> 

that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with
you this very day </s>
<s> 

she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied
quite true </s>
<s> 

you cannot love him estella </s>
<s> 

her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily
what have i told you </s>
<s>  do you still think in spite of it that i do not
mean what i say </s>
<s> 

you would never marry him estella </s>
<s> 

she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands </s>
<s>  then she said why not tell you the truth </s>
<s>  i am
going to be married to him </s>
<s> 

i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better
than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear
her say those words </s>
<s>  when i raised my face again there was such a
ghastly look upon miss havishams that it impressed me even in my
passionate hurry and grief </s>
<s> 

estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this
fatal step </s>
<s>  put me aside for everyou have done so i well knowbut
bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle </s>
<s>  miss havisham
gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
to the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly
love you </s>
<s>  among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly
though he has not loved you as long as i </s>
<s>  take him and i can bear it
better for your sake </s>
<s> 

my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her own mind </s>
<s> 

i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to
him </s>
<s>  the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be
married soon </s>
<s>  why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
adoption </s>
<s>  it is my own act </s>
<s> 

your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute </s>
<s> 

on whom should i fling myself away </s>
<s>  she retorted with a smile </s>

people do feel such things that i took nothing to him </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>  it is
done </s>
<s>  i shall do well enough and so will my husband </s>

me into what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me

more </s>
<s>  we shall never understand each other </s>

in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i
dont know </s>
<s>  the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an
inward wound and gushed out </s>
<s>  i held her hand to my lips some lingering
moments and so i left her </s>
<s>  but ever afterwards i rememberedand soon
afterwards with stronger reasonthat while estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand
still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse </s>
<s> 

all done all gone </s>
<s>  so much was done and gone that when i went out at
the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when i went
in </s>
<s>  for a while i hid myself among some lanes and bypaths and then
struck off to walk all the way to london </s>
<s>  for i had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and
see drummle there </s>
<s>  that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to </s>
<s>  that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out </s>

intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was
close by the riverside through whitefriars </s>

tomorrow </s>

get to bed myself without disturbing him </s>
<s> 

as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the
temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it
ill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in </s>

my name </s>

lantern </s>

much surprised by the request i took the note </s>

chapter xlv

turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made
the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the hummums in covent garden </s>
<s>  in those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain
letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on
his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his
list </s>
<s>  it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a
despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it straddling over the
whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little
washingstand in quite a divinely righteous manner </s>
<s> 

as i had asked for a nightlight the chamberlain had brought me in
before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous daysan object like the ghost of a walkingcane which
instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be
lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wideawake pattern on the walls </s>
<s>  when i had got into bed and lay there
footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own
eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus </s>
<s>  and thus in the
gloom and death of the night we stared at one another </s>
<s> 

what a doleful night </s>
<s>  how anxious how dismal how long </s>
<s>  there was an
inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust </s>
<s>  and as i
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what
a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the
market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying
by for next summer </s>
<s>  this led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my facea
disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back </s>
<s>  when i had lain awake a little while those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible </s>
<s>  the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little
washingstand ticked and one guitarstring played occasionally in the
chest of drawers </s>
<s>  at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw
written dont go home </s>
<s> 

whatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me they never warded
off this dont go home </s>
<s>  it plaited itself into whatever i thought of
as a bodily pain would have done </s>
<s>  not long before i had read in the
newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the
night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood </s>
<s>  it came into my head that he
must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about </s>
<s>  then opened the door
to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing </s>
<s>  but
all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home
and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were
questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme </s>
<s>  even when i
thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when
i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and
tones and the action of her fingers while she knittedeven then i
was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution dont go home </s>
<s> 
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became
a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate </s>
<s>  imperative mood present
tense </s>
<s>  do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do
not ye or you go home let not them go home </s>
<s>  then potentially </s>
<s>  i may not
and i cannot go home </s>
<s>  and i might not could not would not and should
not go home </s>
<s>  until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over
on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again </s>
<s> 

i had left directions that i was to be called at seven </s>
<s>  for it was plain
that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain
that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be
taken </s>
<s>  it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed </s>
<s> 

the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oclock </s>
<s>  the little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company
and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was
making tea for himself and the aged </s>
<s>  an open door afforded a perspective
view of the aged in bed </s>
<s> 

halloa <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  you did come home then </s>
<s> 

yes i returned </s>
<s>  but i didnt go home </s>

thats all right said he rubbing his hands </s>
<s>  i left a note for you
at each of the temple gates on the chance </s>
<s>  which gate did you come to </s>
<s> 

i told him </s>
<s> 

ill go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes said wemmick </s>
<s>  its a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it because you dont know when it may be put
in </s>
<s>  im going to take a liberty with you </s>
<s>  would you mind toasting this
sausage for the aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

i said i should be delighted to do it </s>
<s> 

then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little
servant </s>
<s>  which leaves us to ourselves dont you see <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  he
added winking as she disappeared </s>
<s> 

i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the ageds sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the ageds roll </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one
another </s>
<s>  we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before today </s>
<s>  official sentiments
are one thing </s>
<s>  we are extra official </s>
<s> 

i cordially assented </s>
<s>  i was so very nervous that i had already lighted
the ageds sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out </s>
<s> 

i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a
certain place where i once took youeven between you and me its as
well not to mention names when avoidable

much better not said i </s>
<s>  i understand you </s>
<s> 

i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not
unpossessed of portable propertyi dont know who it may really
bewe wont name this person

not necessary said i </s>
<s> 

had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations
and not quite irrespective of the government expense

in watching his face i made quite a firework of the ageds sausage
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmicks </s>
<s>  for which i
apologized </s>
<s> 

by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of
thereabouts </s>
<s>  from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and
theories formed </s>
<s>  i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court
temple had been watched and might be watched again </s>
<s> 

by whom </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

i wouldnt go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with
official responsibilities </s>
<s>  i heard it as i have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place </s>
<s>  i dont tell it you on information
received </s>
<s>  i heard it </s>
<s> 

he took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth
the ageds breakfast neatly on a little tray </s>
<s>  previous to placing it
before him he went into the ageds room with a clean white cloth and
tied the same under the old gentlemans chin and propped him up and
put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air </s>
<s>  then he
placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right
aint you aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  to which the cheerful aged replied all right
john my boy all right </s>
<s>  as there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be
considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings </s>
<s> 

this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to
suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted </s>
<s>  is it </s>
<s> 

wemmick looked very serious </s>
<s>  i couldnt undertake to say that of my
own knowledge </s>
<s>  i mean i couldnt undertake to say it was at first </s>
<s>  but
it either is or it will be or its in great danger of being </s>
<s> 

as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying
as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him </s>
<s>  but i told
him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask
him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he
deemed right and sure that his course would be right </s>
<s>  he paused in his
breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirtsleeves his
notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me
once to put my question </s>

compeyson </s>

he answered with one other nod </s>

one other nod </s>

is he in london </s>

he gave me one other nod compressed the postoffice exceedingly gave
me one last nod and went on with his breakfast </s>
<s> 

now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasized and
repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i
heard </s>
<s>  i went to garden court to find you </s>
<s>  not finding you i went to
clarrikers to find <abvr> herbert </s>

<s>  said i with great anxiety </s>
<s> 

and him i found </s>
<s>  without mentioning any names or going into any
details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodytom
jack or richardbeing about the chambers or about the immediate
neighborhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way
while you were out of the way </s>
<s> 

he would be greatly puzzled what to do </s>
<s> 

he was puzzled what to do </s>
<s>  not the less because i gave him my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out
of the way at present </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip ill tell you something </s>
<s>  under existing
circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it </s>
<s>  dont break cover too soon </s>
<s>  lie close </s>
<s>  wait till things slacken
before you try the open even for foreign air </s>
<s> 

i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had
done </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an
hour struck out a plan </s>
<s>  he mentioned to me as a secret that he is
courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden
pa </s>
<s>  which pa having been in the purser line of life lies abed in a
bowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river </s>
<s>  you
are acquainted with the young lady most probably </s>
<s> 

not personally said i </s>
<s> 

the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to
present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made
her acquaintance </s>
<s>  when i had begun to advance herberts prospects by
stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy </s>
<s>  he and
his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews </s>
<s>  and thus although i was
assured that i had risen in claras esteem and although the young
lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
herbert i had never seen her </s>
<s>  however i did not trouble wemmick with
these particulars </s>
<s> 

the house with the bowwindow said wemmick being by the riverside
down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it
seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let <abvr> herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary
tenement for tom jack or richard </s>
<s>  now i thought very well of it for
three reasons ill give you </s>
<s>  that is to say </s>
<s>  firstly </s>
<s>  its altogether
out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small </s>
<s>  secondly </s>
<s>  without going near it yourself you could
always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through <abvr> herbert </s>
<s> 
thirdly </s>
<s>  after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want
to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packetboat there he
isready </s>
<s> 

much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and
again and begged him to proceed </s>
<s> 

well sir </s>
<s>  <abvr> herbert threw himself into the business with a will and
by nine oclock last night he housed tom jack or richardwhichever
it may beyou and i dont want to knowquite successfully </s>
<s>  at the
old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in
fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it </s>
<s>  now
another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you
and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged </s>
<s> 
this diverts suspicion and confuses it </s>
<s>  and for the same reason i
recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go
home </s>
<s>  it brings in more confusion and you want confusion </s>
<s> 

wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and
began to get his coat on </s>
<s> 

and now <abvr> pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i
have probably done the most i can do </s>
<s>  but if i can ever do morefrom
a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal
capacityi shall be glad to do it </s>
<s>  heres the address </s>
<s>  there can be
no harm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is
well with tom jack or richard before you go homewhich is another
reason for your not going home last night </s>
<s>  but after you have gone
home dont go back here </s>
<s>  you are very welcome i am sure <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  his
hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them </s>
<s>  and let me
finally impress one important point upon you </s>
<s>  he laid his hands upon
my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper </s>
<s>  avail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his portable property </s>
<s>  you dont know what may
happen to him </s>
<s>  dont let anything happen to the portable property </s>
<s> 

quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i
forbore to try </s>
<s> 

times up said wemmick and i must be off </s>
<s>  if you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark thats what i should advise </s>
<s> 
you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the agedhell be up presentlyand a little bit
ofyou remember the pig </s>
<s> 

of course said i </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  and a little bit of him </s>
<s>  that sausage you toasted was his and
he was in all respects a firstrater </s>
<s>  do try him if it is only for old
acquaintance sake </s>
<s>  goodbye aged parent </s>
<s>  in a cheery shout </s>
<s> 

all right john </s>
<s>  all right my boy </s>
<s>  piped the old man from within </s>
<s> 

i soon fell asleep before wemmicks fire and the aged and i enjoyed one
anothers society by falling asleep before it more or less all day </s>
<s> 
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate </s>
<s>  and
i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it
drowsily </s>
<s>  when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for
toast </s>
<s>  and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his
glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was
expected </s>

chapter xlvi

eight oclock had struck before i got into the air that was scented
not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the longshore
boatbuilders and mast oar and block makers </s>
<s>  all that waterside
region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to
me </s>
<s>  and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted
was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to
find </s>
<s>  it was called mill pond bank chinkss basin </s>
<s>  and i had no other
guide to chinkss basin than the old green copper ropewalk </s>
<s> 

it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself
among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of shipbuilders
and shipbreakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground
though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber how many ropewalks that were not the old green copper </s>
<s>  after
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank </s>
<s>  it was a
fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round </s>
<s>  and there were two or three
trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there
was the old green copper ropewalkwhose long and narrow vista i could
trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground that looked like superannuated haymakingrakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth </s>
<s> 

selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow which is
another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there
mrs </s>
<s>  whimple </s>
<s>  that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded </s>
<s>  she was
immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door </s>
<s>  it was an odd sensation to see his very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region </s>
<s>  and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at
the cornercupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the
chimneypiece and the colored engravings on the wall representing the
death of captain cook a shiplaunch and his majesty king george the
third in a state coachmans wig leatherbreeches and topboots on the
terrace at windsor </s>
<s> 

all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though
eager to see you </s>
<s>  my dear girl is with her father </s>
<s>  and if youll wait
till she comes down ill make you known to her and then well go upstairs </s>
<s> 
thats her father </s>
<s> 

i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance </s>
<s> 

i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have
never seen him </s>
<s>  dont you smell rum </s>
<s>  he is always at it </s>
<s> 

at rum </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his
gout </s>
<s>  he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his
room and serving them out </s>
<s>  he keeps them on shelves over his head and
will weigh them all </s>
<s>  his room must be like a chandlers shop </s>
<s> 

while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and
then died away </s>
<s> 

what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if
he will cut the cheese </s>
<s>  a man with the gout in his right handand
everywhere elsecant expect to get through a double gloucester without
hurting himself </s>
<s> 

he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious
roar </s>
<s> 

to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to <abvr> whimple
 said herbert for of course people in general wont stand that noise </s>
<s>  a
curious place handel </s>
<s>  isnt it </s>
<s> 

it was a curious place indeed </s>
<s>  but remarkably well kept and clean </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of
housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without
her motherly help </s>
<s>  for clara has no mother of her own handel and no
relation in the world but old gruffandgrim </s>
<s> 

surely thats not his name herbert </s>
<s> 

no no said herbert thats my name for him </s>
<s>  his name is <abvr> barley </s>
<s> 
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her family </s>
<s> 

herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he
first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at
an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home
to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the
motherly <abvr> whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion ever since </s>
<s>  it was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by
reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than gout rum and pursers stores </s>
<s> 

as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barleys sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door
opened and a very pretty slight darkeyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her hand </s>
<s>  whom herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket and presented blushing as clara </s>
<s>  she really was a most
charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that
truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service </s>
<s> 

look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate
and tender smile after we had talked a little </s>
<s>  heres poor claras
supper served out every night </s>
<s>  heres her allowance of bread and
heres her slice of cheese and heres her rumwhich i drink </s>
<s>  this
is <abvr> barleys breakfast for tomorrow served out to be cooked </s>
<s>  two
muttonchops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two
ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper </s>
<s>  its
stewed up together and taken hot and its a nice thing for the gout i
should think </s>
<s> 

there was something so natural and winning in claras resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out </s>
<s>  and
something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of
yielding herself to herberts embracing arm </s>
<s>  and something so gentle in
her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinkss basin
and the old green copper ropewalk with old barley growling in the
beamthat i would not have undone the engagement between her and
herbert for all the money in the pocketbook i had never opened </s>
<s> 

i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us </s>
<s>  upon this clara said to herbert papa wants
me darling </s>
<s>  and ran away </s>
<s> 

there is an unconscionable old shark for you </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  what do
you suppose he wants now handel </s>
<s> 

i dont know said i </s>
<s>  something to drink </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary
merit </s>
<s>  he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table </s>
<s> 
wait a moment and youll hear clara lift him up to take some </s>
<s>  there
he goes </s>
<s>  another roar with a prolonged shake at the end </s>
<s>  now said
herbert as it was succeeded by silence hes drinking </s>
<s>  now said
herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more hes down again
on his back </s>
<s> 

clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to
see our charge </s>
<s>  as we passed <abvr> barleys door he was heard hoarsely
muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the
following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse </s>
<s> 

ahoy </s>
<s>  bless your eyes heres old bill barley </s>
<s>  heres old bill barley
bless your eyes </s>
<s>  heres old bill barley on the flat of his back by the
lord </s>
<s>  lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder
heres your old bill barley bless your eyes </s>
<s>  ahoy </s>
<s>  bless you </s>
<s> 

in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together </s>
<s>  often while
it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river </s>
<s> 

in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and
airy and in which <abvr> barley was less audible than below i found
provis comfortably settled </s>
<s>  he expressed no alarm and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning </s>
<s>  but it struck me that he was
softenedindefinably for i could not have said how and could never
afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly </s>
<s> 

the opportunity that the days rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting
compeyson </s>
<s>  for anything i knew his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction </s>
<s>  therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his
fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmicks judgment
and sources of information </s>
<s> 

ay ay dear boy </s>
<s>  he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows </s>
<s> 

then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you
what caution he gave me and what advice </s>
<s> 

this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned </s>
<s>  and i told
him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or
prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that
my chambers had been watched </s>
<s>  how wemmick had recommended his keeping
close for a time and my keeping away from him </s>
<s>  and what wemmick had
said about getting him abroad </s>
<s>  i added that of course when the time
came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might
be safest in wemmicks judgment </s>
<s>  what was to follow that i did not touch
upon </s>
<s>  neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared
peril for my sake </s>
<s>  as to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse </s>
<s> 

he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout </s>
<s>  his
coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a
venture </s>
<s>  he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had
very little fear of his safety with such good help </s>
<s> 

herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmicks
suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue </s>
<s>  we are both good
watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the
right time comes </s>
<s>  no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no
boatmen </s>
<s>  that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance
is worth saving </s>
<s>  never mind the season </s>
<s>  dont you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river </s>
<s>  you fall into that
habit and then who notices or minds </s>
<s>  do it twenty or fifty times
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twentyfirst or
fiftyfirst </s>
<s> 

i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it </s>
<s>  we agreed
that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never
recognize us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank </s>
<s>  but
we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his
window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right </s>
<s> 

our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go </s>
<s> 
remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and
that i would take half an hours start of him </s>
<s>  i dont like to leave
you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s> 

dear boy he answered clasping my hands i dont know when we may
meet again and i dont like goodbye </s>
<s>  say good night </s>
<s> 

good night </s>
<s>  herbert will go regularly between us and when the time
comes you may be certain i shall be ready </s>
<s>  good night good night </s>
<s> 

we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms </s>
<s>  and we left him
on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stairrail to
light us downstairs </s>
<s>  looking back at him i thought of the first night
of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him
as it was now </s>
<s> 

old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease </s>
<s>  when we got to the
foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of
provis </s>
<s>  he replied certainly not and that the lodger was <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 
he also explained that the utmost known of <abvr> campbell there was
that he herbert had <abvr> campbell consigned to him and felt a strong
personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded
life </s>
<s>  so when we went into the parlor where <abvr> whimple and clara were
seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in <abvr> campbell but
kept it to myself </s>
<s> 

when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle darkeyed girl and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk had
grown quite a different place </s>
<s>  old barley might be as old as the hills
and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in chinkss basin to fill it to
overflowing </s>
<s>  and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went
home very sadly </s>
<s> 

all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them </s>
<s>  the
windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark
and still and there was no lounger in garden court </s>
<s>  i walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms but i was quite alone </s>
<s>  herbert coming to my
bedside when he came infor i went straight to bed dispirited and
fatiguedmade the same report </s>
<s>  opening one of the windows after that
he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour </s>
<s> 

next day i set myself to get the boat </s>
<s>  it was soon done and the boat
was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach
her within a minute or two </s>
<s>  then i began to go out as for training and
practice </s>
<s>  sometimes alone sometimes with herbert </s>
<s>  i was often out in
cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been
out a few times </s>
<s>  at first i kept above blackfriars bridge </s>
<s>  but as the
hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge </s>
<s>  it was old
london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation </s>
<s>  but i
knew well enough how to �shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so
began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith </s>
<s> 
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a
pair of oars </s>
<s>  and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards
the east come down </s>
<s>  herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming </s>
<s>  still i knew that there was cause for alarm
and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched </s>
<s>  once received
it is a haunting idea </s>
<s>  how many undesigning persons i suspected of
watching me it would be hard to calculate </s>
<s> 

in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding </s>
<s> 
herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to
think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara </s>
<s>  but
i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly
silently and surely to take him </s>
<s> 




chapter xlvii

some weeks passed without bringing any change </s>
<s>  we waited for wemmick
and he made no sign </s>
<s>  if i had never known him out of little britain and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
castle i might have doubted him </s>
<s>  not so for a moment knowing him as i
did </s>
<s> 

my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed
for money by more than one creditor </s>
<s>  even i myself began to know the
want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash </s>
<s>  but
i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans </s>
<s>  therefore i had sent him the unopened pocketbook by herbert to
hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it
was a false kind or a true i hardly knowin not having profited by his
generosity since his revelation of himself </s>
<s> 

as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella
was married </s>
<s>  fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a
conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had
confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her
to me </s>
<s>  why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know </s>
<s>  why did you
who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year last month last week </s>
<s> 

it was an unhappy life that i lived </s>
<s>  and its one dominant anxiety
towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a
range of mountains never disappeared from my view </s>
<s>  still no new cause
for fear arose </s>
<s>  let me start from my bed as i would with the terror
fresh upon me that he was discovered </s>
<s>  let me sit listening as i would
with dread for herberts returning step at night lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil newsfor all that and
much more to like purpose the round of things went on </s>
<s>  condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed
about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could </s>
<s> 

there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could
not get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old london
bridge </s>
<s>  then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be
brought up afterwards to the temple stairs </s>
<s>  i was not averse to doing
this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
waterside people there </s>
<s>  from this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that i have now to tell of </s>
<s> 

one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf
at dusk </s>
<s>  i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and
had turned with the tide </s>
<s>  it had been a fine bright day but had become
foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the
shipping pretty carefully </s>
<s>  both in going and returning i had seen the
signal in his window all well </s>
<s> 

as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort
myself with dinner at once </s>
<s>  and as i had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go
to the play </s>
<s>  the theatre where <abvr> wopsle had achieved his questionable
triumph was in that waterside neighborhood it is nowhere now and
to that theatre i resolved to go </s>
<s>  i was aware that <abvr> wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather
partaken of its decline </s>
<s>  he had been ominously heard of through the
playbills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of
noble birth and a monkey </s>
<s>  and herbert had seen him as a predatory
tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an
outrageous hat all over bells </s>
<s> 

i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chophouse
where there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every halfyard
of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knivesto
this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the lord mayors
dominions which is not geographicaland wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners </s>
<s>  by
and by i roused myself and went to the play </s>
<s> 

there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majestys servicea most
excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so
tight in some places and not quite so loose in otherswho knocked all
the little mens hats over their eyes though he was very generous and
brave and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes though he was
very patriotic </s>
<s>  he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in
the cloth and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture
with great rejoicings </s>
<s>  the whole population of portsmouth nine in
number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody elses and sing fill fill </s>
<s>  a certain
darkcomplexioned swab however who wouldnt fill or do anything else
that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the
boatswain to be as black as his figurehead proposed to two other
swabs to get all mankind into difficulties </s>
<s>  which was so effectually
done the swab family having considerable political influence that it
took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters
and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and
coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard </s>
<s>  this led to <abvr>
wopsles who had never been heard of before coming in with a star
and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot
and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight
acknowledgment of his public services </s>
<s>  the boatswain unmanned for the
first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering
up and addressing <abvr> wopsle as your honor solicited permission to
take him by the fin </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious
dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody
danced a hornpipe </s>
<s>  and from that corner surveying the public with a
discontented eye became aware of me </s>

the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in
the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected
mr </s>
<s>  wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great
cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner </s>
<s> 
but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances </s>
<s>  for
the genius of youthful love being in want of assistanceon account of
the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice
of his daughters heart by purposely falling upon the object in a
floursack out of the firstfloor windowsummoned a sententious
enchanter </s>
<s>  and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after
an apparently violent journey proved to be <abvr> wopsle in a highcrowned
hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm </s>
<s>  the business
of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at
butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colors
he had a good deal of time on his hands </s>
<s>  and i observed with great
surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were
lost in amazement </s>
<s> 

there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of <abvr>
wopsles eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out </s>
<s>  i sat
thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
watchcase and still i could not make it out </s>
<s>  i was still thinking
of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him
waiting for me near the door </s>
<s> 

how do you do </s>
<s>  said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the
street together </s>
<s>  i saw that you saw me </s>
<s> 

saw you <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  he returned </s>
<s>  yes of course i saw you </s>
<s>  but who else
was there </s>
<s> 

who else </s>
<s> 

it is the strangest thing said <abvr> wopsle drifting into his lost
look again </s>
<s>  and yet i could swear to him </s>
<s> 

becoming alarmed i entreated <abvr> wopsle to explain his meaning </s>
<s> 

whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there
 said <abvr> wopsle going on in the same lost way i cant be positive </s>
<s> 
yet i think i should </s>
<s> 

involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me
when i went home </s>
<s>  for these mysterious words gave me a chill </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he cant be in sight said <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s>  he went out before i went
off </s>
<s>  i saw him go </s>
<s> 

having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected
this poor actor </s>
<s>  i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission </s>
<s> 
therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing </s>
<s> 

i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you <abvr> pip till i saw
that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a
ghost </s>
<s> 

my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak
yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with provis </s>
<s>  of course i was
perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there </s>
<s> 

i dare say you wonder at me <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  indeed i see you do </s>
<s>  but it is
so very strange </s>
<s>  youll hardly believe what i am going to tell you </s>
<s>  i
could hardly believe it myself if you told me </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

no indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip you remember in old times a certain christmas day
when you were quite a child and i dined at gargerys and some soldiers
came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended </s>
<s> 

i remember it very well </s>
<s> 

and you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we
joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took the
lead and you kept up with me as well as you could </s>
<s> 

i remember it all very well </s>
<s>  better than he thoughtexcept the last
clause </s>
<s> 

and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that
there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other </s>
<s> 

i see it all before me </s>
<s> 

and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre
and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes
with the torchlight shining on their facesi am particular about
thatwith the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an
outer ring of dark night all about us </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s>  i remember all that </s>
<s> 

then <abvr> pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight </s>
<s>  i saw
him over your shoulder </s>
<s> 

steady </s>
<s>  i thought </s>
<s>  i asked him then which of the two do you suppose
you saw </s>
<s> 

the one who had been mauled he answered readily and ill swear i
saw him </s>
<s>  the more i think of him the more certain i am of him </s>
<s> 

this is very curious </s>
<s>  said i with the best assumption i could put on
of its being nothing more to me </s>
<s>  very curious indeed </s>
<s> 

i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeysons
having been behind me like a ghost </s>
<s>  for if he had ever been out of my
thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was
in those very moments when he was closest to me </s>
<s>  and to think that i
should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if
i had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had
found him at my elbow </s>
<s>  i could not doubt either that he was there
because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger
there might be about us danger was always near and active </s>
<s> 

i put such questions to <abvr> wopsle as when did the man come in </s>
<s>  he
could not tell me that </s>
<s>  he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man </s>
<s> 
it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify
him </s>
<s>  but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and
known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time </s>
<s>  how was
he dressed </s>
<s>  prosperously but not noticeably otherwise </s>
<s>  he thought in
black </s>
<s>  was his face at all disfigured </s>
<s>  no he believed not </s>
<s>  i believed
not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention </s>
<s> 

when <abvr> wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i
extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment
after the fatigues of the evening we parted </s>
<s>  it was between twelve and
one oclock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut </s>
<s>  no one
was near me when i went in and went home </s>
<s> 

herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire </s>
<s>  but
there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i
had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint </s>
<s> 
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the
castle i made this communication by letter </s>
<s>  i wrote it before i went to
bed and went out and posted it </s>
<s>  and again no one was near me </s>
<s>  herbert
and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious </s>
<s>  and
we were very cautious indeedmore cautious than before if that were
possibleand i for my part never went near chinkss basin except
when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at
anything else </s>

chapter xlviii

the second of the two meetings referred to in the last </s>
<s> occurred
about a week after the first </s>
<s>  i had again left my boat at the wharf
below bridge </s>
<s>  the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon </s>
<s>  and
undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was
strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me </s>
<s>  it was <abvr> jaggerss hand and he passed it through my
arm </s>
<s> 

as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together </s>
<s>  where
are you bound for </s>
<s> 

for the temple i think said i </s>
<s> 

dont you know </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in
crossexamination i do not know for i have not made up my mind </s>
<s> 

you are going to dine </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  you dont mind admitting
that i suppose </s>
<s> 

no i returned i dont mind admitting that </s>
<s> 

and are not engaged </s>
<s> 

i dont mind admitting also that i am not engaged </s>
<s> 

then said <abvr> jaggers come and dine with me </s>
<s> 

i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmicks coming </s>
<s>  so
i changed my excuse into an acceptancethe few words i had uttered
serving for the beginning of eitherand we went along cheapside
and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamplighters scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoons bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall </s>
<s> 

at the office in little britain there was the usual letterwriting
handwashing candlesnuffing and safelocking that closed the
business of the day </s>
<s>  as i stood idle by <abvr> jaggerss fire its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bopeep with me </s>
<s>  while the pair of coarse
fat office candles that dimly lighted <abvr> jaggers as he wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty windingsheets as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients </s>
<s> 

we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackneycoach </s>
<s>  and
as soon as we got there dinner was served </s>
<s>  although i should not have
thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much
as a look to wemmicks walworth sentiments yet i should have had no
objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way </s>
<s>  but it
was not to be done </s>
<s>  he turned his eyes on <abvr> jaggers whenever he raised
them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one </s>
<s> 

did you send that note of miss havishams to <abvr> pip wemmick </s>
<s>  <abvr>
jaggers asked soon after we began dinner </s>
<s> 

no sir returned wemmick </s>
<s>  it was going by post when you brought <abvr>
pip into the office </s>
<s>  here it is </s>
<s>  he handed it to his principal instead
of to me </s>
<s> 

its a note of two lines pip said <abvr> jaggers handing it on sent
up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address </s>
<s>  she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her </s>
<s>  youll go down </s>
<s> 

yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those
terms </s>
<s> 

when do you think of going down </s>
<s> 

i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was
putting fish into the postoffice that renders me rather uncertain of
my time </s>
<s>  at once i think </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to <abvr>
jaggers he neednt write an answer you know </s>
<s> 

receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled
that i would go tomorrow and said so </s>
<s>  wemmick drank a glass of wine
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at <abvr> jaggers but not at me </s>
<s> 

so pip </s>
<s>  our friend the spider said <abvr> jaggers has played his
cards </s>
<s>  he has won the pool </s>
<s> 

it was as much as i could do to assent </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  he is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all
his own way </s>
<s>  the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to
be found out first </s>
<s>  if he should turn to and beat her

surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i didnt say so pip </s>
<s>  i am putting a case </s>
<s>  if he should turn to and
beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side </s>
<s>  if it should be
a question of intellect he certainly will not </s>
<s>  it would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances because its a tossup between two results </s>
<s> 

may i ask what they are </s>
<s> 

a fellow like our friend the spider answered <abvr> jaggers either
beats or cringes </s>
<s>  he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl </s>
<s>  but
he either beats or cringes </s>
<s>  ask wemmick his opinion </s>
<s> 

either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself
to me </s>
<s> 

so heres to <abvr> bentley drummle said <abvr> jaggers taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter and filling for each of us and
for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the ladys
satisfaction </s>
<s>  to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman
it never will be </s>
<s>  now molly molly molly molly how slow you are
today </s>
<s> 

she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the
table </s>
<s>  as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two
nervously muttering some excuse </s>
<s>  and a certain action of her fingers as
she spoke arrested my attention </s>
<s> 

whats the matter </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather
painful to me </s>
<s> 

the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting </s>
<s>  she stood
looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or
whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go </s>
<s> 
her look was very intent </s>
<s>  surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately </s>
<s> 

he dismissed her and she glided out of the room </s>
<s>  but she remained
before me as plainly as if she were still there </s>
<s>  i looked at those
hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair </s>
<s>  and i
compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life </s>
<s>  i looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when i last walkednot alonein the ruined garden and through the
deserted brewery </s>
<s>  i thought how the same feeling had come back when i
saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach
window </s>
<s>  and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning when i had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden
glare of light in a dark street </s>
<s>  i thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link
wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a
chance swift from estellas name to the fingers with their knitting
action and the attentive eyes </s>
<s>  and i felt absolutely certain that this
woman was estellas mother </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal </s>
<s>  he nodded when i said
the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the
wine again and went on with his dinner </s>
<s> 

only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the
room was very short and <abvr> jaggers was sharp with her </s>
<s>  but her hands
were estellas hands and her eyes were estellas eyes and if she had
reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth </s>
<s> 

it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round
quite as a matter of businessjust as he might have drawn his salary
when that came roundand with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for crossexamination </s>
<s>  as to the quantity of wine
his postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice
for its quantity of letters </s>
<s>  from my point of view he was the wrong
twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth </s>
<s> 

we took our leave early and left together </s>
<s>  even when we were groping
among <abvr> jaggerss stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right
twin was on his way back </s>
<s>  and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was
walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said wemmick thats over </s>
<s>  hes a wonderful man without his
living likeness </s>
<s>  but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine
with himand i dine more comfortably unscrewed </s>
<s> 

i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so </s>
<s> 

wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself he answered </s>
<s>  i know that
what is said between you and me goes no further </s>
<s> 

i asked him if he had ever seen miss havishams adopted daughter <abvr>
bentley drummle </s>
<s>  he said no </s>
<s>  to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke
of the aged and of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  he looked rather sly when i mentioned
miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll
of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness </s>
<s> 

wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to
mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss private house to notice that housekeeper </s>
<s> 

did i </s>
<s>  he replied </s>
<s>  ah i dare say i did </s>
<s>  deuce take me he added
suddenly i know i did </s>
<s>  i find i am not quite unscrewed yet </s>
<s> 

a wild beast tamed you called her </s>
<s> 

and what do you call her </s>
<s> 

the same </s>
<s>  how did <abvr> jaggers tame her wemmick </s>
<s> 

thats his secret </s>
<s>  she has been with him many a long year </s>
<s> 

i wish you would tell me her story </s>
<s>  i feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it </s>
<s>  you know that what is said between you and me
goes no further </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  wemmick replied i dont know her storythat is i dont know
all of it </s>
<s>  but what i do know ill tell you </s>
<s>  we are in our private and
personal capacities of course </s>
<s> 

of course </s>
<s> 

a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for
murder and was acquitted </s>
<s>  she was a very handsome young woman and i
believe had some gypsy blood in her </s>
<s>  anyhow it was hot enough when it
was up as you may suppose </s>
<s> 

but she was acquitted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning
and worked the case in a way quite astonishing </s>
<s>  it was a desperate
case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked
it to general admiration </s>
<s>  in fact it may almost be said to have made
him </s>
<s>  he worked it himself at the policeoffice day after day for many
days contending against even a committal </s>
<s>  and at the trial where he
couldnt work it himself sat under counsel andevery one knewput
in all the salt and pepper </s>
<s>  the murdered person was a womana woman a
good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger </s>
<s>  it was
a case of jealousy </s>
<s>  they both led tramping lives and this woman in
gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as
we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy </s>
<s> 
the murdered womanmore a match for the man certainly in point of
yearswas found dead in a barn near hounslow heath </s>
<s>  there had been a
violent struggle perhaps a fight </s>
<s>  she was bruised and scratched and
torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked </s>
<s>  now there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and
on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it <abvr> jaggers
principally rested his case </s>
<s>  you may be sure said wemmick touching me
on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then
though he sometimes does now </s>
<s> 

i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner
party </s>
<s> 

well sir </s>
<s>  wemmick went on </s>
<s>  it happenedhappened dont you
see </s>
<s> that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was </s>
<s>  in
particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look </s>
<s>  she had only a bruise
or two about hernothing for a trampbut the backs of her hands
were lacerated and the question was was it with fingernails </s>
<s>  now <abvr>
jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her face </s>
<s>  but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of </s>
<s>  and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there </s>
<s>  but the boldest point he made was this </s>
<s> 
it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was
under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder
frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto
revenge herself upon him </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers worked that in this way </s>
<s>  we say
these are not marks of fingernails but marks of brambles and we show
you the brambles </s>
<s>  you say they are marks of fingernails and you set
up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child </s>
<s>  you must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis </s>
<s>  for anything we know she may have
destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched
her hands </s>
<s>  what then </s>
<s>  you are not trying her for the murder of her
child </s>
<s>  why dont you </s>
<s>  as to this case if you will have scratches
we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them </s>
<s>  to
sum up sir said wemmick <abvr> jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury and they gave in </s>
<s> 

has she been in his service ever since </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but not only that said wemmick she went into his service
immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now </s>
<s>  she has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed
from the beginning </s>
<s> 

do you remember the sex of the child </s>
<s> 

said to have been a girl </s>
<s> 

you have nothing more to say to me tonight </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  i got your letter and destroyed it </s>
<s>  nothing </s>

we exchanged a cordial goodnight and i went home with new matter for
my thoughts though with no relief from the old </s>

chapter xlix

putting miss havishams note in my pocket that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went
down again by the coach next day </s>
<s>  but i alighted at the halfway house
and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance </s>
<s>  for i sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it
in the same manner </s>
<s> 

the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the high street </s>
<s>  the nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves </s>
<s>  the cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding
observation than they had ever had before </s>
<s>  so the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music </s>
<s>  and the rooks as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that
estella was gone out of it for ever </s>
<s> 

an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the
gate </s>
<s>  the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old
and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone </s>
<s>  miss havisham was not
in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing </s>
<s>  looking
in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the
ashy fire </s>
<s> 

doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old
chimneypiece where she could see me when she raised her eyes </s>
<s>  there
was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to
pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge
her with </s>
<s>  as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the
progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house her eyes rested on me </s>
<s>  she stared and said in a low voice
is it real </s>
<s> 

it is i pip </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost
no time </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  thank you </s>
<s> 

as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i
remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me </s>
<s> 

i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here and to show you that i am not all stone </s>
<s>  but perhaps you
can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart </s>
<s> 

when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right
hand as though she was going to touch me </s>
<s>  but she recalled it again
before i understood the action or knew how to receive it </s>
<s> 

you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good </s>
<s>  something that you would like done is it
not </s>
<s> 

something that i would like done very much </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s> 

i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership </s>
<s>  i had
not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking
in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said </s>
<s>  it seemed to be
so </s>
<s>  for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed
that she was conscious of the fact </s>
<s> 

do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid
of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me </s>
<s> 

no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham </s>
<s>  i stopped
because i thought you were not following what i said </s>
<s> 

perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head </s>
<s>  begin
again and let me look at something else </s>
<s>  stay </s>
<s>  now tell me </s>
<s> 

she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend </s>
<s>  i went on with my explanation and told her
how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how
in this i was disappointed </s>
<s>  that part of the subject i reminded her
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they
were the weighty secrets of another </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  said she assenting with her head but not looking at me </s>
<s>  and how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase </s>
<s> 

i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum </s>
<s>  nine
hundred pounds </s>
<s> 

if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own </s>
<s> 

quite as faithfully </s>
<s> 

and your mind will be more at rest </s>
<s> 

much more at rest </s>
<s> 

are you very unhappy now </s>
<s> 

she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy </s>
<s>  i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed
me </s>
<s>  she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid
her forehead on it </s>
<s> 

i am far from happy miss havisham </s>
<s>  but i have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of </s>
<s>  they are the secrets i have mentioned </s>
<s> 

after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again </s>
<s> 

it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness </s>
<s>  is it true </s>
<s> 

too true </s>
<s> 

can i only serve you pip by serving your friend </s>
<s>  regarding that as
done is there nothing i can do for you yourself </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  i thank you for the question </s>
<s>  i thank you even more for the
tone of the question </s>
<s>  but there is nothing </s>
<s> 

she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing </s>
<s>  there were none there and she took from her
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her neck </s>
<s> 

you are still on friendly terms with <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

quite </s>
<s>  i dined with him yesterday </s>
<s> 

this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend </s>
<s>  i keep no money here </s>
<s>  but if
you would rather <abvr> jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it
to you </s>
<s> 

thank you miss havisham </s>
<s>  i have not the least objection to receiving
it from him </s>
<s> 

she read me what she had written </s>
<s>  and it was direct and clear and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money </s>
<s>  i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled
again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached and put it in mine </s>
<s>  all this she did without
looking at me </s>
<s> 

my name is on the first leaf </s>
<s>  if you can ever write under my name i
forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it </s>
<s> 

o miss havisham said i i can do it now </s>
<s>  there have been sore
mistakes </s>
<s>  and my life has been a blind and thankless one </s>
<s>  and i want
forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you </s>
<s> 

she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it
and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees
at my feet </s>
<s>  with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which
when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have
been raised to heaven from her mothers side </s>
<s> 

to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame </s>
<s>  i entreated her to rise and got
my arms about her to help her up </s>
<s>  but she only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept </s>
<s>  i
had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the
relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking </s>
<s>  she was not
kneeling now but was down upon the ground </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  she cried despairingly </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s> 

if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me
answer </s>
<s>  very little </s>
<s>  i should have loved her under any circumstances </s>
<s>  is
she married </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so </s>
<s> 

what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  she wrung her hands and crushed
her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again </s>
<s>  what have
i done </s>
<s> 

i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her </s>
<s>  that she had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found
vengeance in i knew full well </s>
<s>  but that in shutting out the light
of day she had shut out infinitely more </s>
<s>  that in seclusion she had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences </s>
<s>  that
her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew
equally well </s>
<s>  and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her
punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth
on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the
vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world </s>
<s> 

until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a
lookingglass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know
what i had done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  and so again
twenty fifty times over what had she done </s>
<s> 

miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience </s>
<s>  but estella is a different case and if
you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years </s>
<s> 

yes yes i know it </s>
<s>  but pipmy dear </s>
<s>  there was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her new affection </s>
<s>  my dear </s>
<s>  believe this </s>
<s>  when she
first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own </s>
<s>  at first
i meant no more </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  i hope so </s>
<s> 

but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did
worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings
and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and
point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place </s>
<s> 

better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart
even to be bruised or broken </s>
<s> 

with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then
burst out again what had she done </s>
<s> 

if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me </s>
<s> 

miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may
say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left
this neighborhood </s>
<s>  it has inspired me with great commiseration and i
hope i understand it and its influences </s>
<s>  does what has passed between us
give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella </s>
<s>  not as
she is but as she was when she first came here </s>
<s> 

she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and
her head leaning on them </s>
<s>  she looked full at me when i said this and
replied go on </s>
<s> 

whose child was estella </s>
<s> 

she shook her head </s>
<s> 

you dont know </s>
<s> 

she shook her head again </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> jaggers brought her here or sent her here </s>
<s> 

brought her here </s>
<s> 

will you tell me how that came about </s>
<s> 

she answered in a low whisper and with caution </s>
<s>  i had been shut up in
these rooms a long time i dont know how long </s>
<s>  you know what time the
clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear
and love and save from my fate </s>
<s>  i had first seen him when i sent
for him to lay this place waste for me </s>
<s>  having read of him in the
newspapers before i and the world parted </s>
<s>  he told me that he would
look about him for such an orphan child </s>
<s>  one night he brought her here
asleep and i called her estella </s>
<s> 

might i ask her age then </s>
<s> 

two or three </s>
<s>  she herself knows nothing but that she was left an
orphan and i adopted her </s>
<s> 

so convinced i was of that womans being her mother that i wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind </s>
<s>  but to any mind i
thought the connection here was clear and straight </s>
<s> 

what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview </s>
<s>  i had
succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew
of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind </s>
<s>  no matter
with what other words we parted </s>
<s>  we parted </s>
<s> 

twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air </s>
<s>  i
called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would
not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving </s>
<s> 
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it </s>
<s> 

by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which
the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end i made my way to the ruined garden </s>
<s>  i went all round it </s>
<s>  round by
the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle </s>
<s>  round by the paths
where estella and i had walked </s>
<s>  so cold so lonely so dreary all </s>
<s> 

taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it and walked through </s>
<s>  i was going out at the
opposite doornot easy to open now for the damp wood had started and
swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of funguswhen i turned my head to look back </s>
<s>  a childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam </s>
<s>  so
strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before i knew it was a fancythough to be sure i was
there in an instant </s>
<s> 

the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of
this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i
had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart </s>
<s>  passing on into
the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs
and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left
her </s>
<s>  i took the latter course and went up </s>
<s> 

i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards
me </s>
<s>  in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away
i saw a great flaming light spring up </s>
<s>  in the same moment i saw her
running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her
and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high </s>
<s> 

i had a doublecaped greatcoat on and over my arm another thick coat </s>
<s> 
that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over
her </s>
<s>  that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and
all the ugly things that sheltered there </s>
<s>  that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her
the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herselfthat this
occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or
thought or knew i did </s>
<s>  i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the
floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded
bridal dress </s>
<s> 

then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door </s>
<s>  i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like
a prisoner who might escape </s>
<s>  and i doubt if i even knew who she was or
why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames
were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us </s>
<s> 

she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even
touched </s>
<s>  assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if
i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire
would break out again and consume her </s>
<s>  when i got up on the surgeons
coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt </s>
<s>  for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling </s>
<s> 

on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless </s>
<s>  the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock </s>
<s>  by the surgeons directions her bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her injuries </s>
<s>  when i saw her again an
hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick
and had heard her say that she would lie one day </s>
<s> 

though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance </s>
<s>  for they had
covered her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her </s>
<s> 

i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i
got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post </s>
<s>  miss havishams family i took upon myself </s>
<s>  intending to
communicate with <abvr> matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he
liked about informing the rest </s>
<s>  this i did next day through herbert as
soon as i returned to town </s>
<s> 

there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had
happened though with a certain terrible vivacity </s>
<s>  towards midnight she
began to wander in her speech </s>
<s>  and after that it gradually set in that
she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done </s>
<s> 
 and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like
mine </s>
<s>  and then take the pencil and write under my name �i forgive
her </s>
<s>  she never changed the order of these three sentences but she
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them </s>
<s>  never putting in
another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word </s>
<s> 

as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive
out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would
return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being
taken up clear of the town </s>
<s>  at about six oclock of the morning
therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as
they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write
under my name �i forgive her </s>
<s> 




chapter l

my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in
the morning </s>
<s>  my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less
severely as high as the shoulder </s>
<s>  it was very painful but the flames
had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse </s>
<s>  my right
hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers </s>
<s>  it was
bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm </s>
<s>  those i carried in a sling </s>
<s>  and i could only wear my coat like a
cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck </s>
<s>  my hair had
been caught by the fire but not my head or face </s>
<s> 

when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came
back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me </s>
<s>  he
was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them
on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for </s>
<s> 

at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i
might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell </s>
<s>  if i
dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havishams cries and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head </s>
<s>  this pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i
suffered </s>
<s>  and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention
engaged </s>
<s> 

neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it </s>
<s>  that
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our
agreeingwithout agreementto make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours not of so many weeks </s>
<s> 

my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all
was well down the river </s>
<s>  as he replied in the affirmative with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away </s>
<s>  but then as herbert changed the bandages more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it
spontaneously </s>
<s> 

i sat with provis last night handel two good hours </s>
<s> 

where was clara </s>
<s> 

dear little thing </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  she was up and down with
gruffandgrim all the evening </s>
<s>  he was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she left his sight </s>
<s>  i doubt if he can hold out long though </s>
<s> 
what with rum and pepperand pepper and rumi should think his
pegging must be nearly over </s>
<s> 

and then you will be married herbert </s>
<s> 

how can i take care of the dear child otherwise </s>
<s> lay your arm out upon
the back of the sofa my dear boy and ill sit down here and get the
bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes </s>
<s>  i was
speaking of provis </s>
<s>  do you know handel he improves </s>
<s> 

i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him </s>
<s> 

so you did </s>
<s>  and so he is </s>
<s>  he was very communicative last night and
told me more of his life </s>
<s>  you remember his breaking off here about some
woman that he had had great trouble with </s>
<s> did i hurt you </s>
<s> 

i had started but not under his touch </s>
<s>  his words had given me a start </s>
<s> 

i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is </s>
<s> 
shall i tell you </s>
<s>  or would it worry you just now </s>
<s> 

tell me by all means </s>
<s>  every word </s>
<s> 

herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for </s>
<s>  your
head is cool </s>
<s>  he said touching it </s>
<s> 

quite said i </s>
<s>  tell me what provis said my dear herbert </s>
<s> 

it seems said herbert theres a bandage off most charmingly and
now comes the cool onemakes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow
dont it </s>
<s>  but it will be comfortable presentlyit seems that the
woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman </s>
<s> 
revengeful handel to the last degree </s>
<s> 

to what last degree </s>
<s> 

murder </s>
<s> does it strike too cold on that sensitive place </s>
<s> 

i dont feel it </s>
<s>  how did she murder </s>
<s>  whom did she murder </s>
<s> 

why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name
 said herbert but she was tried for it and <abvr> jaggers defended
her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known
to provis </s>
<s>  it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim
and there had been a strugglein a barn </s>
<s>  who began it or how fair
it was or how unfair may be doubtful </s>
<s>  but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled </s>
<s> 

was the woman brought in guilty </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  she was acquitted </s>
<s> my poor handel i hurt you </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to be gentler herbert </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  what else </s>
<s> 

this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child </s>
<s>  a little
child of whom provis was exceedingly fond </s>
<s>  on the evening of the very
night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the
young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore
that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he
should never see it again </s>
<s>  then she vanished </s>
<s> theres the worst arm
comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right
hand which is a far easier job </s>
<s>  i can do it better by this light
than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i dont see the poor
blistered patches too distinctly </s>
<s> you dont think your breathing is
affected my dear boy </s>
<s>  you seem to breathe quickly </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do herbert </s>
<s>  did the woman keep her oath </s>
<s> 

there comes the darkest part of proviss life </s>
<s>  she did </s>
<s> 

that is he says she did </s>
<s> 

why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise
and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me </s>
<s>  he says it all </s>
<s>  i
have no other information </s>
<s> 

no to be sure </s>
<s> 

now whether pursued herbert he had used the childs mother ill or
whether he had used the childs mother well provis doesnt say </s>
<s>  but she
had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described
to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and
forbearance towards her </s>
<s>  therefore fearing he should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he
hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he
says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose </s>
<s>  after
the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the
childs mother </s>
<s> 

i want to ask

a moment my dear boy and i have done </s>
<s>  that evil genius compeyson
the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping
out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course
afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him
poorer and working him harder </s>
<s>  it was clear last night that this barbed
the point of proviss animosity </s>
<s> 

i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told
you when this happened </s>
<s> 

particularly </s>
<s>  let me remember then what he said as to that </s>
<s>  his
expression was �a round score o year ago and amost directly after i
took up wi compeyson </s>
<s>  how old were you when you came upon him in the
little churchyard </s>
<s> 

i think in my seventh year </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  it had happened some three or four years then he said and you
brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have
been about your age </s>
<s> 

herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see
me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire </s>
<s> 

by the firelight answered herbert coming close again </s>
<s> 

look at me </s>
<s> 

i do look at you my dear boy </s>
<s> 

touch me </s>
<s> 

i do touch you my dear boy </s>
<s> 

you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night </s>
<s> 

nno my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me </s>
<s>  you
are rather excited but you are quite yourself </s>
<s> 

i know i am quite myself </s>
<s>  and the man we have in hiding down the river
is estellas father </s>
<s> 




chapter li

what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving
estellas parentage i cannot say </s>
<s>  it will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own </s>
<s> 

but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized
with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter downthat i
ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see <abvr> jaggers and come
at the bare truth </s>
<s>  i really do not know whether i felt that i did this
for estellas sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me </s>
<s>  perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth </s>
<s> 

any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street
that night </s>
<s>  herberts representations that if i did i should probably
be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitives safety would depend
upon me alone restrained my impatience </s>
<s>  on the understanding again
and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to <abvr> jaggers
tomorrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts
looked after and to stay at home </s>
<s>  early next morning we went out
together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left
herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain </s>
<s> 

there were periodical occasions when <abvr> jaggers and wemmick went over
the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things
straight </s>
<s>  on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into <abvr>
jaggerss room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer
office </s>
<s>  finding such clerk on wemmicks post that morning i knew
what was going on </s>
<s>  but i was not sorry to have <abvr> jaggers and wemmick
together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to
compromise him </s>
<s> 

my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders
favored my object </s>
<s>  although i had sent <abvr> jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all
the details now </s>
<s>  and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence than it had been before </s>
<s>  while i described the disaster <abvr>
jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire </s>
<s>  wemmick leaned
back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his
trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post </s>
<s>  the two brutal
casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at
the present moment </s>
<s> 

my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced
miss havishams authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
herbert </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick
with instructions to draw the check for his signature </s>
<s>  while that was
in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and <abvr>
jaggers poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots looked
on at me </s>
<s>  i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket
when he had signed it that we do nothing for you </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she
could do nothing for me and i told her no </s>
<s> 

everybody should know his own business said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  and i saw
wemmicks lips form the words portable property </s>
<s> 

i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers </s>
<s> 
but every man ought to know his own business best </s>
<s> 

every mans business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me
is portable property </s>
<s> 

as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at
heart i said turning on <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i did ask something of miss havisham however sir </s>
<s>  i asked her to give
me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me
all she possessed </s>
<s> 

did she </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself </s>
<s>  hah </s>
<s>  i dont think i should have done so
if i had been miss havisham </s>
<s>  but she ought to know her own business
best </s>
<s> 

i know more of the history of miss havishams adopted child than miss
havisham herself does sir </s>
<s>  i know her mother </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother </s>
<s> 

i have seen her mother within these three days </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

and so have you sir </s>
<s>  and you have seen her still more recently </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

perhaps i know more of estellas history than even you do said i </s>
<s>  i
know her father too </s>
<s> 

a certain stop that <abvr> jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too
selfpossessed to change his manner but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not
know who her father was </s>
<s>  this i had strongly suspected from proviss
account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark </s>
<s> 
which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not <abvr> jaggerss
client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for
claiming his identity </s>
<s>  but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on <abvr> jaggerss part before though i was quite sure of it now </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  you know the young ladys father pip </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

yes i replied and his name is provisfrom new south wales </s>
<s> 

even <abvr> jaggers started when i said those words </s>
<s>  it was the slightest
start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the
action of taking out his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s>  how wemmick received the
announcement i am unable to say </s>
<s>  for i was afraid to look at him just
then lest <abvr> jaggerss sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him between us </s>
<s> 

and on what evidence pip asked <abvr> jaggers very coolly as he
paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make
this claim </s>
<s> 

he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence </s>
<s> 

for once the powerful pockethandkerchief failed </s>
<s>  my reply was so
unexpected that <abvr> jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked
with stern attention at me though with an immovable face </s>
<s> 

then i told him all i knew and how i knew it </s>
<s>  with the one reservation
that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact
knew from wemmick </s>
<s>  i was very careful indeed as to that </s>
<s>  nor did i look
towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for
some time silently meeting <abvr> jaggerss look </s>
<s>  when i did at last turn
my eyes in wemmicks direction i found that he had unposted his pen
and was intent upon the table before him </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the
table </s>
<s>  what item was it you were at wemmick when <abvr> pip came in </s>
<s> 

but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a
passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and
manly with me </s>
<s>  i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had
lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had
made </s>
<s>  and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits </s>
<s>  i
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted </s>
<s>  i said that
i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted
assurance of the truth from him </s>
<s>  and if he asked me why i wanted it
and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he
cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long
and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world </s>
<s>  and seeing that <abvr> jaggers stood quite still and
silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to
wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle
heart </s>
<s>  i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the
innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life </s>
<s>  and i entreat you to say a word for me to <abvr> jaggers and to
represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more
open with me </s>
<s> 

i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than <abvr>
jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe </s>
<s>  at first a misgiving
crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment </s>
<s>  but it melted as i saw <abvr> jaggers relax into something like
a smile and wemmick become bolder </s>
<s> 

whats all this </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  you with an old father and you
with pleasant and playful ways </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  returned wemmick </s>
<s>  if i dont bring �em here what does it
matter </s>
<s> 

pip said <abvr> jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling
openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder </s>
<s>  i think
youre another </s>
<s> 

again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in </s>
<s> 

you with a pleasant home </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

since it dont interfere with business returned wemmick let it be
so </s>
<s>  now i look at you sir i shouldnt wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days
when youre tired of all this work </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and
actually drew a sigh </s>
<s>  pip said he we wont talk about �poor
dreams </s>
<s>  you know more about such things than i having much fresher
experience of that kind </s>
<s>  but now about this other matter </s>
<s>  ill put a
case to you </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  i admit nothing </s>
<s> 

he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing </s>
<s> 

now pip said <abvr> jaggers put this case </s>
<s>  put the case that a
woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child
concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser
on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the
latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child </s>
<s>  put the
case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up </s>
<s> 

i follow you sir </s>
<s> 

put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he
saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain
destruction </s>
<s>  put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen </s>
<s>  put the case that
he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported
neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing
up to be hanged </s>
<s>  put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw
in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much
spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his netto be
prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow </s>
<s> 

i follow you sir </s>
<s> 

put the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the
heap who could be saved </s>
<s>  whom the father believed dead and dared make
no stir about </s>
<s>  as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this
power </s>
<s>  i know what you did and how you did it </s>
<s>  you came so and so you
did such and such things to divert suspicion </s>
<s>  i have tracked you through
it all and i tell it you all </s>
<s>  part with the child unless it should
be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced </s>
<s> 
give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring you off </s>
<s>  if
you are saved your child is saved too </s>
<s>  if you are lost your child is
still saved </s>
<s>  put the case that this was done and that the woman was
cleared </s>
<s> 

i understand you perfectly </s>
<s> 

but that i make no admissions </s>
<s> 

that you make no admissions </s>
<s>  and wemmick repeated no admissions </s>
<s> 

put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the womans intellects and that when she was set at liberty
she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be
sheltered </s>
<s>  put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the
old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
out by asserting his power over her in the old way </s>
<s>  do you comprehend
the imaginary case </s>
<s> 

quite </s>
<s> 

put the case that the child grew up and was married for money </s>
<s>  that
the mother was still living </s>
<s>  that the father was still living </s>
<s>  that the
mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many
miles furlongs yards if you like of one another </s>
<s>  that the secret was
still a secret except that you had got wind of it </s>
<s>  put that last case
to yourself very carefully </s>
<s> 

i do </s>
<s> 

i ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefully </s>
<s> 

and wemmick said i do </s>
<s> 

for whose sake would you reveal the secret </s>
<s>  for the fathers </s>
<s>  i think
he would not be much the better for the mother </s>
<s>  for the mothers </s>
<s>  i
think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was </s>
<s> 
for the daughters </s>
<s>  i think it would hardly serve her to establish her
parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to
disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for
life </s>
<s>  but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her the
subject of those �poor dreams which have at one time or another been
in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you that you
had betterand would much sooner when you had thought well of itchop
off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and
then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too </s>
<s> 

i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave </s>
<s>  he gravely touched his
lips with his forefinger </s>
<s>  i did the same </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers did the same </s>
<s> 
now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what
item was it you were at when <abvr> pip came in </s>
<s> 

standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times </s>
<s>  with
this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say
conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to
the other </s>
<s>  for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one
another </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers being highly dictatorial and wemmick obstinately
justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment </s>
<s>  i had never seen them on such ill terms </s>
<s>  for generally they
got on very well indeed together </s>
<s> 

but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his
sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within
those walls </s>
<s>  this individual who either in his own person or in that
of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in
that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter
was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting </s>
<s>  as he imparted this melancholy
circumstance to wemmick <abvr> jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings mikes eye happened to
twinkle with a tear </s>
<s> 

what are you about </s>
<s>  demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation </s>
<s> 
what do you come snivelling here for </s>
<s> 

i didnt go to do it <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

you did said wemmick </s>
<s>  how dare you </s>
<s>  youre not in a fit state to
come here if you cant come here without spluttering like a bad pen </s>
<s> 
what do you mean by it </s>
<s> 

a man cant help his feelings <abvr> wemmick pleaded mike </s>
<s> 

his what </s>
<s>  demanded wemmick quite savagely </s>
<s>  say that again </s>
<s> 

now look here my man said <abvr> jaggers advancing a step and pointing
to the door </s>
<s>  get out of this office </s>
<s>  ill have no feelings here </s>
<s>  get
out </s>
<s> 

it serves you right said wemmick get out </s>
<s> 

so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and <abvr> jaggers and
wemmick appeared to have reestablished their good understanding and
went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
just had lunch </s>

chapter lii


from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss
skiffinss brother the accountant </s>
<s>  and miss skiffinss brother the
accountant going straight to clarrikers and bringing clarriker to me
i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement </s>
<s>  it was the
only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done
since i was first apprised of my great expectations </s>
<s> 

clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house
were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a
small branchhouse in the east which was much wanted for the extension
of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for
a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more
settled </s>
<s>  and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves </s>
<s> 

but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told
me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara
barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join
them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the
nile and seeing wonders </s>
<s>  without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans i felt that herberts way was clearing fast and
that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his
daughter would soon be happily provided for </s>
<s> 

we had now got into the month of march </s>
<s>  my left arm though it presented
no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i
was still unable to get a coat on </s>
<s>  my right arm was tolerably restored </s>
<s> 
disfigured but fairly serviceable </s>
<s> 

on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received
the following letter from wemmick by the post </s>
<s> 

walworth </s>
<s>  burn this as soon as read </s>
<s>  early in the week or say
wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try
it </s>
<s>  now burn </s>
<s> 

when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the firebut not
before we had both got it by heartwe considered what to do </s>
<s>  for of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view </s>
<s> 

i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i
know a better course than taking a thames waterman </s>
<s>  take startop </s>
<s>  a good
fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honorable </s>
<s> 

i had thought of him more than once </s>
<s> 

but how much would you tell him herbert </s>
<s> 

it is necessary to tell him very little </s>
<s>  let him suppose it a mere
freak but a secret one until the morning comes </s>
<s>  then let him know that
there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away </s>
<s>  you go
with him </s>
<s> 

no doubt </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s> 

it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the
point almost indifferent what port we made forhamburg rotterdam
antwerpthe place signified little so that he was out of england </s>
<s>  any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do </s>
<s> 
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the
boat </s>
<s>  certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot </s>
<s>  as foreign steamers would
leave london at about the time of highwater our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebbtide and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one </s>
<s>  the time when one would be due where we
lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we
made inquiries beforehand </s>
<s> 

herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations </s>
<s>  we found that a steamer for
hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel </s>
<s>  but we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each </s>
<s>  we then separated
for a few hours </s>
<s>  i to get at once such passports as were necessary </s>
<s> 
herbert to see startop at his lodgings </s>
<s>  we both did what we had to do
without any hindrance and when we met again at one oclock reported
it done </s>
<s>  i for my part was prepared with passports </s>
<s>  herbert had seen
startop and he was more than ready to join </s>
<s> 

those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer </s>
<s>  our
charge would be sitter and keep quiet </s>
<s>  as speed was not our object we
should make way enough </s>
<s>  we arranged that herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening </s>
<s>  that he should
not go there at all tomorrow evening tuesday </s>
<s>  that he should prepare
provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when
he saw us approach and not sooner </s>
<s>  that all the arrangements with
him should be concluded that monday night </s>
<s>  and that he should be
communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board </s>
<s> 

these precautions well understood by both of us i went home </s>
<s> 

on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter
in the box directed to me </s>
<s>  a very dirty letter though not illwritten </s>
<s> 
it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its
contents were these </s>
<s> 

if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow
night at nine and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln
you had better come </s>
<s>  if you want information regarding your uncle
provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time </s>
<s>  you
must come alone </s>
<s>  bring this with you </s>
<s> 

i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter </s>
<s>  what to do now i could not tell </s>
<s>  and the worst was that i must
decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take
me down in time for tonight </s>
<s>  tomorrow night i could not think of
going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight </s>
<s>  and again
for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself </s>
<s> 

if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have
gone </s>
<s>  having hardly any time for considerationmy watch showing me
that the coach started within half an houri resolved to go </s>
<s>  i should
certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis </s>
<s>  that
coming on wemmicks letter and the mornings busy preparation turned
the scale </s>
<s> 

it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind </s>
<s>  yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should
be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry
down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring </s>
<s> 
i had then barely time to get my greatcoat lock up the chambers
and make for the coachoffice by the short byways </s>
<s>  if i had taken a
hackneychariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim </s>
<s> 
going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard </s>
<s>  i
was the only inside passenger jolting away kneedeep in straw when i
came to myself </s>
<s> 

for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter </s>
<s>  it had
so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning </s>
<s>  the morning hurry
and flutter had been great </s>
<s>  for long and anxiously as i had waited for
wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last </s>
<s>  and now i began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had
sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should
get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried
people are strangers </s>
<s>  still the reference to provis by name mastered
everything </s>
<s>  i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing itif
that be reasoningin case any harm should befall him through my not
going how could i ever forgive myself </s>
<s> 

it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside
in my disabled state </s>
<s>  avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner </s>
<s>  while it was
preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham </s>
<s>  she was
still very ill though considered something better </s>
<s> 

my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i
dined in a little octagonal commonroom like a font </s>
<s>  as i was not able
to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me </s>
<s>  this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain
me with my own storyof course with the popular feature that
pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes </s>
<s> 

do you know the young man </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

know him </s>
<s>  repeated the landlord </s>
<s>  ever since he wasno height at
all </s>
<s> 

does he ever come back to this neighborhood </s>
<s> 

ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and
again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him </s>
<s> 

what man is that </s>
<s> 

him that i speak of said the landlord </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

is he ungrateful to no one else </s>
<s> 

no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he
cant </s>
<s>  and why </s>
<s>  because pumblechook done everything for him </s>
<s> 

does pumblechook say so </s>
<s> 

say so </s>
<s>  replied the landlord </s>
<s>  he hant no call to say so </s>
<s> 

but does he say so </s>
<s> 

it would turn a mans blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of
it sir said the landlord </s>
<s> 

i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it </s>
<s>  longsuffering and
loving joe you never complain </s>
<s>  nor you sweettempered biddy </s>
<s> 

your appetites been touched like by your accident said the landlord
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat </s>
<s>  try a tenderer bit </s>
<s> 

no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the
fire </s>
<s>  i can eat no more </s>
<s>  please take it away </s>
<s> 

i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as
through the brazen impostor pumblechook </s>
<s>  the falser he the truer joe </s>
<s> 
the meaner he the nobler joe </s>
<s> 

my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire
for an hour or more </s>
<s>  the striking of the clock aroused me but not from
my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck and went out </s>
<s>  i had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter that i might refer to it again </s>
<s>  but i could not find it and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach </s>
<s>  i knew very well however that the appointed place was the
little sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine </s>
<s> 
towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare </s>
<s> 




chapter liii

it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed
lands and passed out upon the marshes </s>
<s>  beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon </s>
<s> 
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the
piled mountains of cloud </s>
<s> 

there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal </s>
<s>  a
stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were
so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back </s>
<s>  but i knew
them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had
no excuse for returning being there </s>
<s>  so having come there against my
inclination i went on against it </s>
<s> 

the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts </s>
<s>  my back was turned towards
the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder </s>
<s>  i knew the
limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart </s>
<s> 
so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks </s>
<s> 

at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds </s>
<s>  but after a little while i
seemed to have the whole flats to myself </s>
<s> 

it was another halfhour before i drew near to the kiln </s>
<s>  the lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and
left and no workmen were visible </s>
<s>  hard by was a small stonequarry </s>
<s>  it
lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about </s>
<s> 

coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavationfor the rude
path lay through iti saw a light in the old sluicehouse </s>
<s>  i quickened
my pace and knocked at the door with my hand </s>
<s>  waiting for some reply
i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and
how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the
weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me </s>
<s>  still there was no answer and i knocked again </s>
<s> 
no answer still and i tried the latch </s>
<s> 

it rose under my hand and the door yielded </s>
<s>  looking in i saw a lighted
candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead </s>
<s>  as
there was a loft above i called is there any one here </s>
<s>  but no voice
answered </s>
<s>  then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine
called again is there any one here </s>
<s>  there being still no answer i
went out at the door irresolute what to do </s>
<s> 

it was beginning to rain fast </s>
<s>  seeing nothing save what i had seen
already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway looking out into the night </s>
<s>  while i was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or
the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the
wick were long </s>
<s>  i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in
my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock </s>
<s>  and the next
thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running
noose thrown over my head from behind </s>
<s> 

now said a suppressed voice with an oath ive got you </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s>  i cried struggling </s>
<s>  who is it </s>
<s>  help help help </s>
<s> 

not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain </s>
<s>  sometimes a strong mans hand
sometimes a strong mans breast was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled
ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall </s>
<s>  and
now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and
ill make short work of you </s>
<s> 

faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the
surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little </s>
<s> 
but it was bound too tight for that </s>
<s>  i felt as if having been burnt
before it were now being boiled </s>
<s> 

the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black
darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter </s>
<s> 
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he
wanted and began to strike a light </s>
<s>  i strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed
match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of
the match </s>
<s>  even those but fitfully </s>
<s>  the tinder was dampno wonder
thereand one after another the sparks died out </s>
<s> 

the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel </s>
<s>  as
the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and
touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending
over the table </s>
<s>  but nothing more </s>
<s>  presently i saw his blue lips again
breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and
showed me orlick </s>
<s> 

whom i had looked for i dont know </s>
<s>  i had not looked for him </s>
<s>  seeing
him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes
upon him </s>
<s> 

he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation
and dropped the match and trod it out </s>
<s>  then he put the candle away from
him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded
on the table and looked at me </s>
<s>  i made out that i was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the walla fixture therethe
means of ascent to the loft above </s>

now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time ive
got you </s>

unbind me </s>

why have you set upon me in the dark </s>

because i mean to do it all myself </s>
<s>  one keeps a secret better than two </s>
<s> 
o you enemy you enemy </s>
<s> 

his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms
folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a
malignity in it that made me tremble </s>
<s>  as i watched him in silence
he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a
brassbound stock </s>
<s> 

do you know this </s>
<s>  said he making as if he would take aim at me </s>

you know where you saw it afore </s>

you did that and that would be enough without more </s>

youre a liar </s>

<s>  said he repeating my words to biddy
in the last interview i had with her </s>

information </s>
<s>  it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is tonight </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  if it was all your money twenty times
told to the last brass farden </s>
<s>  as he shook his heavy hand at me with
his mouth snarling like a tigers i felt that it was true </s>

what are you going to do to me </s>
<s> 

im a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater forceim
a going to have your life </s>
<s> 

he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again </s>

you was always in old orlicks way since ever you was a child </s>

out of his way this present night </s>

i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave </s>

wildly round my trap for any chance of escape </s>

more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i wont
have a rag of you i wont have a bone of you left on earth </s>
<s>  ill put
your body in the kilnid carry two such to it on my shouldersand
let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing </s>
<s> 

my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death </s>
<s>  estellas father would believe i had deserted him
would be taken would die accusing me </s>
<s>  even herbert would doubt me
when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had
called at miss havishams gate for only a moment </s>
<s>  joe and biddy would
never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what
i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed
through </s>
<s>  the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death </s>
<s>  and
so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn
generationsestellas children and their childrenwhile the
wretchs words were yet on his lips </s>

now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beastwhich is

<s> 

it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again </s>
<s>  though
few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the
hopelessness of aid </s>
<s>  but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by
a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips </s>
<s>  above all things i
resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some
last poor resistance to him </s>
<s>  softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity </s>
<s>  humbly beseeching pardon as i did of
heaven </s>
<s>  melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no
farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errorsstill if i could have killed him even in dying i
would have done it </s>
<s> 

he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot </s>
<s>  around his
neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink
slung about him in other days </s>
<s>  he brought the bottle to his lips and
took a fiery drink from it </s>

flash into his face </s>
<s> 

wolf </s>
<s>  said he folding his arms again old orlicks a going to tell
you somethink </s>
<s>  it was you as did for your shrew sister </s>
<s> 

again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the
whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death
before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words </s>
<s> 

it was you villain said i </s>
<s> 

i tell you it was your doingi tell you it was done through you he
retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us </s>
<s>  i come upon her from behind as i come upon you
tonight </s>
<s>  i giv it her </s>
<s>  i left her for dead and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldnt have come

favored and he was bullied and beat </s>
<s>  old orlick bullied and beat eh </s>
<s> 
now you pays for it </s>
<s>  you done it </s>
<s>  now you pays for it </s>
<s> 

he drank again and became more ferocious </s>
<s>  i saw by his tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it </s>
<s>  i distinctly
understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me </s>
<s>  i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life </s>
<s>  i knew
that when i was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do
as he had done in my sisters casemake all haste to the town and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses </s>
<s>  my rapid mind
pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it
and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white
vapor creeping over it into which i should have dissolved </s>
<s> 

it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years
while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures
to me and not mere words </s>
<s>  in the excited and exalted state of my brain
i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons without
seeing them </s>
<s>  it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these
images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himselfwho
would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring </s>
<s> that i knew of
the slightest action of his fingers </s>
<s> 

when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which
he sat and pushed the table aside </s>
<s>  then he took up the candle and
shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood
before me looking at me and enjoying the sight </s>
<s> 

wolf ill tell you something more </s>
<s>  it was old orlick as you tumbled
over on your stairs that night </s>

i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps </s>

in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i
turned my face aside to save it from the flame </s>

he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an
instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
light on the table </s>
<s>  i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and
biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again </s>
<s> 

there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall </s>
<s>  within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards </s>
<s>  his
great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he
did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with
his eyes scowling at me </s>
<s>  i had no grain of hope left </s>
<s>  wild as my inward
hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had
resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told </s>
<s> 

of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed
it away </s>
<s>  light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet </s>
<s>  he swallowed
slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at
me no more </s>
<s>  the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his
hand and licked up </s>
<s>  then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped </s>
<s>  and i saw in his
hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle </s>
<s> 

the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and
struggled with all my might </s>
<s>  it was only my head and my legs that i
could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until
then unknown that was within me </s>
<s>  in the same instant i heard responsive
shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard
voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if
it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the
night </s>
<s> 

after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the
same place with my head on some ones knee </s>
<s>  my eyes were fixed on the
ladder against the wall when i came to myselfhad opened on it before
my mind saw itand thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i
was in the place where i had lost it </s>
<s> 

too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported
me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it
a face </s>
<s>  the face of trabbs boy </s>
<s> 

i think hes all right </s>
<s>  said trabbs boy in a sober voice </s>
<s>  but aint
he just pale though </s>
<s> 

at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine
and i saw my supporter to be

herbert </s>
<s>  great heaven </s>
<s> 

softly said herbert </s>
<s>  gently handel </s>
<s>  dont be too eager </s>
<s> 

and our old comrade startop </s>
<s>  i cried as he too bent over me </s>
<s> 

remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert and be
calm </s>
<s> 

the allusion made me spring up </s>
<s>  though i dropped again from the pain
in my arm </s>
<s>  the time has not gone by herbert has it </s>
<s>  what night is
tonight </s>
<s>  how long have i been here </s>
<s>  for i had a strange and
strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long timea day and a
nighttwo days and nightsmore </s>
<s> 

the time has not gone by </s>
<s>  it is still monday night </s>
<s> 

thank god </s>
<s> 

and you have all tomorrow tuesday to rest in said herbert </s>

you cant help groaning my dear handel </s>
<s>  what hurt have you got </s>
<s>  can you
stand </s>
<s> 

yes yes said i i can walk </s>
<s>  i have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm </s>
<s> 

they laid it bare and did what they could </s>
<s>  it was violently swollen and
inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched </s>
<s>  but they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced
it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it </s>
<s>  in a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluicehouse and were passing through the quarry on our
way back </s>
<s>  trabbs boytrabbs overgrown young man nowwent before us
with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door </s>
<s>  but
the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky
and the night though rainy was much lighter </s>
<s>  the white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer
before i thought a thanksgiving now </s>
<s> 

entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescuewhich at
first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining
quieti learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our
chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i
was gone </s>
<s>  its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him </s>
<s>  his
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an
hours consideration he set off for the coachoffice with startop who
volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went
down </s>
<s>  finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he
resolved to follow in a postchaise </s>
<s>  so he and startop arrived at the
blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me </s>
<s>  but
finding neither went on to miss havishams where they lost me </s>
<s> 
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when
i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes </s>
<s>  among
the loungers under the boars archway happened to be trabbs boytrue
to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no
businessand trabbs boy had seen me passing from miss havishams in
the direction of my diningplace </s>
<s>  thus trabbs boy became their guide
and with him they went out to the sluicehouse though by the town way
to the marshes which i had avoided </s>
<s>  now as they went along herbert
reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to proviss safety and
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous
left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by
himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within </s>
<s>  as he could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so
busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly
i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely
followed by the other two </s>
<s> 

when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it
was and getting out a warrant </s>
<s>  but i had already considered that such
a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might
be fatal to provis </s>
<s>  there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time </s>
<s>  for the
present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to trabbs boy </s>
<s>  who i am convinced would have been
much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention
saved me from the limekiln </s>
<s>  not that trabbs boy was of a malignant
nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodys expense </s>
<s>  when
we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his
views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him which made no impression on him at all </s>
<s> 

wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london
that night three in the postchaise </s>
<s>  the rather as we should then be
clear away before the nights adventure began to be talked of </s>
<s>  herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm </s>
<s>  and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain
on the journey </s>
<s>  it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went
at once to bed and lay in bed all day </s>
<s> 

my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for
tomorrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of
itself </s>
<s>  it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon
me that tomorrow was </s>
<s>  so anxiously looked forward to charged with such
consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near </s>
<s> 

no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day </s>
<s>  yet this again increased my
restlessness </s>
<s>  i started at every footstep and every sound believing
that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell
me so </s>
<s>  i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken </s>
<s>  that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment </s>
<s>  that the fact
had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it </s>
<s>  as the days wore
on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow
morning altogether mastered me </s>
<s>  my burning arm throbbed and my burning
head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander </s>
<s>  i counted up to
high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew
in prose and verse </s>
<s>  it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot </s>
<s>  then i would say to
myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious </s>
<s> 

they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and
gave me cooling drinks </s>
<s>  whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion
i had had in the sluicehouse that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him was gone </s>
<s>  about midnight i got out of bed
and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for
fourandtwenty hours and that wednesday was past </s>
<s>  it was the last
selfexhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept
soundly </s>
<s> 

wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window </s>
<s>  the winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon </s>
<s>  the river still dark and mysterious was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky </s>
<s>  as i looked along
the clustered roofs with churchtowers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters </s>
<s>  from me
too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well </s>
<s> 

herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on
the sofa </s>
<s>  i could not dress myself without help </s>
<s>  but i made up the fire
which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them </s>
<s>  in good
time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us </s>
<s> 

when it turns at nine oclock said herbert cheerfully look out for
us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank </s>

chapter liv

it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold </s>
<s>  when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade </s>
<s> 
we had our peacoats with us and i took a bag </s>
<s>  of all my worldly
possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag </s>
<s>  where i might go what i might do or when i might return were
questions utterly unknown to me </s>
<s>  nor did i vex my mind with them for
it was wholly set on proviss safety </s>
<s>  i only wondered for the passing
moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered
circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever </s>
<s> 

we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all </s>
<s>  of course i had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order </s>
<s>  after
a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went
on board and cast off </s>
<s>  herbert in the bow i steering </s>
<s>  it was then about
highwaterhalfpast eight </s>
<s> 

our plan was this </s>
<s>  the tide beginning to run down at nine and being
with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned
and row against it until dark </s>
<s>  we should then be well in those long
reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is
broad and solitary where the waterside inhabitants are very few and
where lone publichouses are scattered here and there of which we could
choose one for a restingplace </s>
<s>  there we meant to lie by all night </s>
<s> 
the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from
london at about nine on thursday morning </s>
<s>  we should know at what time
to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first </s>
<s> 
so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have
another chance </s>
<s>  we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel </s>
<s> 

the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which i had been a few hours before </s>
<s>  the crisp air the sunlight the
movement on the river and the moving river itselfthe road that ran
with us seeming to sympathize with us animate us and encourage us
onfreshened me with new hope </s>
<s>  i felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat </s>
<s>  but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day </s>
<s> 

at that time the steamtraffic on the thames was far below its present
extent and watermens boats were far more numerous </s>
<s>  of barges sailing
colliers and coastingtraders there were perhaps as many as now </s>
<s> 
but of steamships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many </s>
<s>  early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide </s>
<s> 
the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these </s>
<s>  and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly </s>
<s> 

old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its
oysterboats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitors gate and
we were in among the tiers of shipping </s>
<s>  here were the leith aberdeen
and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside </s>
<s>  here were colliers by the
score and score with the coalwhippers plunging off stages on deck as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled
over the side into barges </s>
<s>  here at her moorings was tomorrows steamer

it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he

he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
england </s>

in constant terror </s>
<s>  for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would

down again </s>

the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the
sunshine was very cheering </s>

twos length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the
stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us </s>
<s>  and soon
the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing
and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks </s>
<s> 

our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive
with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hours rest
proved full as much as they wanted </s>
<s>  we got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about </s>
<s> 
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a
dim horizon </s>
<s>  while the winding river turned and turned and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed
stranded and still </s>
<s>  for now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed </s>
<s>  and the last green barge strawladen
with a brown sail had followed </s>
<s>  and some ballastlighters shaped like
a childs first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud </s>
<s>  and a
little squat shoallighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud
on stilts and crutches </s>
<s>  and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud and an old landingstage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud </s>
<s> 

we pushed off again and made what way we could </s>
<s>  it was much harder work
now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down </s>
<s>  by that time the river had lifted us a little
so that we could see above the bank </s>
<s>  there was the red sun on the low
level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black </s>
<s>  and
there was the solitary flat marsh </s>
<s>  and far away there were the rising
grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull </s>
<s> 

as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full
would not rise early we held a little council </s>
<s>  a short one for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find </s>
<s>  so
they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a
house </s>
<s>  thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles </s>
<s>  it
was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galleyfire smoking
and flaring looked like a comfortable home </s>
<s>  the night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning </s>
<s>  and what light we had seemed
to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars </s>
<s> 

at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed </s>
<s>  as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore </s>
<s>  and whenever such a sound came one or
other of us was sure to start and look in that direction </s>
<s>  here and
there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them
nervously </s>
<s>  sometimes what was that ripple </s>
<s>  one of us would say in a
low voice </s>
<s>  or another is that a boat yonder </s>
<s>  and afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels </s>
<s> 

at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by </s>
<s>  leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light
to be in a window of a publichouse </s>
<s>  it was a dirty place enough and i
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers </s>
<s>  but there was a good
fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various
liquors to drink </s>
<s>  also there were two doublebedded roomssuch as
they were the landlord said </s>
<s>  no other company was in the house than
the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the
little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been lowwater
mark too </s>
<s> 

with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came
ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boathook and all
else and hauled her up for the night </s>
<s>  we made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms </s>
<s>  herbert and startop
were to occupy one </s>
<s>  i and our charge the other </s>
<s>  we found the air as
carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life </s>
<s>  and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have
thought the family possessed </s>
<s>  but we considered ourselves well off
notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found </s>
<s> 

while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the
jackwho was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as
interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared
galley going up with the tide </s>
<s>  when i told him no he said she must have
gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there </s>
<s> 

they must ha thought better ont for some reason or another said the
jack and gone down </s>
<s> 

a fouroared galley did you say </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

a four said the jack and two sitters </s>
<s> 

did they come ashore here </s>
<s> 

they put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer </s>
<s>  id ha been
glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling
physic in it </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s> 

i know why said the jack </s>
<s>  he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud
had washed into his throat </s>
<s> 

he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye
who seemed to rely greatly on his jackhe thinks they was what they
wasnt </s>
<s> 

i knows what i thinks observed the jack </s>
<s> 

you thinks custum �us jack </s>
<s>  said the landlord </s>
<s> 

i do said the jack </s>
<s> 

then youre wrong jack </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s> 

in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into
it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on
again </s>
<s>  he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could
afford to do anything </s>
<s> 

why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then
jack </s>
<s>  asked the landlord vacillating weakly </s>
<s> 

done with their buttons </s>
<s>  returned the jack </s>
<s>  chucked �em overboard </s>
<s> 
swallered �em </s>
<s>  sowed �em to come up small salad </s>
<s>  done with their
buttons </s>
<s> 

dont be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and
pathetic way </s>
<s> 

a custum �us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they
comes betwixt him and his own light </s>
<s>  a four and two sitters dont go
hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both
with and against another without there being custum �us at the bottom
of it </s>
<s>  saying which he went out in disdain </s>
<s>  and the landlord having no
one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject </s>
<s> 

this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy </s>
<s>  the dismal wind
was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and
i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened </s>
<s>  a fouroared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that i could not get rid of </s>
<s>  when i had induced provis to
go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this
time knew the state of the case and held another council </s>
<s>  whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamers time which would
be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the
morning was the question we discussed </s>
<s>  on the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the
steamers time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with
the tide </s>
<s>  having settled to do this we returned into the house and went
to bed </s>
<s> 

i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a
few hours </s>
<s>  when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house
the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled
me </s>
<s>  rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the
window </s>
<s>  it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw
two men looking into her </s>
<s>  they passed by under the window looking at
nothing else and they did not go down to the landingplace which i
could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the nore </s>
<s> 

my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going
away </s>
<s>  but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day
than i and were fatigued i forbore </s>
<s>  going back to my window i could
see the two men moving over the marsh </s>
<s>  in that light however i soon
lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and
fell asleep again </s>
<s> 

we were up early </s>
<s>  as we walked to and fro all four together before
breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen </s>
<s>  again our
charge was the least anxious of the party </s>
<s>  it was very likely that the
men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no
thought of us </s>
<s>  i tried to persuade myself that it was soas indeed
it might easily be </s>
<s>  however i proposed that he and i should walk away
together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take
us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about
noon </s>
<s>  this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he
and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern </s>
<s> 

he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder </s>
<s>  one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger
not he and that he was reassuring me </s>
<s>  we spoke very little </s>
<s>  as we
approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while
i went on to reconnoitre </s>
<s>  for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night </s>
<s>  he complied and i went on alone </s>
<s>  there was no boat off
the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there </s>
<s>  but to be sure the tide was
high and there might have been some footpints under water </s>
<s> 

when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i
waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited </s>
<s> 
sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round </s>
<s>  we got
aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer </s>
<s>  by that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one oclock and we began to look out for
her smoke </s>
<s> 

but it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer </s>
<s>  as they were coming on
at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity
of saying goodbye to herbert and startop </s>
<s>  we had all shaken hands
cordially and neither herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry when i
saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us and row out into the same track </s>
<s> 

a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamers smoke
by reason of the bend and wind of the river </s>
<s>  but now she was visible
coming head on </s>
<s>  i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide
that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit
quite still wrapped in his cloak </s>
<s>  he answered cheerily trust to me
dear boy and sat like a statue </s>
<s>  meantime the galley which was very
skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen
alongside </s>
<s>  leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept
alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled </s>
<s>  of the two sitters one held the rudderlines and looked at us
attentivelyas did all the rowers </s>
<s>  the other sitter was wrapped up
much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he looked at us </s>
<s>  not a word was spoken in either boat </s>
<s> 

startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first
and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face </s>
<s> 
she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder
and louder </s>
<s>  i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the
galley hailed us </s>
<s>  i answered </s>
<s> 

you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines </s>
<s> 
thats the man wrapped in the cloak </s>
<s>  his name is abel magwitch
otherwise provis </s>
<s>  i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender
and you to assist </s>
<s> 

at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew
he ran the galley abroad of us </s>
<s>  they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead
had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to
our gunwale before we knew what they were doing </s>
<s>  this caused great
confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and
heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt
her driving down upon us irresistibly </s>
<s>  in the same moment i saw the
steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoners shoulder and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically </s>
<s>  still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start
up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley </s>
<s>  still in the same moment i saw that the
face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago </s>
<s>  still in
the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer
and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me </s>
<s> 

it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand
millweirs and a thousand flashes of light </s>
<s>  that instant past i was
taken on board the galley </s>
<s>  herbert was there and startop was there </s>
<s>  but
our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone </s>
<s> 

what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of
her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore </s>
<s>  but the crew of the
galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern </s>
<s>  presently a dark object was seen in it
bearing towards us on the tide </s>
<s>  no man spoke but the steersman held up
his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and
true before it </s>
<s>  as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming
but not swimming freely </s>
<s>  he was taken on board and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles </s>
<s> 

the galley was kept steady and the silent eager lookout at the water
was resumed </s>
<s>  but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not
understanding what had happened came on at speed </s>
<s>  by the time she had
been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water </s>
<s>  the lookout was
kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone </s>
<s>  but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now </s>
<s> 

at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise </s>
<s>  here
i was able to get some comforts for magwitchprovis no longerwho
had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the
head </s>
<s> 

he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising </s>
<s>  the injury to
his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought
he had received against the side of the galley </s>
<s>  he added that he did not
pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but
that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him
that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone
overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of
our boat and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it had capsized
us </s>
<s>  he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each others arms and that there had been a struggle under water and
that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away </s>
<s> 

i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me </s>
<s> 
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard </s>
<s> 

when i asked this officers permission to change the prisoners
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the
publichouse he gave it readily </s>
<s>  merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him </s>
<s>  so the pocketbook
which had once been in my hands passed into the officers </s>
<s>  he further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london </s>
<s>  but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends </s>
<s> 

the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore </s>
<s>  his interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on </s>
<s>  probably it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely </s>
<s>  and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
various stages of decay </s>
<s> 

we remained at the publichouse until the tide turned and then magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board </s>
<s>  herbert and startop
were to get to london by land as soon as they could </s>
<s>  we had a doleful
parting and when i took my place by magwitchs side i felt that that
was my place henceforth while he lived </s>
<s> 

for now my repugnance to him had all melted away </s>
<s>  and in the hunted
wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately
gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a
series of years </s>
<s>  i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to
joe </s>
<s> 

his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on
and often he could not repress a groan </s>
<s>  i tried to rest him on the arm
i could use in any easy position </s>
<s>  but it was dreadful to think that
i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was
unquestionably best that he should die </s>
<s>  that there were still living
people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not
doubt </s>
<s>  that he would be leniently treated i could not hope </s>
<s>  he who had
been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken
prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his arrest </s>
<s> 

as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how
grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake </s>
<s> 

dear boy he answered im quite content to take my chance </s>
<s>  ive seen
my boy and he can be a gentleman without me </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i had thought about that while we had been there side by side </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmicks hint now </s>
<s> 
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to
the crown </s>

lookee here dear boy said he its best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now </s>

<s> 

i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be
near you </s>
<s>  please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me </s>
<s> 

i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his
throatsoftened now like all the rest of him </s>
<s>  it was a good thing
that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not
otherwise have thought of until too latethat he need never know how
his hopes of enriching me had perished </s>

chapter lv

he was taken to the police court next day and would have been
immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped to
speak to his identity </s>
<s>  nobody doubted it </s>
<s>  but compeyson who had meant
to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give
the required evidence </s>
<s>  i had gone direct to <abvr> jaggers at his private
house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and <abvr>
jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing </s>
<s>  it was the sole
resource </s>
<s>  for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us </s>
<s> 

i imparted to <abvr> jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
fate of his wealth </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialize
by and by and try at all events for some of it </s>
<s>  but he did not conceal
from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them </s>
<s>  i understood that very well </s>
<s>  i was not related to the
outlaw or connected with him by any recognizable tie </s>
<s>  he had put his
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension
and to do so now would be idle </s>
<s>  i had no claim and i finally resolved
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one </s>
<s> 

there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of magwitchs affairs </s>
<s>  when his body was found many
miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he
was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets notes were still
legible folded in a case he carried </s>
<s>  among these were the name of a
bankinghouse in new south wales where a sum of money was and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value </s>
<s>  both these heads of
information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to <abvr>
jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit </s>
<s>  his ignorance
poor fellow at last served him </s>
<s>  he never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe with <abvr> jaggerss aid </s>
<s> 

after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prisonship the witness
came and completed the easy case </s>
<s>  he was committed to take his trial at
the next sessions which would come on in a month </s>
<s> 

it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one
evening a good deal cast down and said

his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he
thought </s>

i have not leisure to think of that said i </s>
<s>  you know that i am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i
should be with him all day long if i could </s>
<s>  and when i come away from
him you know that my thoughts are with him </s>
<s> 

the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both
of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words </s>
<s> 

my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our
separationfor it is very nearbe my justification for troubling you
about yourself </s>
<s>  have you thought of your future </s>
<s> 

no for i have been afraid to think of any future </s>
<s> 

but yours cannot be dismissed </s>
<s>  indeed my dear dear handel it must not
be dismissed </s>
<s>  i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly
words go with me </s>
<s> 

i will said i </s>
<s> 

in this branch house of ours handel we must have a

i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a
clerk </s>
<s> 

a clerk </s>
<s>  and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner </s>
<s>  now
handelin short my dear boy will you come to me </s>
<s> 

there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone
stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy </s>
<s> 

clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued
and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in
her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come
together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her
husbands friend that he is her friend too </s>
<s>  we should get on so well
handel </s>
<s> 

i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not
yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered </s>
<s>  firstly my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly </s>
<s> 
secondlyyes </s>
<s>  secondly there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative </s>
<s> 

but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury
to your business leave the question open for a little while

for any while cried herbert </s>
<s>  six months a year </s>
<s> 

not so long as that said i </s>
<s>  two or three months at most </s>
<s> 

herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week </s>
<s> 

and clara </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts </s>
<s>  but he wont last long </s>
<s>  <abvr> whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going </s>
<s> 

not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go </s>
<s> 

i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert </s>
<s>  and then i shall
come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i
will walk quietly into the nearest church </s>
<s>  remember </s>
<s>  the blessed darling
comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book
and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa </s>
<s>  what a fortune for the son of
my mother </s>
<s> 

on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbertfull
of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave meas he sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches </s>
<s>  i went into a coffeehouse to write a little note
to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and
over again and then went to my lonely homeif it deserved the name </s>
<s> 
for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere </s>
<s> 

on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an
unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door </s>
<s>  i had not seen him
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight </s>
<s>  and he had
come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure </s>
<s> 

the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted </s>
<s>  and it was from
the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being
always in trouble that i heard what i did </s>
<s>  i kept my ears open seeming
to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt </s>
<s>  i can only suppose now
that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to
deceive his own instruments </s>
<s>  you dont blame me i hope <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i am
sure i tried to serve you with all my heart </s>
<s> 

i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you very much </s>
<s>  its a bad job said wemmick
scratching his head and i assure you i havent been so cut up for a
long time </s>
<s>  what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property </s>
<s> 
dear me </s>
<s> 

what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property </s>
<s> 

yes to be sure said wemmick </s>
<s>  of course there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him and id put down a fivepound note myself
to get him out of it </s>
<s>  but what i look at is this </s>
<s>  the late compeyson
having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being
so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been
saved </s>
<s>  whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved </s>
<s> 
thats the difference between the property and the owner dont you
see </s>
<s> 

i invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to walworth </s>
<s>  he accepted the invitation </s>
<s>  while he
was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to
it and after having appeared rather fidgety

what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months </s>
<s> 

these twelve years more likely said wemmick </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  im going to take
a holiday </s>
<s>  more than that </s>
<s>  im going to take a walk </s>
<s>  more than that </s>
<s>  im
going to ask you to take a walk with me </s>
<s> 

i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then
when wemmick anticipated me </s>
<s> 

i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s>  but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness </s>
<s> 
it aint a long walk and its an early one </s>
<s>  say it might occupy you
including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve </s>
<s>  couldnt you
stretch a point and manage it </s>
<s> 

he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little
to do for him </s>
<s>  i said i could manage itwould manage itand he was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too </s>
<s>  at his
particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half
past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time </s>
<s> 

punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday
morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking
tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on </s>
<s>  within there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits </s>
<s>  the aged must have
been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his
bedroom i observed that his bed was empty </s>
<s> 

when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was
considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishingrod and put
it over his shoulder </s>
<s>  why we are not going fishing </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  no
 returned wemmick but i like to walk with one </s>
<s> 

i thought this odd </s>
<s>  however i said nothing and we set off </s>
<s>  we went
towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said
suddenly

halloa </s>
<s>  heres a church </s>
<s> 

there was nothing very surprising in that </s>
<s>  but again i was rather
surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea

lets go in </s>
<s> 

we went in wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch and looked all
round </s>
<s>  in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coatpockets and
getting something out of paper there </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  heres a couple of pair of gloves </s>
<s>  lets put �em
on </s>
<s> 

as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the postoffice was widened
to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions </s>
<s>  they
were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side
door escorting a lady </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  heres miss skiffins </s>
<s>  lets have a wedding </s>
<s> 

that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white </s>
<s>  the
aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of hymen </s>
<s>  the old gentleman however experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe
resistance </s>
<s>  by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to
perfection </s>
<s> 

the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails </s>
<s>  true to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of
his waistcoatpocket before the service began halloa </s>
<s>  heres a ring </s>
<s> 

i acted in the capacity of backer or bestman to the bridegroom </s>
<s>  while
a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babys made a feint
of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  the responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergymans being
unintentionally scandalized and it happened thus </s>
<s>  when he said who
giveth this woman to be married to this man </s>
<s>  the old gentleman not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments </s>
<s>  upon which the clergyman
said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man </s>
<s>  the old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the
bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p </s>
<s>  you know </s>
<s>  who
giveth </s>
<s>  to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying
that he gave all right john all right my boy </s>
<s>  and the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day </s>
<s> 

it was completely done however and when we were going out of church
wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and
put the cover on again </s>
<s>  <abvr> wemmick more heedful of the future put
her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green </s>
<s>  now <abvr> pip
 said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came
out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
weddingparty </s>
<s> 

breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green </s>
<s>  and there was a bagatelle
board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity </s>
<s>  it was pleasant to observe that <abvr> wemmick no longer
unwound wemmicks arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a
highbacked chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done </s>
<s> 

we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on
table wemmick said provided by contract you know </s>
<s>  dont be afraid of
it </s>
<s>  i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle
saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could </s>
<s> 

wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him
and wished him joy </s>
<s> 

thankee </s>
<s>  said wemmick rubbing his hands </s>
<s>  shes such a manager
of fowls you have no idea </s>
<s>  you shall have some eggs and judge for
yourself </s>
<s>  i say <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  calling me back and speaking low </s>
<s>  this is
altogether a walworth sentiment please </s>
<s> 

i understand </s>
<s>  not to be mentioned in little britain said i </s>
<s> 

wemmick nodded </s>
<s>  after what you let out the other day <abvr> jaggers
may as well not know of it </s>
<s>  he might think my brain was softening or
something of the kind </s>

chapter lvi

he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions </s>
<s>  he had broken
two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty which increased daily </s>
<s>  it was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible </s>
<s>  therefore he spoke
very little </s>
<s>  but he was ever ready to listen to me </s>
<s>  and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he
ought to hear </s>
<s> 

being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after
the first day or so into the infirmary </s>
<s>  this gave me opportunities
of being with him that i could not otherwise have had </s>
<s>  and but for
his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a
determined prisonbreaker and i know not what else </s>
<s> 

although i saw him every day it was for only a short time </s>
<s>  hence the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state </s>
<s>  i
do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better </s>
<s>  he
wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day
when the prison door closed upon him </s>
<s> 

the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
who was tired out </s>
<s>  i sometimes derived an impression from his manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered
over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
circumstances </s>
<s>  but he never justified himself by a hint tending that
way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape </s>
<s> 

it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him </s>
<s>  a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with
a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small
redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child </s>
<s> 
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him
complain </s>
<s> 

when the sessions came round <abvr> jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions </s>
<s>  it
was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long
and was refused </s>
<s>  the trial came on at once and when he was put to the
bar he was seated in a chair </s>
<s>  no objection was made to my getting
close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he
stretched forth to me </s>
<s> 

the trial was very short and very clear </s>
<s>  such things as could be said
for him were saidhow he had taken to industrious habits and had
thriven lawfully and reputably </s>
<s>  but nothing could unsay the fact that
he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury </s>
<s>  it was
impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty </s>
<s> 

at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience
of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of
sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death </s>
<s> 
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me
i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw
twoandthirty men and women put before the judge to receive that
sentence together </s>
<s>  foremost among the twoandthirty was he </s>
<s>  seated
that he might get breath enough to keep life in him </s>
<s> 

the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment down
to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in
the rays of april sun </s>
<s>  penned in the dock as i again stood outside it
at the corner with his hand in mine were the twoandthirty men
and women </s>
<s>  some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and
weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about </s>
<s>  there
had been shrieks from among the women convicts </s>
<s>  but they had been
stilled and a hush had succeeded </s>
<s>  the sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great
gallery full of peoplea large theatrical audiencelooked on as the
twoandthirty and the judge were solemnly confronted </s>
<s>  then the judge
addressed them </s>
<s>  among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
been an offender against the laws </s>
<s>  who after repeated imprisonments and
punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years </s>
<s> 
and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his
escape and been resentenced to exile for life </s>
<s>  that miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed
from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life </s>
<s>  but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and
passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to
society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had
come back to the country where he was proscribed </s>
<s>  being here presently
denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had
resisted them and hadhe best knew whether by express design or in
the blindness of his hardihoodcaused the death of his denouncer to
whom his whole career was known </s>
<s>  the appointed punishment for his return
to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this
aggravated case he must prepare himself to die </s>
<s> 

the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of
light between the twoandthirty and the judge linking both together
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on
with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things
and cannot err </s>
<s>  rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this
way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence
of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again </s>
<s> 
there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say
to the rest </s>
<s>  then they were all formally doomed and some of them were
supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about </s>
<s>  he went last of all because of having to
be helped from his chair and to go very slowly </s>
<s>  and he held my hand
while all the others were removed and while the audience got up
putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and
pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me </s>
<s> 

i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorders
report was made </s>
<s>  but in the dread of his lingering on i began that
night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting
forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my
sake </s>
<s>  i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could </s>
<s>  and when i
had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the
crown itself </s>
<s>  for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took
no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals </s>
<s>  and after i had sent them in i could not keep away
from the places where they were but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when i was near them </s>
<s>  in this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening
wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions </s>
<s>  to
the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty
spring night with their ranges of stern shutup mansions and their
long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association </s>
<s> 

the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more
strictly kept </s>
<s>  seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down
at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was
willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my
designs </s>
<s>  nobody was hard with him or with me </s>
<s>  there was duty to be
done and it was done but not harshly </s>
<s>  the officer always gave me the
assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the
room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses
malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked </s>
<s>  always
joined in the same report </s>
<s> 

as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would
subside again </s>
<s>  sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then
he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to
understand his meaning very well </s>
<s> 

the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change
in him than i had seen yet </s>
<s>  his eyes were turned towards the door and
lighted up as i entered </s>
<s> 

dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed </s>
<s>  i thought you was late </s>
<s> 
but i knowed you couldnt be that </s>
<s> 

it is just the time said i </s>
<s>  i waited for it at the gate </s>
<s> 

you always waits at the gate </s>
<s>  dont you dear boy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  not to lose a moment of the time </s>
<s> 

thankee dear boy thankee </s>
<s>  god bless you </s>
<s>  youve never deserted me
dear boy </s>
<s> 

i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once
meant to desert him </s>
<s> 

and whats the best of all he said youve been more comfortable
alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone </s>
<s> 
thats best of all </s>
<s> 

he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty </s>
<s>  do what he would
and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling </s>
<s> 

are you in much pain today </s>
<s> 

i dont complain of none dear boy </s>
<s> 

you never do complain </s>
<s> 

he had spoken his last words </s>
<s>  he smiled and i understood his touch to
mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast </s>
<s>  i laid it
there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it </s>
<s> 

the allotted time ran out while we were thus </s>
<s>  but looking round i
found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered
you neednt go yet </s>
<s>  i thanked him gratefully and asked might i
speak to him if he can hear me </s>
<s> 

the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away </s>
<s>  the change
though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me </s>
<s> 

dear magwitch i must tell you now at last </s>
<s>  you understand what i
say </s>
<s> 

a gentle pressure on my hand </s>
<s> 

you had a child once whom you loved and lost </s>
<s> 

a stronger pressure on my hand </s>
<s> 

she lived and found powerful friends </s>
<s>  she is living now </s>
<s>  she is a lady
and very beautiful </s>
<s>  and i love her </s>
<s> 

with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips </s>
<s>  then
he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on
it </s>
<s>  the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and
his head dropped quietly on his breast </s>
<s> 

mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men
who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better
words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him
a sinner </s>
<s> 




chapter lvii

now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them </s>
<s>  at once i put bills
up in the windows </s>
<s>  for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs </s>
<s>  i ought
rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that i was falling very ill </s>
<s>  the late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away </s>
<s>  i knew that it
was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless
as to that </s>
<s> 

for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the flooranywhere
according as i happened to sink downwith a heavy head and aching
limbs and no purpose and no power </s>
<s>  then there came one night which
appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror </s>
<s> 
and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i
found i could not do so </s>
<s> 

whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night
groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there </s>
<s>  whether i had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror
not knowing how i had got out of bed </s>
<s>  whether i had found myself
lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up
the stairs and that the lights were blown out </s>
<s>  whether i had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning
of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making </s>
<s> 
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss
havisham was consuming within itthese were things that i tried to
settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on
my bed </s>
<s>  but the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them
disordering them all and it was through the vapor at last that i saw
two men looking at me </s>
<s> 

what do you want </s>
<s>  i asked starting </s>
<s>  i dont know you </s>
<s> 

well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the
shoulder this is a matter that youll soon arrange i dare say but
youre arrested </s>
<s> 

what is the debt </s>
<s> 

hundred and twentythree pound fifteen six </s>
<s>  jewellers account i
think </s>
<s> 

what is to be done </s>
<s> 

you had better come to my house said the man </s>
<s>  i keep a very nice
house </s>
<s> 

i made some attempt to get up and dress myself </s>
<s>  when i next attended
to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me </s>

still lay there </s>

you see my state said i </s>
<s>  i would come with you if i could </s>
<s>  but
indeed i am quite unable </s>
<s>  if you take me from here i think i shall die
by the way </s>
<s> 

perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to
believe that i was better than i thought </s>
<s>  forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread i dont know what they did
except that they forbore to remove me </s>
<s> 

that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that
i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i
confounded impossible existences with my own identity </s>
<s>  that i was a
brick in the housewall and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me </s>
<s>  that i was a steel beam of a
vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered
off </s>
<s>  that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own
remembrance and did in some sort know at the time </s>
<s>  that i sometimes
struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and
that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and
would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me
down i also knew at the time </s>
<s>  but above all i knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these peoplewho when i was very ill would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face

was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to
settle down into the likeness of joe </s>

after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that
while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did
not change </s>
<s>  whoever came about me still settled down into joe </s>
<s>  i opened
my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe </s>
<s> 
i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the windowseat smoking
his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe </s>
<s>  i asked for cooling
drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joes </s>
<s>  i sank back on
my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of joe </s>
<s> 

at last one day i took courage and said is it joe </s>
<s> 

and the dear old homevoice answered which it air old chap </s>
<s> 

o joe you break my heart </s>
<s>  look angry at me joe </s>
<s>  strike me joe </s>
<s>  tell
me of my ingratitude </s>
<s>  dont be so good to me </s>
<s> 

for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and
put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him </s>
<s> 

which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends </s>
<s> 
and when youre well enough to go out for a ridewhat larks </s>
<s> 

after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards
me wiping his eyes </s>
<s>  and as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god
bless him </s>
<s>  o god bless this gentle christian man </s>
<s> 

joes eyes were red when i next found him beside me </s>
<s>  but i was holding
his hand and we both felt happy </s>
<s> 

how long dear joe </s>
<s> 

which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old
chap </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s> 

its the end of may pip </s>
<s>  tomorrow is the first of june </s>
<s> 

and have you been here all that time dear joe </s>
<s> 

pretty nigh old chap </s>
<s>  for as i says to biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and
being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoeleather but wealth were not a object on his part and
marriage were the great wish of his hart

it is so delightful to hear you joe </s>
<s>  but i interrupt you in what you
said to biddy </s>
<s> 

which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and
that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble </s>
<s>  and biddy her word were �go to him
without loss of time </s>
<s>  that said joe summing up with his judicial
air were the word of biddy </s>
<s>  �go to him biddy say �without loss of
time </s>
<s>  in short i shouldnt greatly deceive you joe added after a
little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that
young woman were �without a minutes loss of time </s>
<s> 

there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked
to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that
i was to submit myself to all his orders </s>
<s>  so i kissed his hand and lay
quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it </s>
<s> 

evidently biddy had taught joe to write </s>
<s>  as i lay in bed looking at him
it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter </s>
<s>  my bedstead divested of its
curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sittingroom as
the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day </s>
<s>  at my own
writingtable pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles
joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the
pentray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his
sleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer </s>
<s>  it was
necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow
and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin </s>
<s>  and
when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen
spluttering extensively </s>
<s>  he had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into
space and seemed quite satisfied with the result </s>
<s>  occasionally he was
tripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock </s>
<s>  but on the whole
he got on very well indeed </s>
<s>  and when he had signed his name and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with
his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the
effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there
with unbounded satisfaction </s>
<s> 

not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to
talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day </s>
<s>  he
shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered </s>
<s> 

is she dead joe </s>
<s> 

why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way
of getting at it by degrees i wouldnt go so far as to say that for
thats a deal to say </s>
<s>  but she aint

living joe </s>
<s> 

thats nigher where it is said joe </s>
<s>  she aint living </s>
<s> 

did she linger long joe </s>
<s> 

arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you
was put to it a week said joe </s>
<s>  still determined on my account to
come at everything by degrees </s>
<s> 

dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property </s>
<s> 

well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most
of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella </s>
<s>  but she had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the
accident leaving a cool four thousand to <abvr> matthew pocket </s>
<s>  and why
do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand
unto him </s>
<s>  �because of pips account of him the said matthew </s>
<s>  i am told
by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as
if it did him infinite good �account of him the said matthew </s>
<s>  and a
cool four thousand pip </s>
<s> 

i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds </s>
<s>  but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool </s>
<s> 

this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i
had done </s>
<s>  i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies </s>
<s> 

miss sarah said joe she have twentyfive pound perannium fur to
buy pills on account of being bilious </s>
<s>  miss georgiana she have twenty
pound down </s>
<s>  <abvr>whats the name of them wild beasts with humps old
chap </s>
<s> 

camels </s>
<s>  said i wondering why he could possibly want to know </s>
<s> 

joe nodded </s>
<s>  <abvr> camels by which i presently understood he meant
camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in
spirits when she wake up in the night </s>
<s> 

the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give
me great confidence in joes information </s>
<s>  and now said joe you
aint that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful today </s>
<s>  old orlick hes been a bustin open a
dwellingouse </s>
<s> 

whose </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said
joe apologetically </s>
<s>  still a englishmans ouse is his castle and
castles must not be busted �cept when done in war time </s>
<s>  and wotsumeer
the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart </s>
<s> 

is it pumblechooks house that has been broken into then </s>
<s> 

thats it pip said joe </s>
<s>  and they took his till and they took his
cashbox and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles
and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him
up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out </s>
<s>  but he knowed
orlick and orlicks in the county jail </s>
<s> 

by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation </s>
<s>  i was slow
to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe
stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again </s>
<s> 

for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need
that i was like a child in his hands </s>
<s>  he would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive
protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone </s>
<s>  he did everything for me except the household work for which
he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on
his first arrival </s>
<s>  which i do assure you pip he would often say in
explanation of that liberty </s>
<s>  i found her a tapping the spare bed like
a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale </s>
<s> 
which she would have tapped yourn next and drawd it off with you a
laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the souptureen and wegetabledishes and the wine and spirits in your
wellington boots </s>
<s> 

we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship </s>
<s>  and when the day
came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up
took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were
still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his great nature </s>
<s> 

and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass
and sweet summer scents filled all the air </s>
<s>  the day happened to be
sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought
how it had grown and changed and how the little wildflowers had been
forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and
by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning
and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace </s>
<s>  but when i heard the sunday
bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt
that i was not nearly thankful enoughthat i was too weak yet to be
even thatand i laid my head on joes shoulder as i had laid it long
ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much
for my young senses </s>
<s> 

more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used
to talk lying on the grass at the old battery </s>
<s>  there was no change
whatever in joe </s>
<s>  exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my
eyes still </s>
<s>  just as simply faithful and as simply right </s>
<s> 

when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried meso
easily </s>
<s> across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful
christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes </s>
<s>  we had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of
my late history he was acquainted with </s>
<s>  i was so doubtful of myself now
and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i
ought to refer to it when he did not </s>
<s> 

have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further
consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was </s>
<s> 

i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap </s>
<s> 

did you hear who it was joe </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you
the banknotes at the jolly bargemen pip </s>
<s> 

so it was </s>
<s> 

astonishing </s>
<s>  said joe in the placidest way </s>
<s> 

did you hear that he was dead joe </s>
<s>  i presently asked with increasing
diffidence </s>
<s> 

which </s>
<s>  him as sent the banknotes pip </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather
evasively at the windowseat as i did hear tell that how he were
something or another in a general way in that direction </s>
<s> 

did you hear anything of his circumstances joe </s>
<s> 

not partickler pip </s>
<s> 

if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and
came to my sofa </s>
<s> 

lookee here old chap said joe bending over me </s>
<s>  ever the best of
friends </s>
<s>  aint us pip </s>
<s> 

i was ashamed to answer him </s>
<s> 

wery good then said joe as if i had answered </s>
<s>  thats all right </s>
<s> 
thats agreed upon </s>
<s>  then why go into subjects old chap which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary </s>
<s>  theres subjects enough
as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s>  to think of your
poor sister and her rampages </s>
<s>  and dont you remember tickler </s>
<s> 

i do indeed joe </s>
<s> 

lookee here old chap said joe </s>
<s>  i done what i could to keep you
and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations </s>
<s>  for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it
were not so much said joe in his favorite argumentative way that
she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that
she dropped into you always heavier for it </s>
<s>  i noticed that </s>
<s>  it aint a
grab at a mans whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your
sister was quite welcome that �ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment </s>
<s>  but when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up
and says to himself �where is the good as you are a doing </s>
<s>  i grant you
i see the �arm says the man �but i dont see the good </s>
<s>  i call upon
you sir therefore to pint out the good </s>
<s> 

the man says </s>
<s>  i observed as joe waited for me to speak </s>
<s> 

the man says joe assented </s>
<s>  is he right that man </s>
<s> 

dear joe he is always right </s>
<s> 

well old chap said joe then abide by your words </s>
<s>  if hes always
right which in general hes more likely wrong hes right when he says
this </s>
<s>  supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you
was a little child you kep it mostly because you knowd as j </s>
<s>  gargerys
power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations </s>
<s>  theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects </s>
<s>  biddy giv herself a
deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i
should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should
so put it </s>
<s>  both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical
arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say </s>
<s>  namely </s>
<s> 
you mustnt go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your
wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets </s>
<s> 

the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and
kindness with which biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so
soonhad prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind </s>
<s>  but
whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had
all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not
understand </s>
<s> 

another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to
develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of was this </s>
<s>  as i became stronger and better joe became a little less
easy with me </s>
<s>  in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names
the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears </s>
<s>  i too had
fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me </s>
<s>  but
imperceptibly though i held by them fast joes hold upon them began
to slacken </s>
<s>  and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was
all mine </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that
in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off </s>
<s>  had i given
joes innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got
stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away </s>
<s> 

it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
temple gardens leaning on joes arm that i saw this change in him very
plainly </s>
<s>  we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the
river and i chanced to say as we got up

see joe </s>
<s>  i can walk quite strongly </s>
<s>  now you shall see me walk back by
myself </s>
<s> 

which do not overdo it pip said joe </s>
<s>  but i shall be happy fur to
see you able sir </s>
<s> 

the last word grated on me </s>
<s>  but how could i remonstrate </s>
<s>  i walked no
further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be
weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm </s>
<s>  joe gave it me but was
thoughtful </s>
<s> 

i for my part was thoughtful too </s>
<s>  for how best to check this growing
change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts </s>
<s>  that i
was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come
down to i do not seek to conceal </s>
<s>  but i hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one </s>
<s>  he would want to help me out of his little
savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i
must not suffer him to do it </s>
<s> 

it was a thoughtful evening with both of us </s>
<s>  but before we went to
bed i had resolved that i would wait over tomorrowtomorrow being
sundayand would begin my new course with the new week </s>
<s>  on monday
morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts
that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go
out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever </s>
<s>  as i
cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too </s>
<s> 

we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and
then walked in the fields </s>
<s> 

i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said </s>
<s> 

dear old pip old chap youre amost come round sir </s>
<s> 

it has been a memorable time for me joe </s>
<s> 

likeways for myself sir joe returned </s>
<s> 

we have had a time together joe that i can never forget </s>
<s>  there were
days once i know that i did for a while forget </s>
<s>  but i never shall
forget these </s>
<s> 

pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has
been larks </s>
<s>  and dear sir what have been betwixt ushave been </s>
<s> 

at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done
all through my recovery </s>
<s>  he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well
as in the morning </s>
<s> 

yes dear joe quite </s>
<s> 

and are always a getting stronger old chap </s>
<s> 

yes dear joe steadily </s>
<s> 

joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and
said in what i thought a husky voice good night </s>
<s> 

when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of
my resolution to tell joe all without delay </s>
<s>  i would tell him before
breakfast </s>
<s>  i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him </s>
<s> 
for it was the first day i had been up early </s>
<s>  i went to his room and
he was not there </s>
<s>  not only was he not there but his box was gone </s>
<s> 

i hurried then to the breakfasttable and on it found a letter </s>
<s>  these
were its brief contents </s>
<s> 

not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear
pip and will do better without jo </s>
<s> 

p </s>
<s> s </s>
<s>  ever the best of friends </s>
<s> 

enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i
had been arrested </s>
<s>  down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite
recovered </s>
<s>  i had never dreamed of joes having paid the money </s>
<s>  but joe
had paid it and the receipt was in his name </s>
<s> 

what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and
there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance
with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts
and had formed into a settled purpose </s>
<s> 

the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how
humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost
all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time </s>
<s>  then i would say to her biddy i think you once
liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away
from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since </s>
<s> 
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like
a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier
of you that i wasnot much but a little </s>
<s>  and biddy it shall rest
with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i
shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer </s>
<s>  and now
dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man
for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you </s>
<s> 

such was my purpose </s>
<s>  after three days more of recovery i went down to
the old place to put it in execution </s>
<s>  and how i sped in it is all i have
left to tell </s>
<s> 




chapter lviii

the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before i got there </s>
<s>  i found the
blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a
great change in the boars demeanour </s>
<s>  whereas the boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property
the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of
property </s>
<s> 

it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so
often made so easily </s>
<s>  the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom
which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
postchaises up the yard </s>
<s>  but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom </s>
<s> 

early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled
round by satis house </s>
<s>  there were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of
the household furniture and effects next week </s>
<s>  the house itself was to
be sold as old building materials and pulled down </s>
<s>  lot  was marked in
whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house </s>
<s>  lot  on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up </s>
<s>  other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already </s>
<s>  stepping in for a moment at the open gate and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there i saw the auctioneers clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler pen in
hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often
pushed along to the tune of old clem </s>
<s> 

when i got back to my breakfast in the boars coffeeroom i found <abvr>
pumblechook conversing with the landlord </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook not improved
in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and
addressed me in the following terms </s>
<s> 

young man i am sorry to see you brought low </s>
<s>  but what else could be
expected </s>
<s>  what else could be expected </s>
<s> 

as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it </s>

william said <abvr> pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table </s>
<s> 
and has it come to this </s>
<s>  has it come to this </s>
<s> 

i frowningly sat down to my breakfast </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my teabefore i could touch the teapotwith the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last </s>

william said <abvr> pumblechook mournfully put the salt on </s>

happier times addressing me i think you took sugar </s>

<s>  william bring a watercress </s>
<s> 

thank you said i shortly but i dont eat watercresses </s>
<s> 

you dont eat �em returned <abvr> pumblechook sighing and nodding
his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall </s>
<s>  true </s>
<s> 
the simple fruits of the earth </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  you neednt bring any william </s>
<s> 

i went on with my breakfast and <abvr> pumblechook continued to stand over
me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did </s>
<s> 

little more than skin and bone </s>
<s>  mused <abvr> pumblechook aloud </s>
<s>  and yet
when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore
him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach </s>
<s> 

this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i </s>
<s> 
 and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  he went on handing me the bread and butter </s>

to joseph </s>
<s> 

in heavens name said i firing in spite of myself what does it
matter to you where i am going </s>
<s>  leave that teapot alone </s>

it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook
the opportunity he wanted </s>
<s> 

yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in
question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot
alone </s>
<s>  you are right young man </s>
<s>  for once you are right </s>
<s>  i forgit myself
when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated

pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at
arms length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy
infancy </s>
<s>  tell me not it cannot be </s>
<s>  i tell you this is him </s>

a low murmur from the two replied </s>

particularly affected </s>

this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shaycart </s>

the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave
the case a black look </s>

young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old
fashion you air a going to joseph </s>

ask me where you air a going </s>
<s>  i say to you sir you air a going to
joseph </s>

the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that </s>

now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph </s>

chapter lix

for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily
eyesthough they had both been often before my fancy in the
eastwhen upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door </s>
<s>  i touched it
so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen </s>
<s>  there smoking his
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as
ever though a little gray sat joe </s>
<s>  and there fenced into the corner
with joes leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire
wasi again </s>
<s> 

we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe
delighted when i took another stool by the childs side but i did not
rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and
we think he do </s>
<s> 

i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we
talked immensely understanding one another to perfection </s>
<s>  and i took
him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife
of the above </s>
<s> 

biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl
lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days </s>
<s>  or
lend him at all events </s>
<s> 

no no said biddy gently </s>
<s>  you must marry </s>
<s> 

so herbert and clara say but i dont think i shall biddy </s>
<s>  i have so
settled down in their home that its not at all likely </s>
<s>  i am already
quite an old bachelor </s>
<s> 

biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and
then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine </s>
<s> 
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddys
weddingring that had a very pretty eloquence in it </s>
<s> 

dear pip said biddy you are sure you dont fret for her </s>
<s> 

o noi think not biddy </s>
<s> 

tell me as an old old friend </s>
<s>  have you quite forgotten her </s>
<s> 

my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there and little that ever had any place there </s>
<s>  but that
poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddyall gone
by </s>
<s> 

nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake </s>
<s> 
yes even so </s>
<s>  for estellas sake </s>
<s> 

i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being
separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality
and meanness </s>
<s>  and i had heard of the death of her husband from an
accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse </s>
<s>  this release had
befallen her some two years before </s>
<s>  for anything i knew she was married
again </s>
<s> 

the early dinner hour at joes left me abundance of time without
hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark </s>
<s> 
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place </s>
<s> 

there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the
wall of the old garden </s>
<s>  the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin </s>
<s>  a gate in
the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in </s>
<s> 

a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it </s>
<s>  but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the
moon was coming and the evening was not dark </s>
<s>  i could trace out where
every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been
and where the gates and where the casks </s>
<s>  i had done so and was looking
along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it </s>
<s> 

the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced </s>
<s>  it had been moving
towards me but it stood still </s>
<s>  as i drew nearer i saw it to be the
figure of a woman </s>
<s>  as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when
it stopped and let me come up with it </s>
<s>  then it faltered as if much
surprised and uttered my name and i cried out

estella </s>
<s> 

i am greatly changed </s>
<s>  i wonder you know me </s>
<s> 

the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained </s>
<s>  those attractions in it
i had seen before </s>
<s>  what i had never seen before was the saddened
softened light of the once proud eyes </s>
<s>  what i had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand </s>
<s> 

we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years
it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our
first meeting was </s>
<s>  do you often come back </s>
<s> 

i have never been here since </s>
<s> 

nor i </s>
<s> 

the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling which had passed away </s>
<s>  the moon began to rise and i thought of
the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on
earth </s>
<s> 

estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us </s>
<s> 

i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been
prevented by many circumstances </s>
<s>  poor poor old place </s>
<s> 

the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes </s>
<s>  not knowing
that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said
quietly

were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this
condition </s>
<s> 

yes estella </s>
<s> 

the ground belongs to me </s>
<s>  it is the only possession i have not
relinquished </s>
<s>  everything else has gone from me little by little but i
have kept this </s>

made in all the wretched years </s>

<s>  i came here to take leave of it before its change </s>
<s>  and
you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wandereryou

<s> 

still </s>
<s> 

and do well i am sure </s>
<s> 

i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and thereforeyes i do
well </s>
<s> 

i have often thought of you said estella </s>
<s> 

have you </s>
<s> 

of late very often </s>
<s>  there was a long hard time when i kept far from me
the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant
of its worth </s>
<s>  but since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart </s>
<s> 

you have always held your place in my heart i answered </s>
<s> 

and we were silent again until she spoke </s>
<s> 

i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot </s>
<s>  i am very glad to do so </s>
<s> 

glad to part again estella </s>
<s>  to me parting is a painful thing </s>
<s>  to me
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful </s>
<s> 

but you said to me returned estella very earnestly �god bless you
god forgive you </s>
<s>  and if you could say that to me then you will not
hesitate to say that to me nownow when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be </s>
<s>  i have been bent and broken buti hopeinto a better
shape </s>
<s>  be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are
friends </s>
<s> 

we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from
the bench </s>
<s> 

and will continue friends apart said estella </s>
<s> 

i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place </s>

the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the
evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her </s>

the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered up
shooters hill </s>
<s>  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail
as the rest of the passengers did </s>
<s>  not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise under the circumstances but because the hill
and the harness and the mud and the mail were all so heavy that the
horses had three times already come to a stop besides once drawing the
coach across the road with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to blackheath </s>
<s>  reins and whip and coachman and guard however in
combination had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animals
are endued with reason </s>
<s>  and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty </s>
<s> 

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way through
the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints </s>
<s>  as often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand with a wary woho </s>
<s>  sohothen </s>
<s>  the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an
unusually emphatic horse denying that the coach could be got up the
hill </s>
<s>  whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a
nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind </s>
<s> 

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding
none </s>
<s>  a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do </s>
<s>  it was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coachlamps but these its own workings
and a few yards of road </s>
<s>  and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it as if they had made it all </s>
<s> 

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail </s>
<s>  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears and wore jackboots </s>
<s>  not one of the three could have said from
anything he saw what either of the other two was like </s>
<s>  and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind as from
the eyes of the body of his two companions </s>
<s>  in those days travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers </s>
<s>  as to the latter
when every postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in
the captains pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
nondescript it was the likeliest thing upon the cards </s>

of the dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters hill as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail beating his feet
and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest before him where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horsepistols
deposited on a substratum of cutlass </s>
<s> 

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers the passengers suspected one another and the guard they
all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses </s>

taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the
journey </s>

yet </s>

suit </s>

passengers squashing along by its side </s>

stopped and they kept close company with it </s>
<s>  if any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman </s>

stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent and open the coachdoor to let the passengers in </s>

been in his own coach and six or his own coach and sixty with the
breadth of a county between him and the next </s>

alehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes </s>

assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface black with
no depth in the colour or form and much too near togetheras if they
were afraid of being found out in something singly if they kept too
far apart </s>

over it and growing down hill almost to his broad blunt nose </s>

so like smiths work so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair that the best of players at leapfrog might
have declined him as the most dangerous man in the world to go over </s>

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness </s>

they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every shadow on the road </s>

its tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside </s>

likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms

tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail </s>

stroke of business </s>

stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a

them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle and found them
safe and strong and sound and still just as he had last seen them </s>
<s> 

but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night </s>

out of a grave </s>

now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him

so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous colour emaciated hands

patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train

roadside destinations </s>

royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it </s>
<s>  consequently another
drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord
and the coffeeroom when a gentleman of sixty formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well kept with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed along on his way to
his breakfast </s>

loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat

evanescence of the brisk fire </s>

fine texture </s>

head </s>

his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea </s>
<s>  a
face habitually suppressed and quieted was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner in years gone by some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of tellsons bank </s>

cheeks and his face though lined bore few traces of anxiety </s>

destruction </s>

a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be

fishing was done in the port and a quantity of strolling about by
night and looking seaward </s>

glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettes apartment </s>

fixed attention though it included all the four expressionsas his

a wildlooking woman whom even in his agitation <abvr> lorry observed to

wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good measure too

<s>  the wineshop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street </s>

accident had happened in getting it out of a cart </s>

out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wineshop shattered like a walnutshell </s>

all the people within reach had suspended their business or their
idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine </s>
<s>  the rough irregular
stones of the street pointing every way and designed one might have
thought expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them
had dammed it into little pools </s>
<s>  these were surrounded each by its own
jostling group or crowd according to its size </s>
<s>  some men kneeled down
made scoops of their two hands joined and sipped or tried to help
women who bent over their shoulders to sip before the wine had all
run out between their fingers </s>
<s>  others men and women dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware or even with
handkerchiefs from womens heads which were squeezed dry into infants
mouths </s>
<s>  others made small mudembankments to stem the wine as it ran </s>
<s> 
others directed by lookerson up at high windows darted here and
there to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions </s>
<s>  others devoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed
pieces of the cask licking and even champing the moister winerotted
fragments with eager relish </s>
<s>  there was no drainage to carry off the
wine and not only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up
along with it that there might have been a scavenger in the street
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence </s>
<s> 

a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men women
and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game lasted </s>
<s>  there
was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness </s>
<s>  there was a
special companionship in it an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one which led especially among the
luckier or lighterhearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of healths
shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing a dozen
together </s>
<s>  when the wine was gone and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by fingers these
demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out </s>

had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting set it in
motion again </s>

hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes or in those of her child returned to it </s>
<s>  men
with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous faces who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars moved away to descend again </s>
<s>  and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine </s>
<s> 

the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilled </s>
<s>  it had
stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many
wooden shoes </s>
<s>  the hands of the man who sawed the wood left red marks
on the billets </s>
<s>  and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again </s>
<s> 
those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth </s>
<s>  and one tall joker so besmirched his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wineleesblood </s>

the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the
streetstones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there </s>

grown faces and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh

of the tall houses in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines </s>
<s>  hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper </s>
<s>  hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off </s>
<s>  hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys and started up from the filthy street that had no offal
among its refuse of anything to eat </s>
<s>  hunger was the inscription on the
bakers shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread </s>

was offered for sale </s>
<s>  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder </s>

farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant
drops of oil </s>

its abiding place was in all things fitted to it </s>
<s>  a narrow winding
street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets

wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at bay </s>

<s>  nor
compressed lips white with what they suppressed </s>
<s>  nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallowsrope they mused about enduring or
inflicting </s>
<s>  the trade signs and they were almost as many as the shops
were all grim illustrations of want </s>
<s>  the butcher and the porkman
painted up only the leanest scrags of meat </s>
<s>  the baker the coarsest of
meagre loaves </s>
<s>  the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wineshops
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer and were
gloweringly confidential together </s>
<s>  nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition save tools and weapons </s>
<s>  but the cutlers knives
and axes were sharp and bright the smiths hammers were heavy and the
gunmakers stock was murderous </s>
<s>  the crippling stones of the pavement
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but
broke off abruptly at the doors </s>
<s>  the kennel to make amends ran down
the middle of the streetwhen it ran at all </s>

rains and then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses </s>

the streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley </s>

and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea </s>

the ship and crew were in peril of tempest </s>
<s> 

for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger so
long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the darkness of their
condition </s>

france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain for the birds fine of
song and feather took no warning </s>

the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stood outside
it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at the struggle

mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it </s>

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally

this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man of thirty

the elbows </s>

eyes and a good bold breadth between them </s>

resolution and a set purpose </s>

came in </s>

have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself

shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large
earrings </s>

her teeth with a toothpick </s>

by her left hand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but
coughed just one grain of cough </s>

of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way </s>

the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in
a corner </s>
<s>  other company were there </s>
<s>  two playing cards two playing
dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine </s>
<s>  as he passed behind the counter he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man </s>
<s> 

what the devil do you do in that galley there </s>
<s>  said monsieur defarge
to himself </s>
<s>  i dont know you </s>
<s> 

but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter </s>
<s> 

how goes it jacques </s>
<s>  said one of these three to monsieur defarge </s>
<s>  is
all the spilt wine swallowed </s>
<s> 

every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge
picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line </s>

it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur
defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or
of anything but black bread and death </s>

it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned </s>
<s> 

at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still
using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of
cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line </s>

the last of the three now said his say as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips </s>

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three
flourishes </s>

giving them a quick look </s>

wineshop took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit and became absorbed in it </s>

gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her good day </s>

they paid for their wine and left the place </s>

defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word </s>

willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to
the door </s>

their conference was very short but very decided </s>

word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive </s>

hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted
the air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their

ay </s>

i think it necessary to turn the key </s>

closer in his ear and frowned heavily </s>

this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word

they went up slowly and softly </s>
<s>  the staircase was short and they were
soon at the top </s>
<s>  there as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at

the three glided by and went silently down </s>
<s> 

there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of
the wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alone <abvr>
lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger </s>
<s> 

do you make a show of monsieur manette </s>
<s> 

i show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few </s>

i think it is well </s>

with an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in
through the crevice in the wall </s>
<s>  soon raising his head again he struck
twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to
make a noise there </s>
<s>  with the same intention he drew the key across it
three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned
it as heavily as he could </s>

the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the
room and said something </s>
<s>  a faint voice answered something </s>
<s>  little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side </s>

he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter </s>

got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held her </s>

<s> 

rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room </s>
<s>  he sat her
down just within the door and held her clinging to him </s>
<s> 

defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside
took out the key again and held it in his hand </s>
<s>  all this he did
methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make </s>
<s>  finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was </s>
<s>  he stopped there and faced round </s>
<s> 

the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim
and dark </s>
<s>  for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the
roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street </s>
<s>  unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any
other door of french construction </s>
<s>  to exclude the cold one half of this
door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way </s>

such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it
was difficult on first coming in to see anything </s>
<s>  and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity </s>
<s>  yet work of that kind was being
done in the garret </s>
<s>  for with his back towards the door and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at
him a whitehaired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very
busy making shoes </s>

vi </s>
<s>  the shoemaker


good day </s>
<s>  said monsieur defarge looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking </s>
<s> 

it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation as if it were at a distance </s>
<s> 

good day </s>
<s> 

you are still hard at work i see </s>
<s> 

after a long silence the head was lifted for another moment and the
voice replied yesi am working </s>
<s>  this time a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again </s>
<s> 

the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful </s>
<s>  it was not the
faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it </s>
<s>  its deplorable peculiarity was that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse </s>
<s>  it was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago </s>
<s>  so entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain </s>
<s>  so sunken and
suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground </s>
<s>  so expressive
it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die </s>
<s> 

some minutes of silent work had passed </s>
<s>  and the haggard eyes had looked
up again </s>
<s>  not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical
perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood was not yet empty </s>
<s> 

i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker
to let in a little more light here </s>
<s>  you can bear a little more </s>
<s> 

the shoemaker stopped his work </s>
<s>  looked with a vacant air of listening
at the floor on one side of him </s>
<s>  then similarly at the floor on the
other side of him </s>
<s>  then upward at the speaker </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

you can bear a little more light </s>
<s> 

i must bear it if you let it in </s>
<s>  laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word </s>
<s> 

the opened halfdoor was opened a little further and secured at that
angle for the time </s>
<s>  a broad ray of light fell into the garret and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his
labour </s>
<s>  his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench </s>
<s>  he had a white beard raggedly cut but not very
long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes </s>
<s>  the hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really
otherwise </s>
<s>  but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so </s>
<s> 
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body
to be withered and worn </s>
<s>  he and his old canvas frock and his loose
stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion
from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchmentyellow that it would have been hard to say which was which </s>
<s> 

he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones
of it seemed transparent </s>
<s>  so he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze
pausing in his work </s>
<s>  he never looked at the figure before him without
first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound </s>
<s>  he never spoke without
first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak </s>
<s> 

are you going to finish that pair of shoes today </s>
<s>  asked defarge
motioning to <abvr> lorry to come forward </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today </s>
<s> 

i cant say that i mean to </s>
<s>  i suppose so </s>
<s>  i dont know </s>
<s> 

but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door </s>
<s>  when
he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker
looked up </s>
<s>  he showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it his lips and his nails were of the same pale leadcolour and then
the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe </s>
<s>  the
look and the action had occupied but an instant </s>
<s> 

you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

here is a visitor </s>
<s> 

the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his
work </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said defarge </s>
<s>  here is monsieur who knows a wellmade shoe when
he sees one </s>
<s>  show him that shoe you are working at </s>
<s>  take it monsieur </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry took it in his hand </s>
<s> 

tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name </s>
<s> 

there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied </s>
<s> 

i forget what it was you asked me </s>
<s>  what did you say </s>
<s> 

i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieurs
information </s>
<s> 

it is a ladys shoe </s>
<s>  it is a young ladys walkingshoe </s>
<s>  it is in the
present mode </s>
<s>  i never saw the mode </s>
<s>  i have had a pattern in my hand </s>
<s>  he
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride </s>
<s> 

and the makers name </s>
<s>  said defarge </s>
<s> 

now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and
so on in regular changes without a moments intermission </s>
<s>  the task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or
endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a
fastdying man </s>
<s> 

did you ask me for my name </s>
<s> 

assuredly i did </s>
<s> 

one hundred and five north tower </s>
<s> 

is that all </s>
<s> 

one hundred and five north tower </s>
<s> 

with a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work
again until the silence was again broken </s>
<s> 

you are not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry looking steadfastly
at him </s>
<s> 

his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him </s>
<s>  but as no help came from that quarter they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground </s>
<s> 

i am not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  no i was not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  ii
learnt it here </s>
<s>  i taught myself </s>
<s>  i asked leave to

he lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time </s>
<s>  his eyes came slowly back at last to the face
from which they had wandered </s>
<s>  when they rested on it he started and
resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a
subject of last night </s>
<s> 

i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficulty after
a long while and i have made shoes ever since </s>
<s> 

as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him <abvr>
lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face </s>
<s> 

monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me </s>
<s> 

the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner </s>
<s> 

monsieur manette </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry laid his hand upon defarges arm </s>
<s>  do you
remember nothing of this man </s>
<s>  look at him </s>
<s>  look at me </s>
<s>  is there no old
banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your
mind monsieur manette </s>
<s> 

as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at <abvr>
lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him </s>
<s>  they were overclouded
again they were fainter they were gone </s>
<s>  but they had been there </s>
<s>  and
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where
she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him but which were now extending towards him
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression
repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her </s>
<s> 

darkness had fallen on him in its place </s>
<s>  he looked at the two less and
less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way </s>
<s>  finally with a deep long sigh he
took the shoe up and resumed his work </s>
<s> 

have you recognised him monsieur </s>
<s>  asked defarge in a whisper </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a moment </s>
<s>  at first i thought it quite hopeless but i have
unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew so
well </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s>  let us draw further back </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 

she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on
which he sat </s>
<s>  there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour </s>
<s> 

not a word was spoken not a sound was made </s>
<s>  she stood like a spirit
beside him and he bent over his work </s>
<s> 

it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand for his shoemakers knife </s>
<s>  it lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood </s>
<s>  he had taken it up and was
stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress </s>
<s>  he
raised them and saw her face </s>
<s>  the two spectators started forward
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand </s>
<s>  she had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife though they had </s>
<s> 

he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began
to form some words though no sound proceeded from them </s>
<s>  by degrees in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s> 

with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her
lips and kissed them to him </s>
<s>  then clasped them on her breast as if she
laid his ruined head there </s>
<s> 

you are not the gaolers daughter </s>
<s> 

she sighed no </s>
<s> 

who are you </s>
<s> 

not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench
beside him </s>
<s>  he recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm </s>
<s>  a strange
thrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame </s>
<s>  he
laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her </s>
<s> 

her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed
aside and fell down over her neck </s>
<s>  advancing his hand by little and
little he took it up and looked at it </s>
<s>  in the midst of the action
he went astray and with another deep sigh fell to work at his
shoemaking </s>
<s> 

but not for long </s>
<s>  releasing his arm she laid her hand upon his
shoulder </s>
<s>  after looking doubtfully at it two or three times as if to
be sure that it was really there he laid down his work put his hand
to his neck and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it </s>
<s>  he opened this carefully on his knee and it contained
a very little quantity of hair </s>
<s>  not more than one or two long golden
hairs which he had in some old day wound off upon his finger </s>
<s> 

he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at it </s>
<s>  it is
the same </s>
<s>  how can it be </s>
<s>  when was it </s>
<s>  how was it </s>
<s> 

as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too </s>
<s>  he turned her full to the
light and looked at her </s>
<s> 

she had laid her head upon my shoulder that night when i was summoned
outshe had a fear of my going though i had noneand when i was
brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve </s>
<s>  �you will
leave me them </s>
<s>  they can never help me to escape in the body though they
may in the spirit </s>
<s>  those were the words i said </s>
<s>  i remember them very
well </s>
<s> 

he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it </s>
<s> 
but when he did find spoken words for it they came to him coherently
though slowly </s>
<s> 

how was this </s>
<s> was it you </s>
<s> 

once more the two spectators started as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness </s>
<s>  but she sat perfectly still in his grasp and only
said in a low voice i entreat you good gentlemen do not come near
us do not speak do not move </s>
<s> 

hark </s>
<s>  he exclaimed </s>
<s>  whose voice was that </s>
<s> 

his hands released her as he uttered this cry and went up to his white
hair which they tore in a frenzy </s>
<s>  it died out as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast </s>
<s>  but he still looked at her and
gloomily shook his head </s>
<s> 

no no no </s>
<s>  you are too young too blooming </s>
<s>  it cant be </s>
<s>  see what the
prisoner is </s>
<s>  these are not the hands she knew this is not the face

<s>  she wasand he

<s>  what is your
name my gentle angel </s>

hailing his softened tone and manner his daughter fell upon her knees
before him with her appealing hands upon his breast </s>
<s> 

o sir at another time you shall know my name and who my mother was
and who my father and how i never knew their hard hard history </s>

cannot tell you at this time and i cannot tell you here </s>
<s>  all that i may

<s>  kiss me kiss me </s>
<s>  o my dear my dear </s>

his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him </s>
<s>

child </s>
<s>

he had sunk in her arms and his face dropped on her breast </s>
<s>  a sight so
touching yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it that the two beholders covered their faces </s>
<s> 

when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
stormsemblem to humanity of the rest and silence into which the storm
called life must hush at lastthey came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground </s>
<s>  he had gradually dropped to the floor and lay
there in a lethargy worn out </s>

head might lie upon her arm </s>
<s>  and her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light </s>
<s> 

if without disturbing him she said raising her hand to <abvr> lorry as
he stooped over them after repeated blowings of his nose all could be
arranged for our leaving paris at once so that from the very door he
could be taken away

but consider </s>
<s>  is he fit for the journey </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

more fit for that i think than to remain in this city so dreadful to

<s>  more
than that </s>
<s>  monsieur manette is for all reasons best out of france </s>

say shall i hire a carriage and posthorses </s>

thats business said <abvr> lorry resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners </s>

then be so kind urged miss manette as to leave us here </s>
<s>  you see how

now </s>

<s>  if you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption i do not doubt that you will find him when you come back
as quiet as you leave him </s>
<s>  in any case i will take care of him until
you return and then we will remove him straight </s>
<s> 

both <abvr> lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course and
in favour of one of them remaining </s>
<s>  but as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to but travelling papers </s>
<s>  and as time pressed
for the day was drawing to an end it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done and hurrying away
to do it </s>
<s> 

then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him </s>
<s>  the darkness
deepened and deepened and they both lay quiet until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall </s>

meat wine and hot coffee </s>

lamp he carried on the shoemakers bench there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed and he and <abvr> lorry roused the captive and

no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind in
the scared blank wonder of his face </s>
<s>  whether he knew what had happened
whether he recollected what they had said to him whether he knew that
he was free were questions which no sagacity could have solved </s>
<s>  they
tried speaking to him </s>
<s>  but he was so confused and so very slow to
answer that they took fright at his bewilderment and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more </s>
<s>  he had a wild lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands that had not been seen
in him before </s>
<s>  yet he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughters voice and invariably turned to it when she spoke </s>

in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink and put on the cloak

round at the walls </s>

but before she could repeat the question he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it </s>

remember </s>
<s>  no i dont remember </s>
<s>  it was so very long ago </s>
<s> 

that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house was apparent to them </s>

one hundred and five north tower </s>

him </s>

tread as being in expectation of a drawbridge </s>

heavy shadow of temple bar </s>

diningtable in it and never had a dinner and where even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty the first letters written to you

from the horror of being ogled through the windows by the heads

deference than he made an outward show of you are a lean old one

and went his way </s>
<s> 

they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outside newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it </s>
<s> 
but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised and where dire diseases were bred that came
into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulled him off the bench </s>
<s>  it
had more than once happened that the judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him </s>
<s> 
for the rest the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly innyard
from which pale travellers set out continually in carts and coaches on
a violent passage into the other world </s>
<s>  traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road and shaming few good citizens if any </s>
<s> 
so powerful is use and so desirable to be good use in the beginning </s>
<s>  it
was famous too for the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent </s>
<s>  also for
the whippingpost another dear old institution very humanising and
softening to behold in action </s>
<s>  also for extensive transactions in
bloodmoney another fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under heaven </s>
<s>  altogether the old bailey at that date was a choice
illustration of the precept that whatever is is right </s>
<s>  an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy did it not include the troublesome
consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong </s>
<s> 

making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought and handed in
his letter through a trap in it </s>
<s>  for people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play in bedlamonly the
former entertainment was much the dearer </s>
<s>  therefore all the old bailey
doors were well guardedexcept indeed the social doors by which the
criminals got there and those were always left wide open </s>

gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundle of papers
before him </s>

court </s>

with his hand jerry attracted the notice of <abvr> lorry who had stood up
to look for him and who quietly nodded and sat down again </s>

<s> 

the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court stopped the dialogue </s>

central point of interest </s>
<s>  two gaolers who had been standing there
went out and the prisoner was brought in and put to the bar </s>

everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling stared at him </s>

pillars and corners to get a sight of him </s>

themselves at anybodys cost to a view of himstood atiptoe got

conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of newgate jerry stood </s>
<s>  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer and gin and tea and coffee and what not

<s> 

the object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of about
fiveandtwenty wellgrown and welllooking with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye </s>
<s>  his condition was that of a young gentleman </s>
<s>  he was plainly
dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which was long and
dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck </s>
<s>  more to be out
of his way than for ornament </s>
<s>  as an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun </s>
<s>  he was otherwise quite selfpossessed
bowed to the judge and stood quiet </s>
<s> 

the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at
was not a sort that elevated humanity </s>
<s>  had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his
fascination </s>

iii </s>
<s>  a disappointment


mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral had to inform the jury that the prisoner before
them though young in years was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life </s>
<s>  that this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of today or of yesterday or
even of last year or of the year before </s>
<s>  that it was certain the
prisoner had for longer than that been in the habit of passing and
repassing between france and england on secret business of which
he could give no honest account </s>
<s>  that if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered </s>
<s> 
that providence however had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach to ferret out the nature of the
prisoners schemes and struck with horror to disclose them to his
majestys chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council </s>
<s> 
that this patriot would be produced before them </s>
<s>  that his position and
attitude were on the whole sublime </s>
<s>  that he had been the prisoners
friend but at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom on the sacred altar of his country </s>
<s>  that if statues
were decreed in britain as in ancient greece and rome to public
benefactors this shining citizen would assuredly have had one </s>
<s>  that as
they were not so decreed he probably would not have one </s>
<s>  that virtue
as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have word for word at the tips of their tongues </s>
<s> 
whereat the jurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages was in a manner contagious </s>
<s>  more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love of country </s>
<s> 
that the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the crown to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour had
communicated itself to the prisoners servant and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his masters tabledrawers and pockets
and secrete his papers </s>
<s>  that he <abvr> attorneygeneral was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant </s>
<s>  but that
in a general way he preferred him to his <abvr> attorneygenerals
brothers and sisters and honoured him more than his <abvr>
attorneygenerals father and mother </s>
<s>  that he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise </s>
<s>  that the evidence of these two
witnesses coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his majestys forces and of their disposition and preparation both by
sea and land and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power </s>
<s>  that these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoners handwriting </s>
<s>  but that it was all the
same </s>
<s>  that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions </s>
<s>  that the proof
would go back five years and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the british troops and the americans </s>
<s> 
that for these reasons the jury being a loyal jury as he knew they
were and being a responsible jury as they knew they were must
positively find the prisoner guilty and make an end of him whether
they liked it or not </s>
<s>  that they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows </s>
<s>  that they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows </s>
<s>  that they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows </s>
<s>  in short that
there never more could be for them or theirs any laying of heads upon
pillows at all unless the prisoners head was taken off </s>
<s>  that head
mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral concluded by demanding of them in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone </s>
<s> 

when the attorneygeneral ceased a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner in
anticipation of what he was soon to become </s>

the virtuous servant roger cly swore his way through the case at a
great rate </s>

simplicity four years ago </s>

packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner had engaged him </s>

charitynever thought of such a thing </s>

the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soon afterwards </s>

his clothes while travelling he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoners pockets over and over again </s>
<s>  he had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoners desk </s>
<s>  he had not put them there first </s>
<s>  he
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen
at calais and similar lists to french gentlemen both at calais and
boulogne </s>

information </s>

far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd </s>

standing as it were apart with her on the edge of his grave not all
the staring curiosity that looked on could for the moment nerve him
to remain quite still </s>
<s>  his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden </s>
<s>  and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart </s>

yes sir </s>

occasion </s>

you are the young lady just now referred to </s>

o </s>
<s>  most unhappily i am </s>
<s> 

the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the judge as he said something fiercely </s>
<s>  answer the questions put
to you and make no remark upon them </s>
<s> 

miss manette had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the channel </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>

recall it </s>
<s> 

in the midst of a profound stillness she faintly began </s>
<s>  when the
gentleman came on board

do you mean the prisoner </s>
<s>  inquired the judge knitting his brows </s>
<s> 

yes my lord </s>
<s> 

then say the prisoner </s>
<s> 

when the prisoner came on board he noticed that my father turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health </s>
<s>  my father was so reduced that i was
afraid to take him out of the air and i had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps and i sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him </s>
<s>  there were no other passengers that night but we four </s>
<s> 
the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could
shelter my father from the wind and weather better than i had done </s>
<s>  i
had not known how to do it well not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour </s>
<s>  he did it for me </s>
<s>  he expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my fathers state and i am sure he
felt it </s>
<s>  that was the manner of our beginning to speak together </s>
<s> 

let me interrupt you for a moment </s>
<s>  had he come on board alone </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

how many were with him </s>
<s> 

two french gentlemen </s>
<s> 

had they conferred together </s>
<s> 

they had conferred together until the last moment when it was
necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat </s>
<s> 

had any papers been handed about among them similar to these lists </s>
<s> 

some papers had been handed about among them but i dont know what
papers </s>
<s> 

like these in shape and size </s>
<s> 

possibly but indeed i dont know although they stood whispering very
near to me </s>
<s>  because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there </s>
<s>  it was a dull lamp and they
spoke very low and i did not hear what they said and saw only that
they looked at papers </s>
<s> 

now to the prisoners conversation miss manette </s>
<s> 

the prisoner was as open in his confidence with mewhich arose out
of my helpless situationas he was kind and good and useful to my
father </s>
<s>  i hope bursting into tears i may not repay him by doing him
harm today </s>
<s> 

buzzing from the blueflies </s>
<s> 

miss manette if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to givewhich you must
giveand which you cannot escape from givingwith great unwillingness
he is the only person present in that condition </s>
<s>  please to go on </s>
<s> 

he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name </s>
<s>  he said that this business
had within a few days taken him to france and might at intervals
take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long
time to come </s>
<s> 

did he say anything about america miss manette </s>
<s>  be particular </s>
<s> 

he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen and he said
that so far as he could judge it was a wrong and foolish one on
englands part </s>
<s>  he added in a jesting way that perhaps george
washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the
third </s>
<s>  but there was no harm in his way of saying this </s>
<s>  it was said
laughingly and to beguile the time </s>
<s> 

any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators </s>
<s>  her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence and in the pauses when
she stopped for the judge to write it down watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against </s>
<s>  among the lookerson there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court </s>
<s>  insomuch that a great majority
of the foreheads there might have been mirrors reflecting the witness
when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about george washington </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral now signified to my lord that he deemed it
necessary as a matter of precaution and form to call the young ladys
father doctor manette </s>
<s>  who was called accordingly </s>
<s> 

doctor manette look upon the prisoner </s>
<s>  have you ever seen him before </s>
<s> 

once </s>
<s>  when he called at my lodgings in london </s>
<s>  some three years or
three years and a half ago </s>
<s> 

can you identify him as your fellowpassenger on board the packet or
speak to his conversation with your daughter </s>
<s> 

sir i can do neither </s>
<s> 

is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either </s>
<s> 

he answered in a low voice there is </s>
<s> 

has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment without
trial or even accusation in your native country doctor manette </s>
<s> 

he answered in a tone that went to every heart a long imprisonment </s>
<s> 

were you newly released on the occasion in question </s>
<s> 

they tell me so </s>
<s> 

have you no remembrance of the occasion </s>
<s> 

none </s>
<s>  my mind is a blank from some timei cannot even say what
timewhen i employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to the
time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter
here </s>
<s>  she had become familiar to me when a gracious god restored
my faculties </s>
<s>  but i am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar </s>
<s>  i have no remembrance of the process </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral sat down and the father and daughter sat down
together </s>
<s> 

a singular circumstance then arose in the case </s>
<s>  the object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down with some fellowplotter untracked
in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago and
got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did
not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more
to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information </s>
<s>  a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required
in the coffeeroom of an hotel in that garrisonanddockyard town
waiting for another person </s>
<s>  the prisoners counsel was crossexamining
this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him </s>
<s>  opening
this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner </s>
<s> 

you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner </s>
<s> 

the witness was quite sure </s>
<s> 

did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner </s>
<s> 

not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken </s>
<s> 

look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the
prisoner </s>
<s>  how say you </s>
<s>  are they very like each other </s>
<s> 

allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise
not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought
into comparison </s>
<s>  my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became
much more remarkable </s>
<s>  my lord inquired of <abvr> stryver the prisoners
counsel whether they were next to try <abvr> carton name of my learned
friend for treason </s>
<s>  but <abvr> stryver replied to my lord no </s>
<s>  but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might
happen twice </s>
<s>  whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so
confident having seen it </s>
<s>  and more </s>
<s>  the upshot of which was to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence </s>
<s>  he had now to attend while <abvr>
stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit
of clothes </s>
<s>  showing them how the patriot barsad was a hired spy and
traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judaswhich he certainly did look
rather like </s>
<s>  how the virtuous servant cly was his friend and partner
and was worthy to be </s>
<s>  how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family
affairs in france he being of french extraction did require his making
those passages across the channelthough what those affairs were a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him
even for his life to disclose </s>
<s>  how the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together </s>
<s> with the exception of that
reference to george washington which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke </s>
<s> 
how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears and therefore <abvr> attorneygeneral had made the most of it </s>
<s> 
how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the
state trials of this country were full </s>
<s>  but there my lord interposed
with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  stryver then called his few witnesses and <abvr> cruncher had next to
attend while <abvr> attorneygeneral turned the whole suit of clothes <abvr>
stryver had fitted on the jury inside out </s>
<s>  showing how barsad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the
prisoner a hundred times worse </s>
<s>  lastly came my lord himself turning
the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner </s>
<s> 

and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court
changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement </s>
<s> 
while his learned friend <abvr> stryver massing his papers before him
whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury </s>
<s>  while all the spectators moved more or less and
grouped themselves anew </s>
<s>  while even my lord himself arose from his seat
and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish </s>
<s>  this one man
sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his
hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day </s>
<s>  something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him
a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness
when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the
lookerson taking note of him now said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike </s>
<s>  <abvr> cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour and added id hold half a guinea
that he dont get no lawwork to do </s>
<s>  dont look like the sort of one
to get any do he </s>
<s> 

yet this <abvr> carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in </s>

<s>  look to that young lady </s>
<s>  help the gentleman to take her out </s>
<s> 
dont you see she will fall </s>
<s> 

there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much
sympathy with her father </s>
<s>  it had evidently been a great distress to
him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled </s>
<s>  he had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud
ever since </s>
<s>  as he passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a
moment spoke through their foreman </s>
<s> 

they were not agreed and wished to retire </s>
<s>  my lord perhaps with george
washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward
and retired himself </s>
<s>  the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted </s>
<s>  it began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while </s>
<s>  the spectators dropped off to get
refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat
down </s>
<s> 

mr </s>

drawing his arm through his own he took him down ludgatehill to

shown into a little room where charles darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine </s>

do you feel yet that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again <abvr>
darnay </s>

i am frightfully confused regarding time and place </s>

it must be an immense satisfaction </s>

flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall where it shivered to

again darnay answered not a word </s>

she was mightily pleased to have your message when i gave it her </s>

that she showed she was pleased but i suppose she was </s>

the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this
disagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him in the
strait of the day </s>
<s>  he turned the dialogue to that point and thanked him
for it </s>

i neither want any thanks nor merit any was the careless rejoinder </s>

it was nothing to do in the first place </s>

it in the second </s>

you have acted as if you do </s>

the bill being paid charles darnay rose and wished him good night </s>

without returning the wish carton rose too with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner and said a last word <abvr> darnay </s>

however </s>

<s>  good night </s>
<s> 

when he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went to a
glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely in it </s>
<s> 

do you particularly like the man </s>

<s>  why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you </s>
<s>  there is nothing
in you to like </s>

v </s>
<s>  the jackal


those were drinking days and most men drank hard </s>
<s>  so very great is
the improvement time has brought about in such habits that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman would seem in these days a ridiculous exaggeration </s>
<s> 
the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities </s>
<s>  neither was <abvr>
stryver already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice behind his compeers in this particular any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race </s>
<s> 

a favourite at the old bailey and eke at the sessions <abvr> stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted </s>
<s>  sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite
specially to their longing arms </s>
<s>  and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the lord chief justice in the court of kings bench the
florid countenance of <abvr> stryver might be daily seen bursting out of
the bed of wigs like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions </s>
<s> 

it had once been noted at the bar that while <abvr> stryver was a glib
man and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments </s>
<s> 
but a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this </s>
<s>  the more
business he got the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow </s>
<s>  and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney
carton he always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning </s>
<s> 

sydney carton idlest and most unpromising of men was stryvers great
ally </s>
<s>  what the two drank together between hilary term and michaelmas
might have floated a kings ship </s>
<s>  stryver never had a case in hand
anywhere but carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring
at the ceiling of the court </s>
<s>  they went the same circuit and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings like a dissipated cat </s>
<s>  at last it began to get about
among such as were interested in the matter that although sydney carton
would never be a lion he was an amazingly good jackal and that he
rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity </s>

after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes
he got up tossed his hat on and walked out </s>
<s>  he turned into the temple
and having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of kings
benchwalk and paperbuildings turned into the stryver chambers </s>
<s> 

the stryver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gone
home and the stryver principal opened the door </s>
<s>  he had his slippers on
and a loose bedgown and his throat was bare for his greater ease </s>
<s>  he
had that rather wild strained seared marking about the eyes which
may be observed in all free livers of his class from the portrait of
jeffries downward and which can be traced under various disguises of
art through the portraits of every drinking age </s>
<s> 

you are a little late memory said stryver </s>
<s> 

about the usual time </s>
<s>  it may be a quarter of an hour later </s>
<s> 

they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers
where there was a blazing fire </s>
<s>  a kettle steamed upon the hob and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone with plenty of wine upon
it and brandy and rum and sugar and lemons </s>
<s> 

you have had your bottle i perceive sydney </s>

i thought he was rather a handsome fellow and i thought i should have
been much the same sort of fellow if i had had any luck </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch </s>
<s> 

you and your luck sydney </s>
<s>  get to work get to work </s>
<s> 

sullenly enough the jackal loosened his dress went into an adjoining
room and came back with a large jug of cold water a basin and a towel
or two </s>
<s>  steeping the towels in the water and partially wringing them
out he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold sat down
at the table and said now i am ready </s>

the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinkingtable while the jackal sat at his own paperbestrewn table
proper on the other side of it with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand </s>
<s>  both resorted to the drinkingtable without stint but each in
a different way </s>
<s>  the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband looking at the fire or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document </s>
<s>  the jackal with knitted brows and intent face
so deep in his task that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glasswhich often groped about for a minute or
more before it found the glass for his lips </s>
<s>  two or three times the
matter in hand became so knotty that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up and steep his towels anew </s>
<s>  from these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe </s>
<s>  which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity </s>
<s> 

at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion and
proceeded to offer it to him </s>
<s>  the lion took it with care and caution
made his selections from it and his remarks upon it and the jackal
assisted both </s>
<s>  when the repast was fully discussed the lion put his
hands in his waistband again and lay down to meditate </s>
<s>  the jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle and a fresh application
to his head and applied himself to the collection of a second meal </s>
<s> 
this was administered to the lion in the same manner and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning </s>
<s> 

and now we have done sydney fill a bumper of punch said <abvr>
stryver </s>

the jackal removed the towels from his head which had been steaming
again shook himself yawned shivered and complied </s>

a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not to be

rustled its green leaves churchorgans claimed to be made and silver

workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered
about there or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard or a
thump from the golden giant </s>

its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him </s>

ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and

and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have forgiven
him to take ladybirds affections away from me </s>

no </s>

manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured

pross i dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of

well </s>
<s>  to the best of my understanding and bads the best youll tell
me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid

afraid </s>

its plain enough i should think why he may be </s>

remembrance </s>

knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again </s>
<s>  that alone wouldnt make the
subject pleasant i should think </s>
<s> 

it was a profounder remark than <abvr> lorry had looked for </s>
<s>  true said
he and fearful to reflect upon </s>
<s>  yet a doubt lurks in my mind miss
pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him </s>
<s>  indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence </s>
<s> 

cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head </s>
<s>  touch that
string and he instantly changes for the worse </s>
<s>  better leave it alone </s>
<s> 
in short must leave it alone like or no like </s>
<s>  sometimes he gets up in
the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking
up and down walking up and down in his room </s>

his old prison </s>

a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him </s>
<s>  in silence they go walking up and down
together walking up and down together till her love and company have
brought him to himself </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding miss prosss denial of her own imagination there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea
in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to
her possessing such a thing </s>
<s> 

the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes </s>
<s>  it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going </s>
<s> 

here they are </s>
<s>  said miss pross rising to break up the conference </s>
<s> 
and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon </s>
<s> 

it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such a
peculiar ear of a place that as <abvr> lorry stood at the open window
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied
they would never approach </s>
<s>  not only would the echoes die away as though
the steps had gone </s>
<s>  but echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand </s>
<s>  however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them </s>
<s> 

miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking
off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and
folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women </s>
<s>  her darling was a pleasant
sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do
playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own
chamber and cried </s>
<s>  the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at
them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would
have had more if it were possible </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry was a pleasant sight too
beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home </s>
<s>  but no
hundreds of people came to see the sights and <abvr> lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of miss prosss prediction </s>
<s> 

dinnertime and still no hundreds of people </s>
<s>  in the arrangements of
the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and
always acquitted herself marvellously </s>
<s>  her dinners of a very modest
quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their
contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be
better </s>
<s>  miss prosss friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of
impoverished french who tempted by shillings and halfcrowns would
impart culinary mysteries to her </s>
<s>  from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress
or cinderellas godmother </s>
<s>  who would send out for a fowl a rabbit
a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she
pleased </s>
<s> 

on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower
regions or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance </s>
<s>  on this occasion
miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her unbent exceedingly </s>
<s>  so the dinner was very pleasant too </s>
<s> 

it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the planetree and they should sit
there in the air </s>
<s>  as everything turned upon her and revolved about her
they went out under the planetree and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of <abvr> lorry </s>

time before as <abvr> lorrys cupbearer </s>

planetree talking she kept his glass replenished </s>

whispered to them in its own way above their heads </s>

presented himself while they were sitting under the planetree but he
was only one </s>

retired into the house </s>

vivacity </s>

floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the
earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found

had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler </s>

he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his
lips when he put it down </s>
<s> 

what is that </s>
<s>  he calmly asked looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour </s>
<s> 

monseigneur </s>
<s>  that </s>
<s> 

outside the blinds </s>
<s>  open the blinds </s>
<s> 

it was done </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s> 

monseigneur it is nothing </s>
<s>  the trees and the night are all that are
here </s>
<s> 

the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked out into
the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind him looking round
for instructions </s>
<s> 

good said the imperturbable master </s>
<s>  close them again </s>
<s> 

that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper </s>
<s>  he was
half way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand
hearing the sound of wheels </s>
<s>  it came on briskly and came up to the
front of the chateau </s>
<s> 

ask who is arrived </s>
<s> 

it was the nephew of monseigneur </s>
<s>  he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur early in the afternoon </s>
<s>  he had diminished the distance
rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road </s>
<s> 
he had heard of monseigneur at the postinghouses as being before him </s>
<s> 

he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and
there and that he was prayed to come to it </s>
<s>  in a little while he came </s>
<s> 
he had been known in england as charles darnay </s>
<s> 

monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shake
hands </s>
<s> 

you left paris yesterday sir </s>
<s>  he said to monseigneur as he took his
seat at table </s>
<s> 

yesterday </s>
<s>  and you </s>
<s> 

i come direct </s>
<s> 

from london </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

you have been a long time coming said the marquis with a smile </s>
<s> 

on the contrary </s>
<s>  i come direct </s>
<s> 

pardon me </s>
<s>  i mean not a long time on the journey </s>
<s>  a long time
intending the journey </s>
<s> 

i have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his
answervarious business </s>
<s> 

without doubt said the polished uncle </s>
<s> 

so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them </s>
<s> 
when coffee had been served and they were alone together the nephew
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask opened a conversation </s>
<s> 

i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that
took me away </s>
<s>  it carried me into great and unexpected peril </s>
<s>  but it is
a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have
sustained me </s>
<s> 

not to death said the uncle </s>
<s>  it is not necessary to say to death </s>
<s> 

i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there </s>
<s> 

the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that </s>
<s>  the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring </s>
<s> 

indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me </s>
<s> 

no no no said the uncle pleasantly </s>
<s> 

but however that may be resumed the nephew glancing at him with
deep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means
and would know no scruple as to means </s>
<s> 

my friend i told you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation in the
two marks </s>
<s>  do me the favour to recall that i told you so long ago </s>
<s> 

i recall it </s>
<s> 

thank you said the marquisvery sweetly indeed </s>
<s> 

his tone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musical
instrument </s>
<s> 

in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to be at once your
bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in
france here </s>
<s> 

i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffee </s>
<s> 
dare i ask you to explain </s>
<s> 

i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely </s>
<s> 

it is possible said the uncle with great calmness </s>
<s>  for the honour
of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent </s>
<s> 
pray excuse me </s>
<s> 

i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before
yesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew </s>
<s> 

i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle with refined
politeness </s>
<s>  i would not be sure of that </s>
<s>  a good opportunity for
consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself </s>
<s>  but it is useless to discuss the question </s>
<s>  i am as you say
at a disadvantage </s>
<s>  these little instruments of correction these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that
might so incommode you are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity </s>
<s>  they are sought by so many and they are granted
comparatively to so few </s>
<s>  it used not to be so but france in all such
things is changed for the worse </s>
<s>  our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar </s>
<s>  from this room many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged </s>
<s>  in the next room my bedroom
one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter </s>
<s>  we have
lost many privileges </s>
<s>  a new philosophy has become the mode </s>
<s>  and the
assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as
to say would but might cause us real inconvenience </s>
<s>  all very bad very
bad </s>
<s> 

the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his head </s>
<s> 
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself that great means of regeneration </s>
<s> 

we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern
time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our name to be
more detested than any name in france </s>
<s> 

let us hope so said the uncle </s>
<s>  detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low </s>
<s> 

there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face i can
look at in all this country round about us which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery </s>
<s> 

a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the family
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur </s>
<s> 
hah </s>
<s>  and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff and lightly
crossed his legs </s>
<s> 

but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness closeness
and dislike than was comportable with its wearers assumption of
indifference </s>
<s> 

repression is the only lasting philosophy </s>
<s>  the dark deference of fear
and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to it shuts
out the sky </s>
<s> 

that might not be so long as the marquis supposed </s>
<s>  if a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence could have been shown to
him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly firecharred plunderwrecked rains </s>
<s>  as for the roof
he vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new
wayto wit for ever from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets </s>
<s> 

meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour and repose
of the family if you will not </s>
<s>  but you must be fatigued </s>
<s>  shall we
terminate our conference for the night </s>
<s> 

a moment more </s>
<s> 

an hour if you please </s>
<s> 

sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits
of wrong </s>
<s> 

we have done wrong </s>
<s>  repeated the marquis with an inquiring smile
and delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself </s>
<s> 

our family </s>
<s>  our honourable family whose honour is of so much account
to both of us in such different ways </s>
<s>  even in my fathers time we did
a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure whatever it was </s>
<s>  why need i speak of my fathers time
when it is equally yours </s>
<s>  can i separate my fathers twinbrother joint
inheritor and next successor from himself </s>
<s> 

death has done that </s>
<s>  said the marquis </s>
<s> 

and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that is
frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it </s>
<s>  seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the last
look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to
redress </s>
<s>  and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain </s>
<s> 

seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him on the
breast with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou
will for ever seek them in vain be assured </s>
<s> 

every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was
cruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew with his snuffbox in his hand </s>
<s>  once again he
touched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword with which in delicate finesse he ran him through the
body and said

my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have
lived </s>
<s> 

when he had said it he took a culminating pinch of snuff and put his
box in his pocket </s>
<s> 

better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing a small
bell on the table and accept your natural destiny </s>
<s>  but you are lost
monsieur charles i see </s>
<s> 

this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadly </s>
<s>  i
renounce them </s>
<s> 

are they both yours to renounce </s>
<s>  france may be but is the property </s>
<s>  it
is scarcely worth mentioning </s>
<s>  but is it yet </s>
<s> 

i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet </s>
<s>  if it passed
to me from you tomorrow

which i have the vanity to hope is not probable </s>
<s> 

or twenty years hence

you do me too much honour said the marquis </s>
<s>  still i prefer that
supposition </s>
<s> 

i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere </s>
<s>  it is little to
relinquish </s>
<s>  what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room </s>
<s> 

to the eye it is fair enough here </s>
<s>  but seen in its integrity
under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste
mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hunger nakedness
and suffering </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said the marquis again in a wellsatisfied manner </s>
<s> 

if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the
weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in
another generation suffer less </s>
<s>  but it is not for me </s>
<s>  there is a curse
on it and on all this land </s>
<s> 

and you </s>
<s>  said the uncle </s>
<s>  forgive my curiosity </s>
<s>  do you under your new
philosophy graciously intend to live </s>
<s> 

i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at
their backs may have to do some daywork </s>
<s> 

in england for example </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  the family honour sir is safe from me in this country </s>
<s>  the
family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other </s>
<s> 

the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to be
lighted </s>
<s>  it now shone brightly through the door of communication </s>
<s>  the
marquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of his
valet </s>
<s> 

england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there he observed then turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile </s>
<s> 

i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may
be indebted to you sir </s>
<s>  for the rest it is my refuge </s>
<s> 

they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of many </s>
<s>  you
know a compatriot who has found a refuge there </s>
<s>  a doctor </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

with a daughter </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

yes said the marquis </s>
<s>  you are fatigued </s>
<s>  good night </s>
<s> 

as he bent his head in his most courtly manner there was a secrecy
in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly </s>
<s>  at the same
time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes and the thin
straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic </s>
<s> 

yes repeated the marquis </s>
<s>  a doctor with a daughter </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  so
commences the new philosophy </s>
<s>  you are fatigued </s>
<s>  good night </s>
<s> 

it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his </s>
<s>  the nephew
looked at him in vain in passing on to the door </s>
<s> 

good night </s>
<s>  said the uncle </s>
<s>  i look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning </s>
<s>  good repose </s>
<s>  light monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there </s>
<s> and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will he
added to himself before he rang his little bell again and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom </s>
<s> 

the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamberrobe to prepare himself gently for sleep that hot still
night </s>
<s>  rustling about the room his softlyslippered feet making no
noise on the floor he moved like a refined tiger </s>
<s> looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort in story whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off or just
coming on </s>
<s> 

he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again at the
scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind </s>
<s>  the slow
toil up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent the mill the
prison on the crag the little village in the hollow the peasants at
the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage </s>
<s>  that fountain suggested the paris fountain
the little bundle lying on the step the women bending over it and the
tall man with his arms up crying dead </s>
<s> 

i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may go to bed </s>
<s> 

so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep </s>
<s> 

the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours </s>
<s>  for three heavy hours the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by menpoets </s>
<s>  but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them </s>
<s> 

for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion and human
stared blindly at the night </s>
<s>  dead darkness lay on all the landscape
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads </s>
<s> 
the burialplace had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another </s>
<s>  the figure on the cross might
have come down for anything that could be seen of it </s>
<s>  in the village
taxers and taxed were fast asleep </s>
<s>  dreaming perhaps of banquets as
the starved usually do and of ease and rest as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may its lean inhabitants slept soundly and were fed and
freed </s>
<s> 

the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheardboth melting away like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of timethrough three dark
hours </s>
<s>  then the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened </s>
<s> 

lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees and poured its radiance over the hill </s>
<s>  in the glow the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stone faces
crimsoned </s>
<s>  the carol of the birds was loud and high and on the
weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieur
the marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might </s>
<s> 
at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed and with open
mouth and dropped underjaw looked awestricken </s>
<s> 

now the sun was full up and movement began in the village </s>
<s>  casement
windows opened crazy doors were unbarred and people came forth
shiveringchilled as yet by the new sweet air </s>
<s>  then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population </s>
<s>  some to the
fountain </s>
<s>  some to the fields </s>
<s>  men and women here to dig and delve </s>
<s>  men
and women there to see to the poor live stock and lead the bony cows
out to such pasture as could be found by the roadside </s>
<s>  in the church
and at the cross a kneeling figure or two </s>
<s>  attendant on the latter
prayers the led cow trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot </s>
<s> 

the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awoke gradually and
surely </s>
<s>  first the lonely boarspears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old </s>
<s>  then had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine </s>
<s> 
now doors and windows were thrown open horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways leaves sparkled and rustled at irongrated windows dogs
pulled hard at their chains and reared impatient to be loosed </s>
<s> 

all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life and the
return of morning </s>
<s>  surely not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau nor the running up and down the stairs </s>
<s>  nor the hurried
figures on the terrace </s>
<s>  nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away </s>
<s> 

what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads already
at work on the hilltop beyond the village with his days dinner not
much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crows while to
peck at on a heap of stones </s>
<s>  had the birds carrying some grains of it
to a distance dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds </s>
<s>  whether or
no the mender of roads ran on the sultry morning as if for his life
down the hill kneehigh in dust and never stopped till he got to the
fountain </s>
<s> 

all the people of the village were at the fountain standing about
in their depressed manner and whispering low but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise </s>
<s>  the led cows hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them were looking stupidly
on or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter </s>
<s>  some of
the people of the chateau and some of those of the postinghouse and
all the taxing authorities were armed more or less and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way that was
highly fraught with nothing </s>
<s>  already the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap </s>
<s>  what did all this portend
and what portended the swift hoistingup of monsieur gabelle behind
a servant on horseback and the conveying away of the said gabelle
doubleladen though the horse was at a gallop like a new version of

<s> 

it portended that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau </s>
<s> 

the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night and had added
the one stone face wanting </s>
<s>  the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years </s>
<s> 

it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis </s>
<s>  it was like a fine
mask suddenly startled made angry and petrified </s>

young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a

<s>  such masters were not

circumstances of his country and those were of evergrowing interest </s>

in london he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold nor
to lie on beds of roses </s>
<s>  if he had had any such exalted expectation he
would not have prospered </s>

read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a

sydney had been working double tides that night and the night before
and the night before that and a good many nights in succession making
a grand clearance among <abvr> stryvers papers before the setting in
of the long vacation </s>

arrears were handsomely fetched up </s>

november should come with its fogs atmospheric and fogs legal and

sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application </s>

through the night </s>

the towelling </s>
<s>  and he was in a very damaged condition as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours </s>

his hands in his waistband glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back </s>

you are a luckier if you mean that </s>

i dont mean that </s>

<s> 

well </s>
<s>  ill say gallantry </s>
<s>  my meaning is that i am a man said stryver
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch who cares more to
be agreeable who takes more pains to be agreeable who knows better how
to be agreeable in a womans society than you do </s>

no </s>

way ill have this out with you </s>

moroseness there </s>

sydney </s>

it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar to

to me </s>

you shall not get off in that way rejoined stryver shouldering the
rejoinder at him </s>

myself agreeable than you have being more independent in circumstances </s>

why do i do it </s>

you dont get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions

he asked the question with some appearance of scorn </s>

you have no business to be incorrigible was his friends answer
delivered in no very soothing tone </s>

i have no business to be at all that i know of said sydney carton </s>
<s> 
who is the lady </s>
<s> 

now dont let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable
sydney said <abvr> stryver preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make because i know you dont mean
half you say </s>
<s>  and if you meant it all it would be of no importance </s>
<s>  i
make this little preface because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms </s>

i did </s>

certainly </s>

sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend </s>
<s> 
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend </s>

you made mention of the young lady as a goldenhaired doll </s>
<s>  the young
lady is miss manette </s>
<s>  if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way sydney i might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation </s>

<s> 
you want that sense altogether </s>
<s>  therefore i am no more annoyed when i
think of the expression than i should be annoyed by a mans opinion of
a picture of mine who had no eye for pictures </s>
<s>  or of a piece of music
of mine who had no ear for music </s>

sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate </s>

looking at his friend </s>

now you know all about it syd said <abvr> stryver </s>

fortune </s>

please myself </s>

you would and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would

ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will </s>

enough of this style of life with no other as a change from it </s>

feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it when he doesnt he can stay away and i feel
that miss manette will tell well in any station and will always do me
credit </s>

you really ought to think about a nurse </s>

the prosperous patronage with which he said it made him look twice as

westward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sun

the sun goes down </s>
<s> 

with his straw in his mouth <abvr> cruncher sat watching the two streams
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one streamsaving that jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry </s>

women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from
tellsons side of the tides to the opposite shore </s>
<s>  brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance <abvr> cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health </s>

the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose that he recruited his finances as just now observed </s>

it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few and belated women few and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that <abvr>
cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when an
unusual concourse pouring down fleetstreet westward attracted his
attention </s>

suggestion to have �em out and to pull �em out mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop </s>
<s>  on the crowds opening the coach
doors the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
for a moment </s>

shedding his cloak hat long hatband white pockethandkerchief and
other symbolical tears </s>

enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops </s>

crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded </s>
<s> 
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing </s>
<s>  practical suggestions being
much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it </s>
<s>  among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tellsons in the further corner of the mourning
coach </s>
<s> 

the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies </s>
<s>  but the river being alarmingly near and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief </s>
<s> 
the remodelled procession started with a chimneysweep driving the
hearseadvised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under
close inspection for the purposeand with a pieman also attended
by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach </s>
<s>  a bearleader a
popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional
ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand </s>
<s>  and his
bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked </s>
<s> 

thus with beerdrinking pipesmoking songroaring and infinite
caricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting
at every step and all the shops shutting up before it </s>

in course of time </s>
<s>  insisted on pouring into the burialground </s>
<s>  finally
accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way and
highly to its own satisfaction </s>
<s> 

the dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter
genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passersby as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them </s>
<s>  chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated </s>
<s>  the transition to the sport of
windowbreaking and thence to the plundering of publichouses was easy
and natural </s>
<s>  at last after several hours when sundry summerhouses had
been pulled down and some arearailings had been torn up to arm
the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the guards were
coming </s>

most vigilant watch on <abvr> cruncher and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions

<s>  with this view he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her rather than

forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other
fishing tackle of that nature </s>

in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on <abvr> cruncher
extinguished the light and went out </s>

young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed was not long after his father </s>
<s>  under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the
court followed out into the streets </s>
<s>  he was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the
door stood ajar all night </s>
<s> 

impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to house fronts
walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his
honoured parent in view </s>
<s>  the honoured parent steering northward had not
gone far when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton and
the two trudged on together </s>
<s> 

within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the
winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a
lonely road </s>
<s>  another fisherman was picked up hereand that so silently
that if young jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split
himself into two </s>
<s> 

the three went on and young jerry went on until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road </s>
<s>  upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall surmounted by an iron railing </s>
<s>  in the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which
the wallthere risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one side </s>
<s> 
crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that
young jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an iron gate </s>
<s> 
he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the
third </s>
<s>  they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay
there a littlelistening perhaps </s>
<s>  then they moved away on their hands
and knees </s>
<s> 

it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate </s>
<s>  which he did
holding his breath </s>
<s>  crouching down again in a corner there and looking
in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass </s>
<s> 
and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large churchyard
that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant </s>
<s>  they did not
creep far before they stopped and stood upright </s>
<s>  and then they began to
fish </s>
<s> 

they fished with a spade at first </s>
<s>  presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew </s>
<s> 
whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off
with his hair as stiff as his fathers </s>
<s> 

but his longcherished desire to know more about these matters not
only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again </s>
<s>  they
were still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time </s>
<s>  but now they seemed to have got a bite </s>
<s>  there was a
screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were
strained as if by a weight </s>
<s>  by slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it and came to the surface </s>
<s>  young jerry very well knew what
it would be </s>
<s>  but when he saw it and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open he was so frightened being new to the sight that he
made off again and never stopped until he had run a mile or more </s>
<s> 

he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran and one highly desirable
to get to the end of </s>
<s>  he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him </s>
<s>  and pictured as hopping on behind him bolt
upright upon its narrow end always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to
shun </s>
<s>  it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too for while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boys kite without tail and wings </s>
<s>  it hid in doorways
too rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them up
to its ears as if it were laughing </s>
<s>  it got into shadows on the road
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up </s>
<s>  all this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead </s>
<s>  and even then
it would not leave him but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair scrambled into bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on
his breast when he fell asleep </s>
<s> 

from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father in the
family room </s>
<s>  something had gone wrong with him </s>
<s>  at least so young jerry
inferred from the circumstance of his holding <abvr> cruncher by the
ears and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of the
bed </s>
<s>

<s> 

jerry jerry jerry </s>

<s> 

i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested with tears </s>
<s> 

is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business </s>
<s>  is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business </s>
<s>  is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business </s>
<s> 

you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry </s>
<s> 

its enough for you retorted <abvr> cruncher to be the wife of a
honest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculations

wife would let his trade alone altogether </s>

<s>  if youre a religious woman give me a irreligious one </s>
<s>  you have
no more natral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has

<s> 

the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminated in
the honest tradesmans kicking off his claysoiled boots and lying down
at his length on the floor </s>
<s>  after taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay
down too and fell asleep again </s>
<s> 

there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else </s>
<s>  <abvr>
cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an iron potlid
by him as a projectile for the correction of <abvr> cruncher in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace </s>
<s>  he was brushed
and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling </s>
<s> 

young jerry walking with the stool under his arm at his fathers side
along sunny and crowded fleetstreet was a very different young jerry
from him of the previous night running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer </s>
<s>  his cunning was fresh with the day
and his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in fleetstreet and the city of london
that fine morning </s>
<s> 

father said young jerry as they walked along </s>
<s>  taking care to keep
at arms length and to have the stool well between them </s>

hat to give his spikes free play hes a tradesman </s>

his goods said <abvr> cruncher after turning it over in his mind is a
branch of scientific goods </s>

i believe it is something of that sort said <abvr> cruncher </s>

mr </s>

<s>  be careful to dewelop
your talents and never to say no more than you can help to nobody and
theres no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit

to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar <abvr> cruncher added to
himself </s>

<s> 

this had been the third morning in succession on which there had been
early drinking at the wineshop of monsieur defarge </s>
<s>  it had begun
on monday and here was wednesday come </s>
<s>  there had been more of early
brooding than drinking </s>

were to the full as interested in the place however as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine </s>

an answering chorus of good day </s>

their eyes and sat silent </s>

elbows bound fast at his hips with cords that were knotted behind him </s>

i stand aside messieurs by my heap of stones to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road that where any
spectacle is well worth looking at and at first as they approach i
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound and
that they are almost black to my sightexcept on the side of the sun
going to bed where they have a red edge messieurs </s>

road and are on the hill above it and are like the shadows of giants </s>

to me i recognise the tall man and he recognises me </s>
<s>  ah but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hillside once again as

laugh and pick him up again </s>

snap of his teeth </s>

voice withdraws </s>

nothing more was said and the mender of roads being found already
dozing on the topmost stair was advised to lay himself down on the

asleep </s>

worse quarters than defarges wineshop could easily have been found

the man moved a little further away as soon as he could and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap </s>

and oppressive </s>
<s>  if he needed a king and queen to restore him he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand </s>
<s>  for soon the largefaced king

ladies and fine lords </s>

<s>  until he absolutely wept
with sentiment </s>
<s>  during the whole of this scene which lasted some three

was done two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose which
everybody recognised and which nobody had seen of old </s>

crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified a

little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains

manner and observing that it was time to go to bed </s>

next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wineshop knitting away assiduously </s>

now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction of her

and heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame fell
dead at the bottom </s>

themselves were elephants or something as far removed until they met

thought as much at court that sunny summer day </s>

felt to be a new one </s>

rose in her headdress before she looked at the figure </s>

customers ceased talking and began gradually to drop out of the
wineshop </s>

stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered
madame </s>

for her father and they sat alone under the planetree </s>
<s> 

you are happy my dear father </s>
<s> 

quite my child </s>
<s> 

they had said little though they had been there a long time </s>
<s>  when it
was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work nor had she read to him </s>
<s>  she had employed herself in
both ways at his side under the tree many and many a time </s>
<s>  but this
time was not quite like any other and nothing could make it so </s>
<s> 

and i am very happy tonight dear father </s>
<s>  i am deeply happy in the
love that heaven has so blessedmy love for charles and charless love
for me </s>
<s>  but if my life were not to be still consecrated to you or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us even by
the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappy and
selfreproachful now than i can tell you </s>
<s>  even as it is

even as it was she could not command her voice </s>
<s> 

in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face
upon his breast </s>
<s>  in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of
the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and
its going </s>
<s> 

dearest dear </s>
<s>  can you tell me this last time that you feel quite
quite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine will
ever interpose between us </s>
<s>  i know it well but do you know it </s>
<s>  in your
own heart do you feel quite certain </s>
<s> 

her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed quite sure my darling </s>
<s>  more than that he
added as he tenderly kissed her </s>
<s>  my future is far brighter lucie
seen through your marriage than it could have beennay than it ever
waswithout it </s>
<s> 

if i could hope that my father </s>
<s> 

believe it love </s>
<s>  indeed it is so </s>
<s>  consider how natural and how plain
it is my dear that it should be so </s>
<s>  you devoted and young cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be
wasted

she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his and repeated
the word </s>
<s> 

wasted my childshould not be wasted struck aside from the
natural order of thingsfor my sake </s>
<s>  your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this </s>
<s>  but only ask yourself
how could my happiness be perfect while yours was incomplete </s>
<s> 

if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quite happy
with you </s>
<s> 

he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without charles having seen him </s>
<s>  and replied </s>
<s> 

my child you did see him and it is charles </s>
<s>  if it had not been
charles it would have been another </s>
<s>  or if it had been no other i
should have been the cause and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you </s>
<s> 

it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering </s>
<s>  it gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears </s>
<s>  and she remembered it long
afterwards </s>
<s> 

see </s>
<s>  said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards the moon </s>
<s> 
i have looked at her from my prisonwindow when i could not bear her
light </s>
<s>  i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beaten my head against
my prisonwalls </s>
<s>  i have looked at her in a state so dull and lethargic
that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i
could draw across her at the full and the number of perpendicular lines
with which i could intersect them </s>
<s>  he added in his inward and pondering
manner as he looked at the moon it was twenty either way i remember
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in </s>
<s> 

the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time
deepened as he dwelt upon it </s>
<s>  but there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference </s>
<s>  he only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over </s>
<s> 

i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom i had been rent </s>
<s>  whether it was alive </s>
<s>  whether it had
been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it </s>
<s>  whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father </s>
<s>  there was a time in my
imprisonment when my desire for vengeance was unbearable </s>
<s>  whether it
was a son who would never know his fathers story </s>
<s>  who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own
will and act </s>
<s>  whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman </s>
<s> 

she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand </s>
<s> 

i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful of
merather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me </s>
<s>  i have
cast up the years of her age year after year </s>
<s>  i have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate </s>
<s>  i have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living and in the next generation my place was a
blank </s>
<s> 

my father </s>
<s>  even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child </s>
<s> 

you lucie </s>
<s>  it is out of the consolation and restoration you have
brought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and
the moon on this last night </s>
<s> what did i say just now </s>
<s> 

she knew nothing of you </s>
<s>  she cared nothing for you </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations couldi have imagined her as coming to me in my cell and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress </s>
<s>  i have seen her
image in the moonlight often as i now see you </s>
<s>  except that i never held
her in my arms </s>
<s>  it stood between the little grated window and the door </s>
<s> 
but you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of </s>
<s> 

the figure was not </s>
<s>  thetheimage </s>
<s>  the fancy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  that was another thing </s>
<s>  it stood before my disturbed sense of
sight but it never moved </s>
<s>  the phantom that my mind pursued was another
and more real child </s>
<s>  of her outward appearance i know no more than
that she was like her mother </s>
<s>  the other had that likeness tooas you
havebut was not the same </s>
<s>  can you follow me lucie </s>
<s>  hardly i think </s>
<s> 
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions </s>
<s> 

his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition </s>
<s> 

in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlight
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father </s>
<s>  my picture
was in her room and i was in her prayers </s>
<s>  her life was active
cheerful useful </s>
<s>  but my poor history pervaded it all </s>
<s> 

i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my love
that was i </s>
<s> 

and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvais and
they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me </s>
<s>  when they passed
a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning walls and looked
up at its bars and spoke in whispers </s>
<s>  she could never deliver me </s>
<s>  i
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things </s>
<s> 
but then blessed with the relief of tears i fell upon my knees and
blessed her </s>
<s> 

i am that child i hope my father </s>
<s>  o my dear my dear will you bless
me as fervently tomorrow </s>
<s> 

lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have tonight
for loving you better than words can tell and thanking god for my great
happiness </s>
<s>  my thoughts when they were wildest never rose near the
happiness that i have known with you and that we have before us </s>
<s> 

he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him </s>
<s>  byandbye they went into the
house </s>
<s> 

there was no one bidden to the marriage but <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross </s>
<s>  the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence </s>
<s>  they had been able to extend it
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothing more </s>
<s> 

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper </s>
<s>  they were only
three at table and miss pross made the third </s>
<s>  he regretted that charles
was not there </s>
<s>  was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away </s>
<s>  and drank to him affectionately </s>
<s> 

so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and they separated </s>
<s> 
but in the stillness of the third hour of the morning lucie came
downstairs again and stole into his room </s>
<s>  not free from unshaped fears
beforehand </s>
<s> 

all things however were in their places </s>
<s>  all was quiet </s>
<s>  and he lay
asleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet </s>
<s>  she put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips to his </s>
<s> 
then leaned over him and looked at him </s>
<s> 

into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had worn </s>
<s>  but he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep </s>
<s>  a more remarkable face in its quiet
resolute and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep that night </s>
<s> 

she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be and as his
sorrows deserved </s>
<s>  then she withdrew her hand and kissed his lips once
more and went away </s>
<s>  so the sunrise came and the shadows of the leaves
of the planetree moved upon his face as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him </s>
<s> 




xviii </s>
<s>  nine days


the marriageday was shining brightly and they were ready outside the
closed door of the doctors room where he was speaking with charles
darnay </s>
<s>  they were ready to go to church </s>
<s>  the beautiful bride <abvr>
lorry and miss prossto whom the event through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable would have been one of absolute bliss
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should
have been the bridegroom </s>
<s> 

and so said <abvr> lorry who could not sufficiently admire the bride
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet
pretty dress </s>
<s>  and so it was for this my sweet lucie that i brought
you across the channel such a baby </s>
<s>  lord bless me </s>
<s>  how little i thought
what i was doing </s>
<s>  how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring
on my friend <abvr> charles </s>

you didnt mean it remarked the matteroffact miss pross and
therefore how could you know it </s>

really </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  but dont cry said the gentle <abvr> lorry </s>

i am not crying said miss pross </s>
<s>  you are </s>

i my pross </s>
<s>  by this time <abvr> lorry dared to be pleasant with her
on occasion </s>

you were just now </s>

<s>  such
a present of plate as you have made �em is enough to bring tears into
anybodys eyes </s>
<s>  theres not a fork or a spoon in the collection said
miss pross that i didnt cry over last night after the box came till
i couldnt see it </s>
<s> 

i am highly gratified said <abvr> lorry though upon my honour i
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one </s>
<s>  dear me </s>
<s>  this is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost </s>
<s>  dear dear dear </s>
<s>  to think that there
might have been a <abvr> lorry any time these fifty years almost </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>  from miss pross </s>
<s> 

you think there never might have been a <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  asked the
gentleman of that name </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  rejoined miss pross </s>
<s>  you were a bachelor in your cradle </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  observed <abvr> lorry beamingly adjusting his little wig that
seems probable too </s>
<s> 

and you were cut out for a bachelor pursued miss pross before you
were put in your cradle </s>
<s> 

then i think said <abvr> lorry that i was very unhandsomely dealt
with and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern </s>
<s>  enough </s>
<s>  now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist i hear them moving in the next room and miss pross and
i as two formal folks of business are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear </s>
<s>  you leave
your good father my dear in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own </s>
<s>  he shall be taken every conceivable care of </s>
<s>  during the next
fortnight while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts even tellsons
shall go to the wall comparatively speaking before him </s>
<s>  and when at
the fortnights end he comes to join you and your beloved husband on
your other fortnights trip in wales you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame </s>
<s>  now i hear
somebodys step coming to the door </s>
<s>  let me kiss my dear girl with an
oldfashioned bachelor blessing before somebody comes to claim his
own </s>
<s> 

for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at the
wellremembered expression on the forehead and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which if such things be oldfashioned were as old as adam </s>
<s> 

the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles
darnay </s>
<s>  he was so deadly palewhich had not been the case when they
went in togetherthat no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face </s>
<s> 
but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered except that to the
shrewd glance of <abvr> lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him like a cold
wind </s>
<s> 

he gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to the chariot
which <abvr> lorry had hired in honour of the day </s>
<s>  the rest followed in
another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange
eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married </s>
<s> 

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling
glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of <abvr> lorrys pockets </s>
<s>  they returned home to
breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the
door at parting </s>
<s> 

it was a hard parting though it was not for long </s>
<s>  but her father
cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms take her charles </s>
<s>  she is yours </s>
<s> 

and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was
gone </s>
<s> 

the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the
preparations having been very simple and few the doctor <abvr> lorry
and miss pross were left quite alone </s>
<s>  it was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall that <abvr> lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor </s>
<s>  as if the golden arm uplifted
there had struck him a poisoned blow </s>
<s> 

he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone </s>
<s>  but it was
the old scared lost look that troubled <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got upstairs <abvr> lorry was reminded of defarge the
wineshop keeper and the starlight ride </s>
<s> 

i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i
think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him </s>
<s> 
i must look in at tellsons </s>
<s>  so i will go there at once and come back
presently </s>
<s>  then we will take him a ride into the country and dine
there and all will be well </s>
<s> 

it was easier for <abvr> lorry to look in at tellsons than to look out of
tellsons </s>
<s>  he was detained two hours </s>
<s>  when he came back he ascended the
old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant </s>
<s>  going thus
into the doctors rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  he said with a start </s>
<s>  whats that </s>
<s> 

miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear </s>
<s>  o me o me </s>
<s>  all is
lost </s>
<s>  cried she wringing her hands </s>
<s>  what is to be told to ladybird </s>
<s> 
he doesnt know me and is making shoes </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the
doctors room </s>
<s>  the bench was turned towards the light as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent
down and he was very busy </s>
<s> 

doctor manette </s>
<s>  my dear friend doctor manette </s>
<s> 

the doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly half as if he
were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again </s>
<s> 

he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat </s>
<s>  his shirt was open at the
throat as it used to be when he did that work </s>
<s>  and even the old
haggard faded surface of face had come back to him </s>
<s>  he worked
hardimpatientlyas if in some sense of having been interrupted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape </s>
<s>  he took up another that was lying by
him and asked what it was </s>
<s> 

a young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking up </s>
<s>  it
ought to have been finished long ago </s>
<s>  let it be </s>
<s> 

but doctor manette </s>
<s>  look at me </s>
<s> 

he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in
his work </s>
<s> 

you know me my dear friend </s>
<s>  think again </s>
<s>  this is not your proper
occupation </s>
<s>  think dear friend </s>
<s> 

nothing would induce him to speak more </s>
<s>  he looked up for an instant at
a time when he was requested to do so </s>
<s>  but no persuasion would extract
a word from him </s>
<s>  he worked and worked and worked in silence and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on
the air </s>
<s>  the only ray of hope that <abvr> lorry could discover was that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked </s>
<s>  in that there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind </s>
<s> 

two things at once impressed themselves on <abvr> lorry as important above
all others </s>
<s>  the first that this must be kept secret from lucie </s>
<s> 
the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him </s>
<s>  in
conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a
few days of complete rest </s>
<s>  in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been
called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post </s>
<s> 

these measures advisable to be taken in any case <abvr> lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself </s>
<s>  if that should happen soon he kept
another course in reserve </s>
<s>  which was to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best on the doctors case </s>
<s> 

in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable <abvr> lorry resolved to watch him
attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so </s>
<s>  he
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for the
first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same
room </s>
<s> 

he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him since on being pressed he became worried </s>
<s>  he abandoned that
attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen or was falling </s>
<s>  he remained therefore in his seat near the
window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place </s>
<s> 

doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on
that first day until it was too dark to seeworked on half an hour
after <abvr> lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write </s>
<s> 
when he put his tools aside as useless until morning <abvr> lorry rose
and said to him </s>
<s> 

will you go out </s>
<s> 

he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner
looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice </s>
<s> 

out </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a walk with me </s>
<s>  why not </s>
<s> 

he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in
some misty way asking himself why not </s>
<s>  the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it </s>
<s> 

miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room </s>
<s>  he paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down </s>
<s>  but when he did finally lay himself down he
fell asleep </s>
<s>  in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his
bench and to work </s>
<s> 

on this second day <abvr> lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them </s>
<s>  he
returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and
that he thought about it however confusedly </s>
<s>  this encouraged <abvr> lorry
to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day </s>
<s> 
at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then
present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing
amiss </s>
<s>  this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long
enough or often enough to harass him </s>
<s>  and it lightened <abvr> lorrys
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him </s>
<s> 

when it fell dark again <abvr> lorry asked him as before </s>
<s> 

dear doctor will you go out </s>
<s> 

as before he repeated out </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a walk with me </s>
<s>  why not </s>
<s> 

this time <abvr> lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned </s>
<s>  in the
meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had
sat there looking down at the planetree </s>
<s>  but on <abvr> lorrys return he
slipped away to his bench </s>
<s> 

the time went very slowly on and <abvr> lorrys hope darkened and his
heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day </s>
<s> 
the third day came and went the fourth the fifth </s>
<s>  five days six days
seven days eight days nine days </s>
<s> 

with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier <abvr> lorry passed through this anxious time </s>
<s>  the secret was
well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy </s>
<s>  but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first
was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on
his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in
the dusk of the ninth evening </s>
<s> 




xix </s>
<s>  an opinion


worn out by anxious watching <abvr> lorry fell asleep at his post </s>
<s>  on the
tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night </s>
<s> 

he rubbed his eyes and roused himself </s>
<s>  but he doubted when he had
done so whether he was not still asleep </s>
<s>  for going to the door of the
doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench
and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading
at the window </s>
<s>  he was in his usual morning dress and his face which
mr </s>
<s>  lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly
studious and attentive </s>
<s> 

even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake <abvr> lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own </s>
<s>  for did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed
as usual </s>
<s>  and was there any sign within their range that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened </s>
<s> 

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the
answer being obvious </s>
<s>  if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there </s>
<s> 
how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor
manettes consultingroom and to be debating these points outside the
doctors bedroom door in the early morning </s>
<s> 

within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side </s>
<s>  if he
had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have
resolved it </s>
<s>  but he was by that time clearheaded and had none </s>
<s> 
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfasthour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred </s>
<s>  if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind <abvr>
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain </s>
<s> 

miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked
out with care </s>
<s>  having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette <abvr> lorry presented himself at the breakfasthour in his usual
white linen and with his usual neat leg </s>
<s>  the doctor was summoned in the
usual way and came to breakfast </s>
<s> 

so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which <abvr> lorry felt to be the only safe
advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken
place yesterday </s>
<s>  an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to
the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and
counting and evidently made him uneasy </s>
<s>  in all other respects however
he was so composedly himself that <abvr> lorry determined to have the aid
he sought </s>
<s>  and that aid was his own </s>
<s> 

therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the
doctor were left together <abvr> lorry said feelingly </s>
<s> 

my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested </s>
<s>  that is to say it is
very curious to me </s>
<s>  perhaps to your better information it may be less
so </s>
<s> 

glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the
doctor looked troubled and listened attentively </s>
<s>  he had already glanced
at his hands more than once </s>
<s> 

doctor manette said <abvr> lorry touching him affectionately on the
arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine </s>
<s>  pray
give your mind to it and advise me well for his sakeand above all
for his daughtershis daughters my dear manette </s>
<s> 

if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental
shock </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

be explicit said the doctor </s>
<s>  spare no detail </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded </s>
<s> 

my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock
of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings
thetheas you express itthe mind </s>
<s>  the mind </s>
<s>  it is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how
long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there
are no other means of getting at it </s>

which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace
himselfas i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner </s>

the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to
be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and
great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge which was already very large </s>
<s>  but unfortunately
there has been he paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse </s>
<s> 

the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration </s>
<s> 

nine days and nights </s>
<s> 

how did it show itself </s>
<s>  i infer glancing at his hands again in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock </s>
<s> 

that is the fact </s>
<s> 

now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and
collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit
originally </s>
<s> 

once </s>
<s> 

and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respectsor in all
respectsas he was then </s>
<s> 

i think in all respects </s>
<s> 

you spoke of his daughter </s>
<s>  does his daughter know of the relapse </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her </s>
<s> 
it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted </s>
<s> 

the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind </s>
<s>  that was
very thoughtful </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of
the two spoke for a little while </s>
<s> 

now my dear manette said <abvr> lorry at length in his most
considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters </s>
<s>  i do not
possess the kind of information necessary </s>
<s>  i do not possess the kind of
intelligence </s>
<s>  i want guiding </s>
<s>  there is no man in this world on whom
i could so rely for right guidance as on you </s>
<s>  tell me how does this
relapse come about </s>
<s>  is there danger of another </s>
<s>  could a repetition of it
be prevented </s>
<s>  how should a repetition of it be treated </s>
<s>  how does it come
about at all </s>
<s>  what can i do for my friend </s>
<s>  no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine
if i knew how </s>
<s> 

but i dont know how to originate in such a case </s>
<s>  if your sagacity
knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be
able to do so much </s>
<s>  unenlightened and undirected i can do so little </s>
<s> 
pray discuss it with me </s>
<s>  pray enable me to see it a little more clearly
and teach me how to be a little more useful </s>
<s> 

doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and
mr </s>
<s>  lorry did not press him </s>
<s> 

i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort
that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite
unforeseen by its subject </s>
<s> 

was it dreaded by him </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry ventured to ask </s>
<s> 

very much </s>
<s>  he said it with an involuntary shudder </s>
<s> 

you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers
mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him </s>
<s> 

would he asked <abvr> lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on
him </s>
<s> 

i think so </s>
<s>  but it is as i have told you next to impossible </s>
<s>  i even
believe itin some casesto be quite impossible </s>
<s> 

now said <abvr> lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors arm again
after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this
attack </s>
<s> 

i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady </s>
<s>  some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled i think </s>
<s>  it is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations
would be recalledsay under certain circumstancessay on a
particular occasion </s>
<s>  he tried to prepare himself in vain </s>
<s>  perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it </s>
<s> 

would he remember what took place in the relapse </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> lorry
with natural hesitation </s>
<s> 

the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and
answered in a low voice not at all </s>
<s> 

now as to the future hinted <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have
great hope </s>
<s>  as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i
should have great hope </s>
<s>  he yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that
the worst was over </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  thats good comfort </s>
<s>  i am thankful </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

i am thankful </s>
<s>  repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence </s>
<s> 

there are two other points said <abvr> lorry on which i am anxious to
be instructed </s>
<s>  i may go on </s>
<s> 

you cannot do your friend a better service </s>
<s>  the doctor gave him his
hand </s>
<s> 

to the first then </s>
<s>  he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic </s>
<s> 
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things </s>
<s>  now does
he do too much </s>
<s> 

i think not </s>
<s>  it may be the character of his mind to be always in
singular need of occupation </s>
<s>  that may be in part natural to it </s>
<s>  in
part the result of affliction </s>
<s>  the less it was occupied with healthy
things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction </s>
<s>  he may have observed himself and made the discovery </s>
<s> 

you are sure that he is not under too great a strain </s>
<s> 

i think i am quite sure of it </s>
<s> 

my dear manette if he were overworked now

my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be </s>
<s>  there has been a
violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight </s>
<s> 

excuse me as a persistent man of business </s>
<s>  assuming for a moment
that he was overworked </s>
<s>  it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder </s>
<s> 

i do not think so </s>
<s>  i do not think said doctor manette with the
firmness of selfconviction that anything but the one train of
association would renew it </s>
<s>  i think that henceforth nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it </s>
<s>  after what has
happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again </s>
<s>  i trust and i almost
believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted </s>
<s> 

he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress </s>
<s>  it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence </s>
<s>  he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was and approached his second and last point </s>
<s>  he felt it to
be the most difficult of all </s>
<s>  but remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days he knew that he must face it </s>
<s> 

the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from said <abvr> lorry clearing his throat we
will callblacksmiths work blacksmiths work </s>
<s>  we will say to put a
case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad
time to work at a little forge </s>
<s>  we will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again </s>
<s>  is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him </s>
<s> 

the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot
nervously on the ground </s>
<s> 

he has always kept it by him said <abvr> lorry with an anxious look at
his friend </s>
<s>  now would it not be better that he should let it go </s>
<s> 

still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the
ground </s>
<s> 

you do not find it easy to advise me </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  i quite
understand it to be a nice question </s>
<s>  and yet i think and there he
shook his head and stopped </s>
<s> 

you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause
it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings
of this poor mans mind </s>
<s>  he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation and it was so welcome when it came </s>
<s>  no doubt it relieved
his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more
practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental
torture </s>
<s>  that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach </s>
<s>  even now when i believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not
find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child </s>
<s> 

he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to <abvr> lorrys
face </s>
<s> 

but may notmind </s>
<s>  i ask for information as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and
banknotesmay not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea </s>
<s>  if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go
with it </s>
<s>  in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the
forge </s>
<s> 

there was another silence </s>
<s> 

you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old
companion </s>
<s> 

i would not keep it said <abvr> lorry shaking his head </s>
<s>  for he gained
in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted </s>
<s>  i would recommend him to
sacrifice it </s>
<s>  i only want your authority </s>
<s>  i am sure it does no good </s>
<s> 
come </s>
<s>  give me your authority like a dear good man </s>
<s>  for his daughters
sake my dear manette </s>
<s> 

very strange to see what a struggle there was within him </s>
<s> 

in her name then let it be done </s>
<s>  i sanction it </s>
<s>  but i would not take
it away while he was present </s>
<s>  let it be removed when he is not there </s>
<s> 
let him miss his old companion after an absence </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended </s>
<s>  they
passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored </s>
<s>  on the
three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband </s>
<s>  the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence <abvr> lorry had previously
explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and
she had no suspicions </s>
<s> 

on the night of the day on which he left the house <abvr> lorry went into
his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross
carrying a light </s>
<s>  there with closed doors and in a mysterious and
guilty manner <abvr> lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor
which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure </s>
<s>  the
burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire </s>
<s>  and the tools
shoes and leather were buried in the garden </s>
<s>  so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds that <abvr> lorry and miss pross
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible
crime </s>

about him which was new to the observation of charles darnay </s>

he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of
speaking to him when no one overheard </s>

they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away </s>

afterwards he was to all outward appearance as unsubstantial as ever </s>

when he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross the doctor and <abvr> lorry charles darnay made some mention of

problem of carelessness and recklessness </s>

bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself </s>

he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife </s>

her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked </s>

we are thoughtful tonight </s>

yes dearest charles with her hands on his breast and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him </s>

cheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him </s>

a wonderful corner for echoes it has been remarked that corner where
the doctor lived </s>
<s>  ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband and her father and herself and her old directress and
companion in a life of quiet bliss lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner listening to the echoing footsteps of
years </s>
<s> 

at first there were times though she was a perfectly happy young wife
when her work would slowly fall from her hands and her eyes would be
dimmed </s>
<s>  for there was something coming in the echoes something light
afar off and scarcely audible yet that stirred her heart too much </s>
<s> 
fluttering hopes and doubtshopes of a love as yet unknown to her </s>
<s> 
doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy that new delightdivided
her breast </s>
<s>  among the echoes then there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave </s>
<s>  and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate and who would mourn for her so much swelled to her
eyes and broke like waves </s>
<s> 

that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom </s>
<s>  then among the
advancing echoes there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words </s>
<s>  let greater echoes resound as they would the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming </s>
<s>  they came and
the shady house was sunny with a childs laugh and the divine friend of
children to whom in her trouble she had confided hers seemed to take
her child in his arms as he took the child of old and made it a sacred
joy to her </s>
<s> 

ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives and making it predominate nowhere lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds </s>
<s>  her husbands
step was strong and prosperous among them </s>
<s>  her fathers firm and equal </s>
<s> 
lo miss pross in harness of string awakening the echoes as an
unruly charger whipcorrected snorting and pawing the earth under the
planetree in the garden </s>
<s> 

even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest they were not
harsh nor cruel </s>
<s>  even when golden hair like her own lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy and he said with a radiant
smile dear papa and mamma i am very sorry to leave you both and to

thus the rustling of an angels wings got blended with the other
echoes and they were not wholly of earth but had in them that breath
of heaven </s>
<s>  sighs of the winds that blew over a little gardentomb were
mingled with them also and both were audible to lucie in a hushed
murmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shoreas

dressing a doll at her mothers footstool chattered in the tongues of
the two cities that were blended in her life </s>

halfdozen times a year at most he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited and would sit among them through the evening as he had once
done often </s>
<s>  he never came there heated with wine </s>
<s>  and one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages </s>
<s> 

no man ever really loved a woman lost her and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind when she was a wife and a mother
but her children had a strange sympathy with himan instinctive
delicacy of pity for him </s>
<s>  what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in

life of it </s>

stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace made
it the life he was to lead </s>

state of lions jackal than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion </s>
<s>  stryver was rich </s>
<s>  had married a florid widow with
property and three boys who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads </s>
<s> 

these three young gentlemen <abvr> stryver exuding patronage of the most

off to some suitably retired spot and there hanged out of the way </s>
<s> 

these were among the echoes to which lucie sometimes pensive sometimes
amused and laughing listened in the echoing corner until her little
daughter was six years old </s>
<s>  how near to her heart the echoes of her
childs tread came and those of her own dear fathers always active
and selfpossessed and those of her dear husbands need not be told </s>

with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste was music to her </s>
<s>  nor how there were echoes all about her sweet
in her ears of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married if that could be than single and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him and asked her what is
the magic secret my darling of your being everything to all of us
as if there were only one of us yet never seeming to be hurried or to
have too much to do </s>

as the roadmender plied his dusty labour and the hailclouds rolling

heap of stones </s>

footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding </s>

when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed

together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of

chief functionary of the place became uneasy </s>

the night deepened </s>

flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a

the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the

branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard </s>

visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous </s>

then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front
picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches
and windows were </s>
<s>  then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter </s>
<s> 
soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the
stone faces awakened stared out of fire </s>
<s> 

a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away </s>

spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur
gabelles door </s>

impatiently but other help if that were any there was none </s>

mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood
with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky </s>

the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away
through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on

as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the
village was illuminating </s>

fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in

monsieur gabelle </s>

bellringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment

daysbecame impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his
house summoned him to come forth for personal conference </s>

monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel
with himself </s>
<s>  the result of that conference was that gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys </s>
<s>  this time
resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man
of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet and crush a man or two below </s>

probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the
distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door
combined with the joyringing for music </s>

illomened lamp slung across the road before his postinghouse gate

gabelle had resolved </s>

only crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him so
reproachfully in the face that as he walked to and fro in the temple

<s> 

he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold

do it and that it had never been done </s>

annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events of the week
following made all new again </s>
<s>  he knew very well that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded </s>
<s> not without disquiet but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance </s>
<s>  that he had watched
the times for a time of action and that they had shifted and struggled

france that might impeach him for it </s>

him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it was drawing him

him on faster and faster more and more steadily to the terrible
attraction </s>
<s>  his latent uneasiness had been that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they was not there
trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity </s>
<s>  with this uneasiness half stifled and half reproaching
him he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong </s>

injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur

coarse and galling for old reasons </s>

it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect that would be

it </s>
<s>  then that glorious vision of doing good which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
revolution that was running so fearfully wild </s>

neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone </s>

lucie should be spared the pain of separation </s>

reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old

situation was referable to her father through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind he did not
discuss with himself </s>

in his course </s>
<s> 

he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to
return to tellsons and take leave of <abvr> lorry </s>

 charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled as the carriage
rolled away </s>
<s> 

that nightit was the fourteenth of augusthe sat up late and wrote
two fervent letters </s>
<s>  one was to lucie explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to paris and showing her at length the reasons
that he had for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there </s>

their dear child to his care and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances </s>

in proof of his safety immediately after his arrival </s>

it was a hard day that day of being among them with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind </s>

preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious </s>

resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it

the day passed quickly </s>

of clothes ready and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets with a heavier heart </s>

a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished when charles

at paris </s>
<s>  whatever might befall now he must on to his journeys end </s>
<s> 
not a mean village closed upon him not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and england </s>
<s>  the universal
watchfulness so encompassed him that if he had been taken in a net
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone </s>
<s> 

this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in a day by
riding after him and taking him back riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation riding with him and keeping him in charge </s>
<s>  he had been
days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in
a little town on the high road still a long way from paris </s>
<s> 

nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelles letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far </s>
<s>  his difficulty at the
guardhouse in this small place had been such that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis </s>
<s>  and he was therefore as little surprised as
a man could be to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning in the middle of the night </s>
<s> 

awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on the bed </s>

<s>  as if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lampiron </s>

it is always as the good patriot says observed the functionary </s>
<s>  rise

<s> 

darnay complied and was taken back to the guardhouse where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleeping by
a watchfire </s>
<s>  here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he
started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning </s>
<s> 

the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured
cockades armed with national muskets and sabres who rode one on either
side of him </s>
<s> 

the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attached to
his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist </s>

faces </s>

and out upon the miredeep roads </s>
<s>  in this state they traversed without
change except of horses and pace all the miredeep leagues that lay
between them and the capital </s>
<s> 

they travelled in the night halting an hour or two after daybreak and
lying by until the twilight fell </s>
<s>  the escort were so wretchedly clothed
that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off </s>
<s>  apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying
his musket very recklessly charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast </s>
<s>  for
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations
confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made </s>
<s> 

but when they came to the town of beauvaiswhich they did at eventide
when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming </s>
<s>  an ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard and many voices called
out loudly down with the emigrant </s>

he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle and
resuming it as his safest place said </s>

checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to the
yard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on with

at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd which
another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates </s>
<s>  the farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned </s>

postmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yard </s>

they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep </s>
<s>  among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep </s>
<s>  after long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and
would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty or all drawn
up together singing a liberty song </s>
<s>  happily however there was sleep in
beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness </s>
<s>  jingling through the untimely cold and
wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their
way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads </s>
<s> 

daylight at last found them before the wall of paris </s>
<s>  the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it </s>
<s> 

where are the papers of this prisoner </s>
<s>  demanded a resolutelooking man
in authority who was summoned out by the guard </s>
<s> 

naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him and which he had paid for </s>
<s> 

where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him
whatever are the papers of this prisoner </s>
<s> 

the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them </s>
<s>  casting his
eyes over gabelles letter the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise and looked at darnay with a close attention </s>
<s> 

he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went
into the guardroom </s>
<s>  meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the
gate </s>
<s>  looking about him while in this state of suspense charles
darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots the latter far outnumbering the former </s>
<s>  and that while ingress
into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar
traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the homeliest
people was very difficult </s>
<s>  a numerous medley of men and women not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue
forth </s>
<s>  but the previous identification was so strict that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly </s>
<s>  some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered
about </s>
<s>  the red cap and tricolour cockade were universal both among men
and women </s>
<s> 

when he had sat in his saddle some halfhour taking note of these
things darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority
who directed the guard to open the barrier </s>
<s>  then he delivered to the
escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him
to dismount </s>
<s>  he did so and the two patriots leading his tired horse
turned and rode away without entering the city </s>
<s> 

he accompanied his conductor into a guardroom smelling of common wine
and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake
drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying about </s>
<s>  the
light in the guardhouse half derived from the waning oillamps of
the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition </s>

officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these </s>

them </s>

guardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter of

and set silence </s>

charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride
was touched besides </s>

how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets </s>

<s>  a few passers turned
their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat </s>

otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going to prison was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work </s>
<s>  in one narrow dark and dirty street through which they
passed an excited orator mounted on a stool was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people of the king and the royal
family </s>
<s>  the few words that he caught from this mans lips first made
it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris </s>
<s>  on the road except at
beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing </s>

watchfulness had completely isolated him </s>

that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left england he of course knew now </s>

perils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster and faster
yet he of course knew now </s>
<s>  he could not but admit to himself that he

the light of this later time they would appear </s>
<s>  troubled as the future

hope </s>
<s>  the horrible massacre days and nights long which within a few
rounds of the clock was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away </s>
<s>  the sharp female newlyborn and
called la guillotine was hardly known to him or to the generality

<s>  the frightful deeds that were to be soon done were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers </s>
<s>  how could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind </s>
<s> 

of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruel separation

certainty </s>
<s>  but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly </s>
<s>  with this on
his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he
arrived at the prison of la force </s>

a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom defarge
presented the emigrant evremonde </s>

the gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the question merely
replied one must have patience my dear </s>
<s>  three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added for
the love of liberty </s>

conclusion </s>

the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it </s>

flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that

from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came
the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring

key </s>

but such awful workers and such awful work </s>
<s> 

the grindstone had a double handle and turning at it madly were two
men whose faces as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise </s>

false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty and all awry with
howling and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep </s>

forward over their eyes now flung backward over their necks some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink </s>

blood and what with dropping wine and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire </s>
<s>  the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from

<s>  shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpeningstone were men stripped to the waist with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies </s>

<s>  some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them with strips of linen and fragments
of dress </s>
<s>  ligatures various in kind but all deep of the one colour </s>
<s>  and
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes </s>
<s> eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life to petrify with a welldirected gun </s>
<s> 

all this was seen in a moment as the vision of a drowning man or of

and was in the courtyard when <abvr> lorry regained the blind </s>

his streaming white hair his remarkable face and the impetuous
confidence of his manner as he put the weapons aside like water

the unintelligible sound of his voice </s>

assisted by the people and gone in search of her husband </s>
<s>  he found
her child and miss pross with her </s>
<s>  but it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew </s>

clinging to his hand </s>

bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge </s>

twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded and the

sharpened there said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  the place is national property now

twice more in all </s>

soon afterwards the day began to dawn and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand and cautiously looked out again </s>
<s>  a man so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone and looking about him with a vacant air </s>
<s> 
shortly this wornout murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of monseigneur and staggering to that gorgeous vehicle
climbed in at the door and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions </s>
<s> 

the great grindstone earth had turned when <abvr> lorry looked out again
and the sun was red on the courtyard </s>

alone there in the calm morning air with a red upon it that the sun had
never given and would never take away </s>

imperil tellsons by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under

for lucie and her child without a moments demur </s>

he held was not his own and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business </s>

at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of finding out
the wineshop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwellingplace in the distracted state of the city </s>
<s>  but the
same consideration that suggested him repudiated him </s>
<s>  he lived in the
most violent quarter and doubtless was influential there and deep in
its dangerous workings </s>

noon coming and the doctor not returning and every minutes delay
tending to compromise tellsons <abvr> lorry advised with lucie </s>

that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term in that
quarter near the bankinghouse </s>

giving them what comfort he could and much more than he had himself </s>

he left jerry with them as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head and returned to his own occupations </s>

a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him </s>

it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closed </s>
<s>  he
was again alone in his room of the previous night considering what to
do next when he heard a foot upon the stair </s>

man stood in his presence who with a keenly observant look at him

doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence </s>
<s>  so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her that
not until long afterwards when france and she were far apart did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace </s>
<s>  that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror </s>

tainted by the slain </s>
<s>  she only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of la force </s>
<s>  that in the prison he had
found a selfappointed tribunal sitting before which the prisoners were
brought singly and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred or to be released or in a few cases to be sent back
to their cells </s>
<s>  that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille </s>
<s>  that one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this
man was defarge </s>
<s> 

that hereupon he had ascertained through the registers on the table
that his soninlaw was among the living prisoners and had pleaded hard
to the tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake some
dirty with murder and some clean some sober and some notfor his life
and liberty </s>
<s>  that in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court and
examined </s>
<s>  that he seemed on the point of being at once released when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible
to the doctor which led to a few words of secret conference </s>
<s>  that
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody but should for his sake be held
inviolate in safe custody </s>
<s>  that immediately on a signal the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again </s>
<s>  but that he the
doctor had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his soninlaw was through no malice or mischance
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings that he had obtained the permission and
had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over </s>
<s> 

the sights he had seen there with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals shall remain untold </s>
<s>  the mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces </s>
<s>  one prisoner there was he said who had
been discharged into the street free but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out </s>
<s>  being besought to go to him and dress
the wound the doctor had passed out at the same gate and had found him
in the arms of a company of samaritans who were seated on the bodies
of their victims </s>
<s>  with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare they had helped the healer and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands and swooned away in the midst of it </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> lorry received these confidences and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixtytwo years of age a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger </s>
<s> 

but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect </s>
<s>  he had never
at all known him in his present character </s>
<s>  for the first time the doctor
felt now that his suffering was strength and power </s>
<s>  for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughters husband and deliver him </s>

it all tended to a good end my friend </s>

<s>  and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes the resolute face the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped like a
clock for so many years and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed </s>
<s> 

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with would
have yielded before his persevering purpose </s>
<s>  while he kept himself
in his place as a physician whose business was with all degrees
of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good he used his
personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons and among them of la force </s>
<s>  he could now assure lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners </s>
<s>  he saw her husband weekly and brought sweet
messages to her straight from his lips </s>
<s>  sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her though never by the doctors hand but she was
not permitted to write to him </s>
<s>  for among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad </s>

this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubt </s>

sagacious <abvr> lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it </s>
<s> 
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride </s>
<s>  it was a natural and worthy one </s>
<s> 
but he observed it as a curiosity </s>
<s>  the doctor knew that up to that
time his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness </s>
<s> 
now that this was changed and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charless
ultimate safety and deliverance he became so far exalted by the change
that he took the lead and direction and required them as the weak to
trust to him as the strong </s>
<s>  the preceding relative positions of himself
and lucie were reversed yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him </s>

curious to see thought <abvr> lorry in his amiably shrewd way but all
natural and right </s>

was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any

barsad said another voice striking in </s>
<s> 

thats the name for a thousand pound </s>
<s>  cried jerry </s>
<s> 

the speaker who struck in was sydney carton </s>
<s>  he had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his ridingcoat and he stood at <abvr> crunchers
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself </s>
<s> 

dont be alarmed my dear miss pross </s>

myself here to beg a little talk with your brother </s>

a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your
direction </s>
<s>  i walked into the wineshop here close after you and
sat near you </s>
<s>  i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the
nature of your calling </s>
<s>  and gradually what i had done at random seemed
to shape itself into a purpose <abvr> barsad </s>
<s> 

what purpose </s>
<s>  the spy asked </s>
<s> 

it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the
street </s>
<s>  could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your
companyat the office of tellsons bank for instance </s>
<s> 

under a threat </s>

oh </s>

really <abvr> barsad i cant say if you cant </s>

do you mean that you wont say sir </s>
<s>  the spy irresolutely asked </s>
<s> 

you apprehend me very clearly <abvr> barsad </s>
<s>  i wont </s>

cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret mind

<s>  his practised eye saw it and
made the most of it </s>
<s> 

now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his
sister </s>
<s>  if any trouble comes of this its your doing </s>
<s> 

come come <abvr> barsad </s>
<s>  exclaimed sydney </s>
<s>  dont be ungrateful </s>
<s> 
but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so

satisfaction </s>
<s>  do you go with me to the bank </s>

ill hear what you have got to say </s>

<s> 

miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life
remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and looked up
in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only
contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man </s>
<s>  she was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection and with sydneys friendly reassurances adequately to

as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that <abvr> lorry wanted

struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you

arrested for all that </s>

just now if at all </s>

mr </s>

mr </s>

of time to dwell upon the point </s>
<s>  confused but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was
silently attentive </s>
<s> 

now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrowyou said he
would be before the tribunal again tomorrow <abvr> barsad </s>

yes </s>

in as good stead tomorrow as today </s>

<s>  i own
to you i am shaken <abvr> lorry by doctor manettes not having had the

he may not have known of it beforehand said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how
identified he is with his soninlaw </s>
<s> 

thats true <abvr> lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand at his
chin and his troubled eyes on carton </s>
<s> 

in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes </s>
<s>  let the doctor play the winning game </s>
<s>  i
will play the losing one </s>
<s>  no mans life here is worth purchase </s>
<s>  any one

stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend

you need have good cards sir said the spy </s>

french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
english government the enemy of france and freedom </s>

card </s>

he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy and

such heads of information concerning doctor manettes imprisonment

familiar conversation with the defarges </s>

defarge and had broken down with them signally </s>

with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved </s>

he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over

guillotine then surely swallowed up </s>

i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to <abvr>

of which he has spoken </s>

i play my ace <abvr> barsad said carton taking the answer on himself

the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening to the

sky </s>

sparkled under it </s>

<s>  i write
it at stolen intervals under every difficulty </s>
<s>  i design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it </s>
<s>  some pitying hand may find it there when i
and my sorrows are dust </s>
<s> 

these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney mixed
with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity </s>
<s>  hope
has quite departed from my breast </s>
<s>  i know from terrible warnings i have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired but i
solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right
mindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that i write the
truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words whether they
be ever read by men or not at the eternal judgmentseat </s>
<s> 

one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think the
twentysecond of the month in the year  i was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air
at an hours distance from my place of residence in the street of the
school of medicine when a carriage came along behind me driven very
fast </s>
<s>  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down a head was put out at the window and a
voice called to the driver to stop </s>
<s> 

the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses
and the same voice called to me by my name </s>
<s>  i answered </s>
<s>  the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before i came up with it </s>
<s> 

i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to
conceal themselves </s>
<s>  as they stood side by side near the carriage door
i also observed that they both looked of about my own age or rather
younger and that they were greatly alike in stature manner voice
and as far as i could see face too </s>
<s> 

�you are doctor manette </s>
<s>  said one </s>
<s> 

i am </s>
<s> 

�doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other </s>
<s>  �the young
physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in paris </s>
<s> 

�gentlemen i returned �i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so
graciously </s>
<s> 

�we have been to your residence said the first �and not being
so fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of
overtaking you </s>
<s>  will you please to enter the carriage </s>
<s> 

the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these words
were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door </s>

they were armed </s>
<s>  i was not </s>
<s> 

�gentlemen said i �pardon me </s>
<s>  but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case to

the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second </s>
<s>  �doctor
your clients are people of condition </s>
<s>  as to the nature of the case
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it </s>
<s>  enough </s>

enter the carriage </s>
<s> 

i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence </s>

entered after methe last springing in after putting up the steps </s>
<s>  the
carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed </s>

i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred </s>

it is word for word the same </s>

place constraining my mind not to wander from the task </s>

the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the time and put my
paper in its hidingplace </s>
<s> 

        

the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and
emerged upon the country road </s>
<s>  at twothirds of a league from the
barrieri did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards
when i traversed itit struck out of the main avenue and presently
stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed to the door of the house </s>
<s>  it was not opened immediately in
answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the face </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs </s>
<s>  but the
other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in like manner
with his arm </s>
<s>  the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers </s>
<s> 

from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found
locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had
relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber </s>
<s>  i was
conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain
lying on a bed </s>
<s> 

the patient was a woman of great beauty and young </s>
<s>  assuredly not much
past twenty </s>
<s>  her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs </s>
<s>  i noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentlemans dress </s>
<s>  on one of them which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw the armorial bearings of a noble
and the letter e </s>
<s> 

i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient </s>
<s> 
for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth and was
in danger of suffocation </s>
<s>  my first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing </s>
<s>  and in moving the scarf aside the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight </s>
<s> 

i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down and looked into her face </s>
<s>  her eyes were dilated and
wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeated the
words �my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s>  and then counted up to
twelve and said �hush </s>
<s>  for an instant and no more she would pause
to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin again and she
would repeat the cry �my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s>  and
would count up to twelve and say �hush </s>
<s>  there was no variation in the
order or the manner </s>
<s>  there was no cessation but the regular moments
pause in the utterance of these sounds </s>
<s> 

�how long i asked �has this lasted </s>
<s> 

to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the
younger </s>
<s>  by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority </s>
<s>  it
was the elder who replied �since about this hour last night </s>
<s> 

�she has a husband a father and a brother </s>
<s> 

�a brother </s>
<s> 

�i do not address her brother </s>
<s> 

he answered with great contempt �no </s>
<s> 

�she has some recent association with the number twelve </s>
<s> 

the younger brother impatiently rejoined �with twelve oclock </s>
<s> 

�see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast �how
useless i am as you have brought me </s>
<s>  if i had known what i was coming
to see i could have come provided </s>
<s>  as it is time must be lost </s>
<s>  there
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place </s>
<s> 

the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily �there is
a case of medicines here </s>
<s>  and brought it from a closet and put it on
the table </s>
<s> 

        

i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my
lips </s>
<s>  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those </s>
<s> 

�do you doubt them </s>
<s>  asked the younger brother </s>
<s> 

�you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no
more </s>
<s> 

i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many
efforts the dose that i desired to give </s>
<s>  as i intended to repeat it
after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then
sat down by the side of the bed </s>
<s>  there was a timid and suppressed woman

furnishedevidently recently occupied and temporarily used </s>

old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deaden the
sound of the shrieks </s>

succession with the cry �my husband my father and my brother </s>

counting up to twelve and �hush </s>
<s>  the frenzy was so violent that i had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms </s>

them to see that they were not painful </s>

for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by

i was startled and asked �is it a pressing case </s>

�you had better see he carelessly answered </s>

the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase which
was a species of loft over a stable </s>

to a part of it </s>

there were beams across </s>

on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay a
handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most </s>
<s> 
he lay on his back with his teeth set his right hand clenched on his
breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward </s>

where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him </s>

that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point </s>
<s> 

�i am a doctor my poor fellow said i </s>
<s>  �let me examine it </s>
<s> 

�i do not want it examined he answered </s>
<s>  �let it be </s>
<s> 

it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand away </s>
<s> 
the wound was a swordthrust received from twenty to twentyfour hours
before but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay </s>
<s>  he was then dying fast </s>
<s>  as i turned my eyes to the elder
brother i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare or rabbit </s>
<s>  not at all
as if he were a fellowcreature </s>
<s> 

�how has this been done monsieur </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

�a crazed young common dog </s>
<s>  a serf </s>

and has fallen by my brothers swordlike a gentleman </s>
<s> 

there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this
answer </s>
<s>  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind </s>
<s>  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy or about his fate </s>
<s> 

the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and they now
slowly moved to me </s>
<s> 

�doctor they are very proud these nobles </s>
<s>  but we common dogs are
proud too sometimes </s>
<s>  they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us </s>
<s>  but
we have a little pride left sometimes </s>
<s>  shehave you seen her doctor </s>
<s> 

the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the
distance </s>
<s>  he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence </s>
<s> 

i said �i have seen her </s>
<s> 

�she is my sister doctor </s>
<s>  they have had their shameful rights these
nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years but we
have had good girls among us </s>
<s>  i know it and have heard my father say

<s> 
the other is his brother the worst of a bad race </s>
<s> 

it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak </s>
<s>  but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis </s>
<s> 

�we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common dogs
are by those superior beingstaxed by him without mercy obliged to
work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his mill obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat we
ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closed that his
people should not see it and take it from usi say we were so robbed
and hunted and were made so poor that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and that what we should
most pray for was that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out </s>
<s> 

i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth
like a fire </s>
<s>  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere </s>
<s>  but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in the
dying boy </s>
<s> 

�nevertheless doctor my sister married </s>
<s>  he was ailing at that time
poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottageour doghut as that man would call it </s>
<s>  she had not
been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her and admired
her and asked that man to lend her to himfor what are husbands among
us </s>
<s>  he was willing enough but my sister was good and virtuous and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine </s>
<s>  what did the two
then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her
willing </s>
<s> 

the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the
lookeron and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true </s>
<s>  the two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see even in this
bastille </s>
<s>  the gentlemans all negligent indifference </s>
<s>  the peasants all
troddendown sentiment and passionate revenge </s>
<s> 

�you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts and drive us </s>
<s>  they so harnessed him and
drove him </s>
<s>  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their
grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed </s>
<s>  they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night and ordered him back into his harness in the day </s>
<s>  but he was
not persuaded </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  taken out of harness one day at noon to feedif he
could find foodhe sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the
bell and died on her bosom </s>
<s> 

nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong </s>
<s>  he forced back the gathering shadows of death as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and to cover his
wound </s>
<s> 

�then with that mans permission and even with his aid his
brother took her away </s>
<s>  in spite of what i know she must have told his
brotherand what that is will not be long unknown to you doctor if

<s>  i saw her pass me on the road </s>
<s>  when i took the

<s>  he never spoke one of the words

<s>  i took my young sister for i have another to a place
beyond the reach of this man and where at least she will never be
his vassal </s>
<s>  then i tracked the brother here and last night climbed
ina common dog but sword in hand </s>
<s> where is the loft window </s>
<s>  it was
somewhere here </s>
<s> 

the room was darkening to his sight </s>
<s>  the world was narrowing around
him </s>
<s>  i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor as if there had been a struggle </s>
<s> 

�she heard me and ran in </s>
<s>  i told her not to come near us till he was
dead </s>
<s>  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money </s>

at me with a whip </s>

�now lift me up doctor </s>

�he </s>

<s>  where is the
man who was here </s>
<s>  turn my face to him </s>
<s> 

i did so raising the boys head against my knee </s>
<s>  but invested for the
moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely </s>
<s>  obliging
me to rise too or i could not have still supported him </s>
<s> 

�marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide and
his right hand raised �in the days when all these things are to be

twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air </s>
<s>  he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him
down dead </s>
<s> 

        

when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity </s>
<s>  i knew that this might last
for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave </s>
<s> 

i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced </s>
<s>  she never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words </s>

one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 

this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw her </s>
<s>  i had
come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began to
falter </s>
<s>  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity and
byandbye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead </s>
<s> 

it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long and
fearful storm </s>
<s>  i released her arms and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn </s>
<s>  it was then that i knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen </s>
<s>  and it was then that i lost the little hope i had
had of her </s>
<s> 

�is she dead </s>
<s>  asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the
elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse </s>
<s> 

�not dead said i </s>
<s>  �but like to die </s>
<s> 

�what strength there is in these common bodies </s>
<s>  he said looking down
at her with some curiosity </s>
<s> 

�there is prodigious strength i answered him �in sorrow and
despair </s>
<s> 

he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them </s>
<s>  he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in a
subdued voice

�doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds i
recommended that your aid should be invited </s>
<s>  your reputation is high

�monsieur said i �in my profession the communications of patients

resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me </s>

failure in my memory </s>

syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to her lips </s>

asked me where she was and i told her </s>

<s>  it
was in vain that i asked her for her family name </s>
<s>  she faintly shook her
head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done </s>

i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told the
brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day </s>
<s>  until
then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously sat behind

<s> 

i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and that
peasant a boy </s>
<s>  the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family and was ridiculous </s>
<s>  as often as i caught the younger
brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply
for knowing what i knew from the boy </s>
<s>  he was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder </s>
<s>  but i saw this </s>
<s>  i also saw that i was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder too </s>

answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her </s>
<s>  i was alone
with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended </s>

the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient to ride
away </s>

their ridingwhips and loitering up and down </s>
<s> 

�at last she is dead </s>
<s>  said the elder when i went in </s>
<s> 

�she is dead said i </s>
<s> 

�i congratulate you my brother were his words as he turned round </s>

he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking </s>

early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box with my name on the outside </s>

considered what i ought to do </s>

circumstances </s>

in my letter </s>

wife of the marquis st </s>

her greatest desire was to help that sister </s>

inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been the hope

sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go </s>
<s>  at
tellsons bankinghouse at nine he said with a musing face </s>
<s>  shall i
do well in the mean time to show myself </s>
<s>  i think so </s>
<s>  it is best that
these people should know there is such a man as i here </s>
<s>  it is a sound
precaution and may be a necessary preparation </s>
<s>  but care care care </s>
<s> 
let me think it out </s>
<s> 

checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences </s>
<s>  his first impression was
confirmed </s>
<s>  it is best he said finally resolved that these people
should know there is such a man as i here </s>
<s>  and he turned his face
towards saint antoine </s>
<s> 

defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wineshop in
the saint antoine suburb </s>
<s>  it was not difficult for one who knew the city
well to find his house without asking any question </s>
<s>  having ascertained
its situation carton came out of those closer streets again and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner </s>
<s>  for the
first time in many years he had no strong drink </s>
<s>  since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on <abvr> lorrys hearth like a man who had
done with it </s>
<s> 

it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out
into the streets again </s>
<s>  as he passed along towards saint antoine he
stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coatcollar and
his wild hair </s>
<s>  this done he went on direct to defarges and went in </s>
<s> 

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice </s>
<s>  this man whom he had seen upon
the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the
defarges man and wife </s>
<s>  the vengeance assisted in the conversation like
a regular member of the establishment </s>
<s> 

as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent
french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced
to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered </s>
<s> 

he repeated what he had already said </s>
<s> 

english </s>
<s>  asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows </s>
<s> 

after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong foreign
accent </s>
<s>  yes madame yes </s>
<s>  i am english </s>
<s> 

madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he
took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde </s>
<s> 

defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s> 

good evening </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  good evening citizen filling his glass </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  and good wine </s>
<s>  i

defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like </s>
<s> 
 madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like </s>
<s>  jacques three
pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind see you madame </s>
<s> 
 the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faith </s>
<s>  and you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slow
forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face </s>
<s>  they were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together speaking low </s>
<s>  after a silence
of a few moments during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor they resumed
their conversation </s>
<s> 

it is true what madame says observed jacques three </s>

<s>  there
is great force in that </s>
<s>  why stop </s>
<s> 

well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere </s>
<s>  after all
the question is still where </s>
<s> 

at extermination said madame </s>
<s> 

magnificent </s>
<s>  croaked jacques three </s>
<s>  the vengeance also highly
approved </s>
<s> 

extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather
troubled </s>
<s>  in general i say nothing against it </s>
<s>  but this doctor has
suffered much </s>
<s>  you have seen him today </s>
<s>  you have observed his face when
the paper was read </s>
<s> 

i have observed his face </s>
<s>  repeated madame contemptuously and angrily </s>
<s> 
yes </s>
<s>  i have observed his face </s>
<s>  i have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the republic </s>
<s>  let him take care of his face </s>
<s> 

and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner
the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him </s>
<s> 

i have observed his daughter repeated madame </s>
<s>  yes i have observed
his daughter more times than one </s>
<s>  i have observed her today and i
have observed her other days </s>
<s>  i have observed her in the court and
i have observed her in the street by the prison </s>
<s>  let me but lift my
finger </s>
<s>  she seemed to raise it the listeners eyes were always on
his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her as
if the axe had dropped </s>
<s> 

the citizeness is superb </s>
<s>  croaked the juryman </s>
<s> 

she is an angel </s>

<s> 

as to thee pursued madame implacably addressing her husband if it
depended on theewhich happily it does notthou wouldst rescue this
man even now </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  protested defarge </s>
<s>  not if to lift this glass would do it </s>
<s>  but i
would leave the matter there </s>

<s>  for other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on my register
doomed to destruction and extermination </s>

it is so assented defarge without being asked </s>

in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls he finds
this paper of today and he brings it home and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut we read it here on this spot
by the light of this lamp </s>

then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame </s>
<s>  but dont

<s> 

both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was without seeing
herand both highly commended it </s>

a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis </s>

only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply </s>

the wind and the fire where to stop </s>

<s> 

customers entered and the group was broken up </s>
<s>  the english customer
paid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and asked as
a stranger to be directed towards the national palace </s>

took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road </s>
<s> 
the english customer was not without his reflections then that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm lift it and strike under it sharp and
deep </s>
<s> 

but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall </s>
<s>  at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present
himself in <abvr> lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety </s>
<s>  he said he had been with lucie
until just now and had only left her for a few minutes to come and
keep his appointment </s>

bankinghouse towards four oclock </s>

more than five hours gone </s>

mr </s>

he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged that he
should go back to her and come to the bankinghouse again at midnight </s>

he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve </s>

did not come back </s>

brought none </s>
<s>  where could he be </s>
<s> 

they were discussing this question and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him on
the stairs </s>
<s>  the instant he entered the room it was plain that all was
lost </s>
<s> 

whether he had really been to any one or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets was never known </s>
<s>  as he stood staring at
them they asked him no question for his face told them everything </s>
<s> 

i cannot find it said he and i must have it </s>
<s>  where is it </s>
<s> 

his head and throat were bare and as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on the floor </s>
<s> 

where is my bench </s>
<s>  i have been looking everywhere for my bench and i
cant find it </s>
<s>  what have they done with my work </s>
<s>  time presses </s>

they looked at one another and their hearts died within them </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  said he in a whimpering miserable way </s>
<s>  let me get to
work </s>
<s>  give me my work </s>
<s> 

receiving no answer he tore his hair and beat his feet upon the
ground like a distracted child </s>

dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with a dreadful
cry </s>
<s>  but give me my work </s>
<s>  what is to become of us if those shoes are
not done tonight </s>
<s> 

lost utterly lost </s>
<s> 

it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him
thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder and
soothed him to sit down before the fire with a promise that he should
have his work presently </s>
<s>  he sank into the chair and brooded over the
embers and shed tears </s>
<s>  as if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy or a dream <abvr> lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping </s>
<s> 

affected and impressed with terror as they both were by this spectacle

daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed to them both
too strongly </s>

the last chance is gone </s>

<s>  he had better be taken

<s> 

i do not doubt it answered <abvr> lorry </s>

<s> 

the figure in the chair between them was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro and moaning </s>
<s>  they spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sickbed in the
night </s>
<s> 

carton stooped to pick up the coat which lay almost entangling his
feet </s>
<s>  as he did so a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on the floor </s>
<s>  carton
took it up and there was a folded paper in it </s>

at this </s>

exclaimed thank god </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> lorry eagerly </s>
<s> 

a moment </s>
<s>  let me speak of it in its place </s>
<s>  first he put his hand in
his coat and took another paper from it that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city </s>
<s>  look at it </s>
<s>  you seesydney carton
an englishman </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face </s>
<s> 

keep it for me until tomorrow </s>
<s>  i shall see him tomorrow you
remember and i had better not take it into the prison </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s>  i prefer not to do so </s>
<s>  now take this paper that doctor
manette has carried about him </s>
<s>  it is a similar certificate enabling him
and his daughter and her child at any time to pass the barrier and the
frontier </s>
<s>  you see </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil
yesterday </s>
<s>  when is it dated </s>
<s>  but no matter </s>
<s>  dont stay to look </s>

up carefully with mine and your own </s>
<s>  now observe </s>

<s> 
more probably a week afterwards </s>
<s>  you know it is a capital crime to
mourn for or sympathise with a victim of the guillotine </s>
<s>  she and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime and this woman the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described would wait to add that
strength to her case and make herself doubly sure </s>

so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say that for

you are a noble heart </s>

<s>  fiftytwo


in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the day awaited

to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea </s>
<s>  before their cells were quit of them new occupants
were appointed </s>
<s>  before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday
the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set
apart </s>
<s> 

two score and twelve were told off </s>
<s>  from the farmergeneral of seventy
whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her </s>
<s>  physical diseases engendered
in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims of all degrees </s>
<s> 
and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable suffering
intolerable oppression and heartless indifference smote equally
without distinction </s>
<s> 

charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal </s>
<s>  in every line
of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation </s>
<s>  he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that units could
avail him nothing </s>
<s> 

nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him to compose his mind to what it must bear </s>
<s>  his hold on life
was strong and it was very very hard to loosen </s>
<s>  by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter there </s>
<s>  and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded
this was closed again </s>
<s>  there was a hurry too in all his thoughts
a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended against
resignation </s>
<s>  if for a moment he did feel resigned then his wife and
child who had to live after him seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing </s>
<s> 

but all this was at first </s>
<s>  before long the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang up to stimulate
him </s>
<s>  next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet fortitude </s>
<s>  so
by degrees he calmed into the better state when he could raise his
thoughts much higher and draw comfort down </s>
<s> 

before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had
travelled thus far on his last way </s>
<s>  being allowed to purchase the means
of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished </s>

he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had known nothing

responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read </s>

already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished was the one conditionfully intelligible nowthat
her father had attached to their betrothal and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage </s>

for her fathers sake never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper or had had it recalled
to him for the moment or for good by the story of the tower on
that old sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden </s>
<s>  if he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it there could be no doubt that

discovered there and which had been described to all the world </s>
<s>  he
besought herthough he added that he knew it was needlessto console
her father by impressing him through every tender means she could think

reproach himself but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes </s>
<s>  next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing and her overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their
dear child he adjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her
father </s>
<s> 

to her father himself he wrote in the same strain </s>
<s>  but he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care </s>
<s>  and
he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending </s>
<s>

that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment all was done </s>

he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world </s>

but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining
forms </s>

flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death </s>
<s> 

thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fiftytwo heads
were to fall </s>
<s>  and now while he was composed and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his waking
thoughts which was very difficult to master </s>
<s> 

he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life </s>
<s>  how
high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he would be
stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would be dyed
red which way his face would be turned whether he would be the first
or might be the last </s>
<s>  these and many similar questions in nowise
directed by his will obtruded themselves over and over again countless
times </s>
<s>  neither were they connected with fear </s>
<s>  he was conscious of no
fear </s>
<s>  rather they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came </s>
<s>  a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred </s>
<s>  a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his than his own </s>
<s> 

the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again </s>
<s>  nine gone for ever ten gone for
ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away </s>
<s>  after a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him he had got the better of it </s>
<s>  he walked up and down softly
repeating their names to himself </s>
<s>  the worst of the strife was over </s>
<s> 
he could walk up and down free from distracting fancies praying for
himself and for them </s>
<s> 

twelve gone for ever </s>
<s> 

he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets </s>
<s>  therefore he resolved to keep two
before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others </s>
<s> 

walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast a very
different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at la force
he heard one struck away from him without surprise </s>
<s>  the hour had
measured like most other hours </s>
<s>  devoutly thankful to heaven for his
recovered selfpossession he thought there is but another now and
turned to walk again </s>
<s> 

footsteps in the stone passage outside the door </s>
<s>  he stopped </s>
<s> 

the key was put in the lock and turned </s>
<s>  before the door was opened or
as it opened a man said in a low voice in english </s>
<s>  he has never seen
me here </s>
<s>  i have kept out of his way </s>
<s>  go you in alone </s>
<s>  i wait near </s>
<s>  lose
no time </s>
<s> 

the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him
face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on his
features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton </s>
<s> 

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for the
first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining </s>
<s>  but he spoke and it was his voice </s>
<s>  he took the prisoners
hand and it was his real grasp </s>
<s>

i bring you a request from her </s>

what is it </s>
<s> 

a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well
remember </s>
<s> 

the prisoner turned his face partly aside </s>
<s> 

you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means </s>
<s>  i have
no time to tell you </s>
<s>  you must comply with ittake off those boots you
wear and draw on these of mine </s>
<s> 

there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisoner </s>
<s> 
carton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightning got
him down into it and stood over him barefoot </s>
<s>

the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he looked about
him vacantly </s>

as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention </s>

the prisoner bent over the paper once more </s>

�if it had been otherwise </s>

cartons hand moved back to his breast no more </s>

softly called enter there </s>

insensible figure putting the paper in the breast </s>

mr </s>

<s> 

the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his
forehead on his hands </s>
<s>  the spy returned immediately with two men </s>
<s> 

how then </s>
<s>  said one of them contemplating the fallen figure </s>
<s>  so
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
sainte guillotine </s>
<s> 

a good patriot said the other could hardly have been more afflicted
if the aristocrat had drawn a blank </s>
<s> 

they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door and bent to carry it away </s>
<s> 

the time is short evremonde said the spy in a warning voice </s>
<s> 

i know it well answered carton </s>
<s>  be careful of my friend i entreat
you and leave me </s>
<s> 

come then my children said barsad </s>
<s>  lift him and come away </s>
<s> 

the door closed and carton was left alone </s>
<s>  straining his powers of
listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm </s>
<s>  there was none </s>
<s>  keys turned doors clashed
footsteps passed along distant passages </s>
<s>  no cry was raised or hurry
made that seemed unusual </s>
<s>  breathing more freely in a little while he
sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two </s>
<s> 

sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then
began to be audible </s>
<s>  several doors were opened in succession and
finally his own </s>
<s>  a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in merely
saying follow me evremonde </s>
<s>  and he followed into a large dark room
at a distance </s>
<s>  it was a dark winter day and what with the shadows
within and what with the shadows without he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound </s>
<s>  some were
standing </s>
<s>  some seated </s>
<s>  some were lamenting and in restless motion </s>
<s> 
but these were few </s>
<s>  the great majority were silent and still looking
fixedly at the ground </s>
<s> 

as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fiftytwo
were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace him
as having a knowledge of him </s>
<s>  it thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery </s>
<s>  but the man went on </s>
<s>  a very few moments after that a young
woman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting and came to speak to him </s>
<s> 

citizen evremonde she said touching him with her cold hand </s>
<s>  i am a
poor little seamstress who was with you in la force </s>
<s> 

he murmured for answer </s>
<s>  true </s>
<s>  i forget what you were accused of </s>
<s> 

plots </s>
<s>  though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any </s>
<s>  is it
likely </s>
<s>  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me </s>
<s> 

the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tears
started from his eyes </s>
<s> 

i am not afraid to die citizen evremonde but i have done nothing </s>
<s>  i
am not unwilling to die if the republic which is to do so much good
to us poor will profit by my death </s>
<s>  but i do not know how that can be
citizen evremonde </s>

as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to it

i heard you were released citizen evremonde </s>

if i may ride with you citizen evremonde will you let me hold your
hand </s>
<s>  i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will give me
more courage </s>

as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in
them and then astonishment </s>

fingers and touched his lips </s>

in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury </s>

defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the woodsawyer
erst a mender of roads </s>
<s>  the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference but abided at a little distance like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required or to offer an opinion until invited </s>
<s> 

but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good
republican </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes in france </s>
<s> 

peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak </s>
<s>  my husband
fellowcitizen is a good republican and a bold man </s>
<s>  he has deserved
well of the republic and possesses its confidence </s>
<s>  but my husband has
his weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor </s>
<s> 

it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his head
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth </s>
<s>  it is not quite like a good
citizen </s>
<s>  it is a thing to regret </s>
<s> 

see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i </s>
<s>  he may wear
his head or lose it for any interest i have in him </s>
<s>  it is all one to
me </s>
<s>  but the evremonde people are to be exterminated and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father </s>
<s> 

she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three </s>
<s>  i have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson held
them up </s>
<s>  ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure </s>
<s> 

madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little </s>
<s> 

the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment
of his words has golden hair and blue eyes </s>
<s>  and we seldom have a child
there </s>
<s>  it is a pretty sight </s>
<s> 

in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction
i cannot trust my husband in this matter </s>
<s>  not only do i feel since
last night that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects </s>
<s> 
but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning
and then they might escape </s>
<s> 

that must never be croaked jacques three </s>
<s>  no one must escape </s>
<s>  we
have not half enough as it is </s>
<s>  we ought to have six score a day </s>
<s> 

in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility </s>
<s>  i must act for myself
therefore </s>
<s>  come hither little citizen </s>
<s> 

the woodsawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the
submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap </s>
<s> 

touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly
that she made to the prisoners </s>
<s>  you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day </s>
<s> 

ay ay why not </s>
<s>  cried the sawyer </s>
<s>  every day in all weathers from
two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one sometimes
without </s>
<s>  i know what i know </s>
<s>  i have seen with my eyes </s>
<s> 

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen </s>
<s> 

clearly plots said jacques three </s>
<s>  transparently </s>
<s> 

there is no doubt of the jury </s>
<s>  inquired madame defarge letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile </s>
<s> 

rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness </s>
<s>  i answer for my
fellowjurymen </s>
<s> 

now let me see said madame defarge pondering again </s>
<s>  yet once more </s>
<s> 
can i spare this doctor to my husband </s>
<s>  i have no feeling either way </s>
<s>  can
i spare him </s>
<s> 

he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice </s>
<s> 
we really have not heads enough </s>
<s>  it would be a pity i think </s>
<s> 

he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge </s>
<s>  i
cannot speak of one without the other </s>
<s>  and i must not be silent and
trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here </s>
<s>  for i am not a
bad witness </s>
<s> 

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses </s>
<s>  the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be a
celestial witness </s>
<s> 

he must take his chance said madame defarge </s>
<s>  no i cannot spare
him </s>
<s>  you are engaged at three oclock </s>
<s>  you are going to see the batch of
today executed </s>
<s> you </s>
<s> 

the question was addressed to the woodsawyer who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative </s>
<s>  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber </s>
<s>  he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been
suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of madame defarges head of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety every hour in the day </s>

i said madame am equally engaged at the same place </s>

oversay at eight tonightcome you to me in saint antoine and we
will give information against these people at my section </s>

citizeness </s>

her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among his wood and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw </s>

madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door and there expounded her further views to them thus </s>
<s> 

she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death </s>

be mourning and grieving </s>

justice of the republic </s>

<s>  exclaimed jacques
three rapturously </s>
<s>  ah my cherished </s>
<s>  cried the vengeance </s>
<s>  and
embraced her </s>
<s> 

take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her
lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat </s>
<s>  keep
me my usual chair </s>
<s>  go you there straight for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual today </s>
<s> 

i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with
alacrity and kissing her cheek </s>
<s>  you will not be late </s>
<s> 

i shall be there before the commencement </s>
<s> 

and before the tumbrils arrive </s>
<s>  be sure you are there my soul said
the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the
street before the tumbrils arrive </s>
<s> 

madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the
mud and round the corner of the prison wall </s>
<s>  the vengeance and the
juryman looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative
of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments </s>
<s> 

there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand </s>
<s>  but there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the streets </s>
<s>  of a
strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great
determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities </s>
<s>  the troubled time would have
heaved her up under any circumstances </s>
<s>  but imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong and an inveterate hatred of a class
opportunity had developed her into a tigress </s>
<s>  she was absolutely without
pity </s>
<s>  if she had ever had the virtue in her it had quite gone out of
her </s>
<s> 

it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers </s>
<s>  she saw not him but them </s>
<s>  it was nothing to her that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan </s>
<s>  that was
insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies and
her prey and as such had no right to live </s>
<s>  to appeal to her was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself </s>
<s>  if she had
been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself </s>
<s>  nor if she had
been ordered to the axe tomorrow would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there </s>
<s> 

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe </s>
<s>  carelessly
worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap </s>
<s>  lying hidden in her
bosom was a loaded pistol </s>
<s>  lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened
dagger </s>
<s>  thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such
a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood barefoot and barelegged on the brown
seasand madame defarge took her way along the streets </s>
<s> 

now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last night
the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged <abvr> lorrys
attention </s>
<s>  it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers should be reduced to the utmost </s>
<s>  since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there </s>
<s> 
finally he had proposed after anxious consideration that miss pross
and jerry who were at liberty to leave the city should leave it at
three oclock in the lightestwheeled conveyance known to that period </s>
<s> 
unencumbered with luggage they would soon overtake the coach and
passing it and preceding it on the road would order its horses in
advance and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night when delay was the most to be dreaded </s>
<s> 

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy </s>
<s>  she and jerry had
beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge
taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the
elsedeserted lodging in which they held their consultation </s>
<s> 

now what do you think <abvr> cruncher said miss pross whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or move or live </s>
<s> 
what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard </s>

carriage having already gone from here today it might awaken
suspicion </s>
<s> 

my opinion miss returned <abvr> cruncher is as youre right </s>

wot ill stand by you right or wrong </s>

i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures said
miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any plan </s>

them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man </s>
<s> 

first said <abvr> cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this never no
more will i do it never no more </s>
<s> 

i am quite sure <abvr> cruncher returned miss pross that you
never will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it

striving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it
is best that <abvr> cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence </s>
<s> o my poor darlings </s>
<s> 

i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded <abvr> cruncher with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my words
be took down and took to <abvr> cruncher through yourselfthat wot my

hope with all my heart as <abvr> cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time </s>
<s> 

there there there </s>
<s>  i hope she is my dear man cried the distracted
miss pross and i hope she finds it answering her expectations </s>
<s> 

forbid it proceeded <abvr> cruncher with additional solemnity
additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now </s>
<s>  forbid it as we shouldnt all
flop if it was anyways conwenient to get �em out o this here dismal
risk </s>
<s>  forbid it miss </s>
<s>  wot i say forbid it </s>
<s>  this was <abvr> crunchers
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one </s>
<s> 

and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
nearer and nearer </s>
<s> 

if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may rely
upon my telling <abvr> cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said </s>
<s>  and at all events
you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time </s>
<s>  now pray let us think </s>
<s>  my esteemed <abvr>
cruncher let us think </s>
<s> 

still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer
and nearer </s>
<s> 

if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me </s>
<s>  wouldnt
that be best </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher thought it might be best </s>
<s> 

where could you wait for me </s>
<s>  asked miss pross </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar </s>
<s>  alas </s>
<s>  temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed </s>
<s> 

by the cathedral door said miss pross </s>
<s>  would it be much out of
the way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two
towers </s>
<s> 

no miss answered <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s> 

then like the best of men said miss pross go to the postinghouse
straight and make that change </s>
<s> 

i am doubtful said <abvr> cruncher hesitating and shaking his head
about leaving of you you see </s>
<s>  we dont know what may happen </s>
<s> 

heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for me </s>
<s> 
take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as you can
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here </s>
<s>  i feel certain
of it </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>  bless you <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s>  thinknot of me but of the lives
that may depend on both of us </s>
<s> 

this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his decided <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s>  with an encouraging nod or two he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed </s>
<s> 

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution was a great relief to miss pross </s>
<s>  the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets was another relief </s>
<s>  she looked at her watch and it was twenty
minutes past two </s>
<s>  she had no time to lose but must get ready at once </s>
<s> 

afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes
which were swollen and red </s>
<s>  haunted by her feverish apprehensions she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her </s>
<s>  in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out for she saw a figure standing in the room </s>
<s> 

the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge </s>
<s>  by strange stern ways and through much staining blood
those feet had come to meet that water </s>
<s> 

madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evremonde </s>
<s> 
where is she </s>
<s> 

it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standing open
and would suggest the flight </s>
<s>  her first act was to shut them </s>
<s>  there were
four in the room and she shut them all </s>
<s>  she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied </s>
<s> 

madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement
and rested on her when it was finished </s>
<s>  miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her </s>
<s>  years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness
of her appearance </s>
<s>  but she too was a determined woman in her different
way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes every inch </s>
<s> 

you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss
pross in her breathing </s>
<s>  nevertheless you shall not get the better of
me </s>
<s>  i am an englishwoman </s>
<s> 

madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of
miss prosss own perception that they two were at bay </s>
<s>  she saw a tight
hard wiry woman before her as <abvr> lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand in the years gone by </s>
<s>  she knew full well that
miss pross was the familys devoted friend </s>
<s>  miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the familys malevolent enemy </s>
<s> 

on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing </s>
<s>  i
wish to see her </s>
<s> 

i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may
depend upon it ill hold my own against them </s>
<s> 

each spoke in her own language </s>
<s>  neither understood the others words </s>
<s> 
both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner what
the unintelligible words meant </s>
<s> 

it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment said madame defarge </s>
<s>  good patriots will know what that means </s>
<s> 
let me see her </s>
<s>  go tell her that i wish to see her </s>
<s>  do you hear </s>
<s> 

if those eyes of yours were bedwinches returned miss pross and i
was an english fourposter they shouldnt loose a splinter of me </s>
<s>  no
you wicked foreign woman </s>
<s>  i am your match </s>
<s> 

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail </s>
<s>  but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught </s>
<s> 

woman imbecile and piglike </s>
<s>  said madame defarge frowning </s>
<s>  i take no
answer from you </s>
<s>  i demand to see her </s>
<s>  either tell her that i demand
to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her </s>
<s> 
 this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm </s>
<s> 

i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language </s>
<s>  but i would give all i have
except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or any
part of it </s>
<s> 

neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes </s>
<s>  madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her </s>
<s>  but she now advanced one step </s>
<s> 

i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate </s>
<s>  i dont care an
english twopence for myself </s>
<s>  i know that the longer i keep you here the
greater hope there is for my ladybird </s>
<s>  ill not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me </s>
<s> 

thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath </s>
<s> 
thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life </s>
<s> 

but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes </s>
<s>  this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness </s>
<s>  ha ha </s>
<s>  she
laughed you poor wretch </s>
<s>  what are you worth </s>
<s>  i address myself to that
doctor </s>
<s>  then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor </s>
<s>  wife
of evremonde </s>
<s>  child of evremonde </s>
<s>  any person but this miserable fool
answer the citizeness defarge </s>
<s> 

perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone </s>
<s> 
three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in </s>
<s> 

those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing there
are odds and ends upon the ground </s>
<s>  there is no one in that room behind
you </s>
<s>  let me look </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer </s>
<s> 

if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and
brought back said madame defarge to herself </s>
<s> 

as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you are
uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself </s>
<s>  and you shall not
know that if i can prevent your knowing it </s>
<s>  and know that or not know
that you shall not leave here while i can hold you </s>
<s> 

i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me
i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said
madame defarge </s>
<s> 

we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard we are
not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling said miss pross </s>
<s> 

madame defarge made at the door </s>
<s>  miss pross on the instinct of the
moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her tight </s>
<s> 
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike </s>
<s>  miss pross
with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate
clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had </s>
<s>  the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face </s>
<s>  but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman </s>
<s> 

soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled
waist </s>
<s>  it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered tones you
shall not draw it </s>
<s>  i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it </s>
<s>  i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies </s>
<s> 

madame defarges hands were at her bosom </s>
<s>  miss pross looked up saw
what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood
aloneblinded with smoke </s>
<s> 

all this was in a second </s>
<s>  as the smoke cleared leaving an awful
stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground </s>
<s> 

in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help </s>
<s>  happily she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did in time to check herself and go back </s>
<s>  it was dreadful to
go in at the door again </s>
<s>  but she did go in and even went near it to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear </s>
<s>  these she put on
out on the staircase first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key </s>
<s>  she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry and then got up and hurried away </s>
<s> 

by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped </s>
<s>  by good fortune too she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman </s>
<s>  she needed both advantages for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was torn and her
dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways </s>
<s> 

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river </s>
<s>  arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and waiting there
she thought what if the key were already taken in a net what if
it were identified what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to prison and
charged with murder </s>
<s>  in the midst of these fluttering thoughts the
escort appeared took her in and took her away </s>
<s> 

is there any noise in the streets </s>
<s>  she asked him </s>
<s> 

the usual noises <abvr> cruncher replied </s>
<s>  and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect </s>
<s> 

i dont hear you said miss pross </s>
<s>  what do you say </s>
<s> 

it was in vain for <abvr> cruncher to repeat what he said </s>
<s>  miss pross could
not hear him </s>
<s>  so ill nod my head thought <abvr> cruncher amazed at
all events shell see that </s>
<s>  and she did </s>
<s> 

is there any noise in the streets now </s>
<s>  asked miss pross again
presently </s>
<s> 

again <abvr> cruncher nodded his head </s>
<s> 

i dont hear it </s>
<s> 

gone deaf in an hour </s>
<s>  said <abvr> cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed </s>
<s>  wots come to her </s>
<s> 

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life </s>
<s> 

blest if she aint in a queer condition </s>
<s>  said <abvr> cruncher more and
more disturbed </s>
<s>  wot can she have been a takin to keep her courage up </s>
<s> 
hark </s>
<s>  theres the roll of them dreadful carts </s>
<s>  you can hear that miss </s>
<s> 

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her nothing </s>
<s>  o
my good man there was first a great crash and then a great stillness
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts </s>
<s> 

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh their
journeys end said <abvr> cruncher glancing over his shoulder its my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world </s>
<s> 

and indeed she never did </s>

are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go steadily onward </s>

so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle that

<s> treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the
circumstances attending his birth

among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will
assign no fictitious name there is one anciently common to most towns

<s> </s>
<s> 

for a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all </s>
<s>  in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared </s>

pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the

workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befall a human being i do mean to say that in this
particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could
by possibility have occurred </s>

difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of
respirationa troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence </s>

little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and
the next </s>

woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer </s>

<s>  oliver and
nature fought out the point between them </s>
<s>   the result was that after
a few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise
to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed  upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter </s>

chapter ii

treats of oliver twists growth education and board

for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic
course of treachery and deception </s>
<s>   he was brought up by hand </s>
<s>   the
hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities </s>
<s>   the parish
authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether
there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a
situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of
which he stood in need </s>
<s>   the workhouse authorities replied with
humility that there was not </s>
<s>  upon this the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed
or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse
some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
against the poorlaws rolled about the floor all day without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and
for the consideration of sevenpencehalfpenny per small head per week </s>
<s> 
sevenpencehalfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child </s>
<s> 
a great deal may be got for sevenpencehalfpenny quite enough to
overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable </s>
<s>  the elderly female was
a woman of wisdom and experience </s>
<s>  she knew what was good for children </s>
<s> 
and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself </s>
<s> 
so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own
use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
allowance than was originally provided for them </s>
<s>   thereby finding in
the lowest depth a deeper still </s>
<s>  and proving herself a very great
experimental philosopher </s>
<s> 

everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who
demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw
a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
rampacious animal on nothing at all if he had not died
fourandtwenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable
bait of air </s>
<s>   unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the
female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a
similar result usually attended the operation of her system </s>
<s>  for at
the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen
in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want
and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got halfsmothered by
accident </s>
<s>  in any one of which cases the miserable little being was
usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers
it had never known in this </s>
<s> 

occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
washingthough the latter accident was very scarce anything
approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury
would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the
parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a
remonstrance </s>
<s>   but these impertinences were speedily checked by the
evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle </s>
<s>  the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was
very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
the parish wanted </s>
<s>  which was very selfdevotional </s>
<s>   besides the board
made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the
day before to say they were going </s>
<s>   the children were neat and clean
to behold when they went </s>
<s>  and what more would the people have </s>

birthday at all </s>

voice </s>

oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of <abvr> mann who had

browncloth parish cap on his head oliver was then led away by <abvr>

the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time </s>

mr </s>

<s>  little oliver firmly grasping
his goldlaced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every
quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there </s>
<s>  to these
interrogations <abvr> bumble returned very brief and snappish replies </s>

oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread when <abvr> bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old
woman returned </s>
<s>  and telling him it was a board night informed him

about the matter however </s>

lively </s>
<s>  and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large
whitewashed room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round
a table </s>
<s>   at the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher
than the rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red
face </s>

bow to the board said bumble </s>
<s>   oliver brushed away two or three
tears that were lingering in his eyes </s>

table fortunately bowed to that </s>
<s> 

whats your name boy </s>
<s>  said the gentleman in the high chair </s>
<s> 

oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him
tremble </s>
<s>  and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him
cry </s>
<s>   these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating
voice </s>
<s>  whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool </s>
<s> 
which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite
at his ease </s>

<s>   oho </s>
<s>  said the
board looking very knowing </s>
<s>  we are the fellows to set this to rights </s>
<s> 
well stop it all in no time </s>
<s>   so they established the rule that
all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel
nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house
or by a quick one out of it </s>
<s>   with this view they contracted with the
waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water </s>
<s>  and with a
cornfactor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal </s>
<s>  and
issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and
half a roll of sundays </s>
<s>   they made a great many other wise and humane
regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary
to repeat </s>
<s>  kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in
consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons </s>
<s>  and
instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had
theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a
bachelor </s>
<s>   there is no saying how many applicants for relief under
these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society
if it had not been coupled with the workhouse </s>
<s>  but the board were
longheaded men and had provided for this difficulty </s>
<s>   the relief was
inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel </s>
<s>  and that frightened
people </s>
<s> 

for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was
in full operation </s>
<s>   it was rather expensive at first in consequence of
the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in
the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their
wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel </s>
<s>   but the number of
workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers </s>
<s>  and the board were
in ecstasies </s>
<s> 

the room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a
copper at one end </s>
<s>  out of which the master dressed in an apron for the
purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at
mealtimes </s>
<s>   of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and
no moreexcept on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two
ounces and a quarter of bread besides </s>
<s> 

the bowls never wanted washing </s>
<s>   the boys polished them with their
spoons till they shone again </s>
<s>  and when they had performed this
operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large
as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager
eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
composed </s>
<s>  employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers
most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
gruel that might have been cast thereon </s>
<s>   boys have generally excellent
appetites </s>
<s>  oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months </s>
<s>  at last they got so voracious and
wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt
been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small
cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another
basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to
eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of
tender age </s>
<s>   he had a wild hungry eye </s>
<s>  and they implicitly believed
him </s>
<s>  a council was held </s>
<s>  lots were cast who should walk up to the
master after supper that evening and ask for more </s>
<s>  and it fell to
oliver twist </s>
<s> 

the evening arrived </s>
<s>  the boys took their places </s>
<s>   the master in his
cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper </s>
<s>  his pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him </s>
<s>  the gruel was served out </s>
<s>  and a long
grace was said over the short commons </s>
<s>   the gruel disappeared </s>
<s>  the boys
whispered each other and winked at oliver </s>
<s>  while his next neighbors
nudged him </s>
<s>   child as he was he was desperate with hunger and
reckless with misery </s>
<s>   he rose from the table </s>
<s>  and advancing to the
master basin and spoon in hand said </s>
<s>  somewhat alarmed at his own
temerity </s>
<s> 

please sir i want some more </s>
<s> 

the master was a fat healthy man </s>
<s>  but he turned very pale </s>
<s>  he gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then
clung for support to the copper </s>
<s>   the assistants were paralysed with
wonder </s>
<s>  the boys with fear </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said the master at length in a faint voice </s>
<s> 

please sir replied oliver i want some more </s>
<s> 

the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle </s>
<s>  pinioned him
in his arm </s>
<s>  and shrieked aloud for the beadle </s>
<s> 

the board were sitting in solemn conclave when <abvr> bumble rushed into
the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high
chair said

mr </s>

more </s>

there was a general start </s>

eaten the supper allotted by the dietary </s>

he did sir replied bumble </s>
<s> 

that boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s>   i
know that boy will be hung </s>
<s> 

nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion </s>
<s>   an animated
discussion took place </s>
<s>   oliver was ordered into instant confinement </s>
<s> 
and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering
a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the
hands of the parish </s>
<s>   in other words five pounds and oliver twist were
offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade
business or calling </s>
<s>

in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the bill
next morning </s>
<s>  i never was more convinced of anything in my life than
i am that that boy will come to be hung </s>
<s> 

as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated
gentleman was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this
narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint
just yet whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination
or no </s>

chapter iii

relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not
have been a sinecure

for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
the board </s>
<s>   it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose
that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have
established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for
ever by tying one end of his pockethandkerchief to a hook in the
wall and attaching himself to the other </s>
<s>   to the performance of this
feat however there was one obstacle </s>
<s>  namely that
pockethandkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for
all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board in council assembled </s>
<s>  solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals </s>
<s>   there was a still greater
obstacle in olivers youth and childishness </s>
<s>   he only cried bitterly
all day </s>
<s>  and when the long dismal night came on spread his little
hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the
corner tried to sleep </s>
<s>  ever and anon waking with a start and tremble
and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even
its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness
which surrounded him </s>
<s> 

let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the
period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious
consolation </s>
<s>   as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was
allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a
stone yard in the presence of <abvr> bumble who prevented his catching
cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated
applications of the cane </s>
<s>   as for society he was carried every other
day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a
public warning and example </s>
<s>   and so far from being denied the
advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same
apartment every evening at prayertime and there permitted to listen
to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys
containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the
board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented
and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver
twist </s>
<s>  whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the
exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an
article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself </s>
<s> 

it chanced one morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious
and comfortable state that <abvr> gamfield chimneysweep went his way
down the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means
of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become
rather pressing </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfields most sanguine estimate of his finances
could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount </s>
<s> 
and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately
cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his
eyes encountered the bill on the gate </s>
<s> 

woo </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gamfield to the donkey </s>
<s> 

the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction </s>
<s>  wondering probably
whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbagestalk or two when
he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
laden </s>
<s>  so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but
more particularly on his eyes </s>
<s>  and running after him bestowed a blow
on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a
donkeys </s>
<s>   then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp
wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master </s>
<s>  and
by these means turned him round </s>
<s>   he then gave him another blow on the
head just to stun him till he came back again </s>
<s>   having completed these
arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill </s>
<s> 

the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound
sentiments in the boardroom </s>
<s>   having witnessed the little dispute
between <abvr> gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that
person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that <abvr> gamfield
was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfield
smiled too as he perused the document </s>
<s>  for five pounds was just the
sum he had been wishing for </s>
<s>  and as to the boy with which it was
encumbered <abvr> gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing
for register stoves </s>
<s>   so he spelt the bill through again from
beginning to end </s>
<s>  and then touching his fur cap in token of humility
accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said <abvr>
gamfield </s>
<s> 

ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a
condescending smile </s>
<s>   what of him </s>
<s> 

if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a
good spectable chimbleysweepin bisness said <abvr> gamfield i wants
a prentis and i am ready to take him </s>
<s> 

walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfield
having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head
and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his
absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room
where oliver had first seen him </s>
<s> 

its a nasty trade said <abvr> limbkins when gamfield had again stated
his wish </s>
<s> 

young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another
gentleman </s>
<s> 

thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley
to make em come down again said gamfield </s>
<s>  thats all smoke and no
blaze </s>
<s>  vereas smoke aint o no use at all in making a boy come down
for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes </s>
<s>   boys is wery
obstinit and wery lazy genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot
blaze to make em come down vith a run </s>
<s>   its humane too genlmen
acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet
makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves </s>
<s> 

the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
explanation </s>
<s>  but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from <abvr>
limbkins </s>
<s>   the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a
few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of
expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report
published were alone audible </s>
<s>   these only chanced to be heard
indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great
emphasis </s>
<s> 

at length the whispering ceased </s>
<s>  and the members of the board having
resumed their seats and their solemnity <abvr> limbkins said </s>
<s> 

we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it </s>
<s> 

not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

decidedly not added the other members </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of
having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him
that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into
their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their
proceedings </s>
<s>  it was very unlike their general mode of doing business
if they had </s>
<s>  but still as he had no particular wish to revive the
rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the
table </s>
<s> 

so you wont let me have him genlmen </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gamfield pausing
near the door </s>
<s> 

no replied <abvr> limbkins </s>
<s>  at least as its a nasty business we
think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he
returned to the table and said

whatll you give genlmen </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   dont be too hard on a poor man </s>
<s> 
whatll you give </s>
<s> 

i should say three pound ten was plenty said <abvr> limbkins </s>

ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>

<s>  say four pound genlmen </s>
<s>   say four pound and
youve got rid of him for good and all </s>
<s>   there </s>

three pound ten repeated <abvr> limbkins firmly </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>   ill split the difference genlmen urged gamfield </s>
<s>  three
pound fifteen </s>
<s> 

not a farthing more was the firm reply of <abvr> limbkins </s>
<s> 

youre desperate hard upon me genlmen said gamfield wavering </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>   pooh </s>
<s>   nonsense </s>
<s>  said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 
hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium </s>
<s>  take him you silly
fellow </s>
<s>   hes just the boy for you </s>
<s>   he wants the stick now and then </s>

itll do him good </s>
<s>  and his board neednt come very expensive for he
hasnt been overfed since he was born </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and
observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself </s>
<s> 
the bargain was made </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was at once instructed that oliver
twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for
signature and approval that very afternoon </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive
astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself
into a clean shirt </s>
<s>   he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
performance when <abvr> bumble brought him with his own hands a basin
of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of
bread </s>
<s>  at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously </s>
<s> 
thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill
him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten
him up in that way </s>
<s> 

dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful
said <abvr> bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity </s>
<s>  youre a going to
be made a prentice of oliver </s>
<s> 

a prentice sir </s>
<s>  said the child trembling </s>
<s> 

yes oliver said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   the kind and blessed gentleman which
is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own </s>
<s>  are
a going to prentice you </s>
<s>  and to set you up in life and make a man of
you </s>
<s>  although the expense to the parish is three pound ten </s>
<s> three
pound ten oliver </s>
<s> seventy shillinsone hundred and forty
sixpences </s>
<s> and all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in
an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he
sobbed bitterly </s>
<s> 

come said <abvr> bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying
to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced </s>
<s> 
come oliver </s>
<s>   wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont
cry into your gruel </s>
<s>  thats a very foolish action oliver </s>
<s>   it
certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already </s>
<s> 

on their way to the magistrate <abvr> bumble instructed oliver that all
he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the
gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like
it very much indeed </s>
<s>  both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey </s>
<s> 
the rather as <abvr> bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in
either particular there was no telling what would be done to him </s>
<s>  when
they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself
and admonished by <abvr> bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch
him </s>
<s> 

there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour </s>
<s>   at
the expiration of which time <abvr> bumble thrust in his head unadorned
with the cocked hat and said aloud </s>
<s> 

now oliver my dear come to the gentleman </s>
<s>   as <abvr> bumble said
this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice
mind what i told you you young rascal </s>
<s> 

oliver stared innocently in <abvr> bumbles face at this somewhat
contradictory style of address </s>
<s>  but that gentleman prevented his
offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining
room </s>
<s>  the door of which was open </s>
<s>  it was a large room with a great
window </s>
<s>   behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads </s>
<s>  one
of whom was reading the newspaper </s>
<s>  while the other was perusing with
the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of
parchment which lay before him </s>
<s>   <abvr> limbkins was standing in front of
the desk on one side </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gamfield with a partially washed face
on the other </s>
<s>  while two or three blufflooking men in topboots were
lounging about </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the
little bit of parchment </s>
<s>  and there was a short pause after oliver had
been stationed by <abvr> bumble in front of the desk </s>
<s> 

this is the boy your worship said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve </s>
<s>  whereupon
the lastmentioned old gentleman woke up </s>
<s> 

oh is this the boy </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

this is him sir replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   bow to the magistrate my
dear </s>
<s> 

oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance </s>
<s>   he had been
wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all
boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards
from thenceforth on that account </s>
<s> 

well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of
chimneysweeping </s>
<s> 

he doats on it your worship replied bumble </s>
<s>  giving oliver a sly
pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt </s>
<s> 

and he will be a sweep will he </s>
<s>  inquired the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

if we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed run away
simultaneous your worship replied bumble </s>
<s> 

and this man thats to be his masteryou siryoull treat him well
and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you </s>
<s>  said the old
gentleman </s>
<s> 

when i says i will i means i will replied <abvr> gamfield doggedly </s>
<s> 

youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest
openhearted man said the old gentleman </s>
<s>  turning his spectacles in
the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villainous
countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty </s>
<s>   but the
magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably
be expected to discern what other people did </s>
<s> 

i hope i am sir said <abvr> gamfield with an ugly leer </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  fixing
his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the
inkstand </s>
<s> 

it was the critical moment of olivers fate </s>
<s>   if the inkstand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen
into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been
straightway hurried off </s>
<s>   but as it chanced to be immediately under
his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over
his desk for it without finding it </s>
<s>  and happening in the course of his
search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and
terrified face of oliver twist </s>
<s>  who despite all the admonitory looks
and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his
future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too
palpable to be mistaken even by a halfblind magistrate </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to
mr </s>
<s>  limbkins </s>
<s>  who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and
unconcerned aspect </s>
<s> 

my boy </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed </s>
<s>  what is
the matter </s>

stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate </s>
<s> 
laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of
interest </s>
<s>   now boy tell us whats the matter </s>
<s>  dont be afraid </s>
<s> 

oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that
they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve
himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with
that dreadful man </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble raising his hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  of all the artful and designing orphans
that ever i see oliver you are one of the most barefacedest </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when <abvr>
bumble had given vent to this compound adjective </s>

heard aright </s>

<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   hold your tongue </s>

mr </s>
<s>  bumble was stupefied with astonishment </s>
<s>   a beadle ordered to hold
his tongue </s>
<s>   a moral revolution </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked at his
companion he nodded significantly </s>
<s> 

we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 
tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke </s>

i hope stammered <abvr> limbkins </s>

form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child </s>

the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
matter said the second old gentleman sharply </s>
<s>   take the boy back to
the workhouse and treat him kindly </s>
<s>   he seems to want it </s>
<s> 

that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he
would be drawn and quartered into the bargain </s>
<s>  <abvr> bumble shook his
head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good </s>
<s> 
whereunto <abvr> gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him </s>
<s> 
which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem
to be a wish of a totally opposite description </s>

the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was
again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would
take possession of him </s>

chapter iv

oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public
life

in great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained
either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the
young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to
sea </s>
<s>   the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took
counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in
some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port </s>
<s>   this
suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
with him </s>
<s>  the probability being that the skipper would flog him to
death in a playful mood some day after dinner or would knock his
brains out with an iron bar </s>
<s>  both pastimes being as is pretty
generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
of that class </s>
<s>   the more the case presented itself to the board in
this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step
appeared </s>
<s>  so they came to the conclusion that the only way of
providing for oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries
with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a
cabinboy without any friends </s>
<s>  and was returning to the workhouse to
communicate the result of his mission </s>
<s>  when he encountered at the gate
no less a person than <abvr> sowerberry the parochial undertaker </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sowerberry was a tall gaunt largejointed man attired in a suit
of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour
and shoes to answer </s>
<s>   his features were not naturally intended to wear
a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional
jocosity </s>
<s>   his step was elastic and his face betokened inward
pleasantry as he advanced to <abvr> bumble and shook him cordially by
the hand </s>
<s> 

i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night <abvr>
bumble said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

youll make your fortune <abvr> sowerberry said the beadle as he
thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuffbox of the
undertaker </s>
<s>  which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin </s>
<s>   i
say youll make your fortune <abvr> sowerberry repeated <abvr> bumble
tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his
cane </s>
<s> 

think so </s>
<s>  said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half
disputed the probability of the event </s>
<s>   the prices allowed by the
board are very small <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

so are the coffins replied the beadle </s>
<s>  with precisely as near an
approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sowerberry was much tickled at this </s>
<s>  as of course he ought to be </s>
<s> 
and laughed a long time without cessation </s>
<s>   well well <abvr> bumble
he said at length theres no denying that since the new system of
feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more
shallow than they used to be </s>
<s>  but we must have some profit <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 
wellseasoned timber is an expensive article sir </s>
<s>  and all the iron
handles come by canal from birmingham </s>
<s> 

well well said <abvr> bumble every trade has its drawbacks </s>
<s>  a fair
profit is of course allowable </s>
<s> 

of course of course replied the undertaker </s>
<s>  and if i dont get a
profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the
longrun you seehe </s>

<s>  he </s>

just so said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of
observations which the beadle had interrupted </s>
<s>  though i must say <abvr>
bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage </s>
<s> 
which is that all the stout people go off the quickest </s>
<s>   the people
who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the
first to sink when they come into the house </s>
<s>  and let me tell you <abvr>
bumble that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great
hole in ones profits </s>

<s> 

as <abvr> sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an
illused man </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a
reflection on the honour of the parish </s>
<s>  the latter gentleman thought it
advisable to change the subject </s>
<s>   oliver twist being uppermost in his
mind he made him his theme </s>
<s> 

by the bye said <abvr> bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy

cane to the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words
five pounds </s>
<s>   which were printed thereon in roman capitals of
gigantic size </s>
<s> 

gadso </s>
<s>  said the undertaker </s>
<s>  taking <abvr> bumble by the giltedged
lappel of his official coat </s>
<s>  thats just the very thing i wanted to
speak to you about </s>
<s>   you knowdear me what a very elegant button this
is <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   i never noticed it before </s>
<s> 

yes i think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly
downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat </s>
<s>  the
die is the same as the porochial sealthe good samaritan healing the
sick and bruised man </s>
<s>  the board presented it to me on newyears
morning <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   i put it on i remember for the first time
to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway
at midnight </s>
<s> 

i recollect said the undertaker </s>
<s>  the jury brought it in died from
exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life
didnt they </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded </s>
<s> 

and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by
adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had

tush </s>
<s>   foolery </s>
<s>  interposed the beadle </s>
<s>   if the board attended to all
the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do </s>
<s> 

very true said the undertaker </s>
<s>  they would indeed </s>
<s> 

juries said <abvr> bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont
when working into a passion </s>
<s>  juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling
wretches </s>
<s> 

so they are said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than
that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously </s>
<s> 

no more they have acquiesced the undertaker </s>
<s> 

i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face </s>
<s> 

so do i rejoined the undertaker </s>
<s> 

and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for
a week or two said the beadle </s>
<s>  the rules and regulations of the
board would soon bring their spirit down for em </s>
<s> 

let em alone for that replied the undertaker </s>
<s>   so saying he
smiled approvingly </s>
<s>  to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish
officer </s>
<s> 

mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat </s>
<s>  took a handkerchief from the
inside of the crown </s>
<s>  wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his
rage had engendered </s>
<s>  fixed the cocked hat on again </s>
<s>  and turning to the
undertaker said in a calmer voice </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  what about the boy </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  replied the undertaker </s>
<s>  why you know <abvr> bumble i pay a good
deal towards the poors rates </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s> 

well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much
towards em ive a right to get as much out of em as i can <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s>  and soi think ill take the boy myself </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the
building </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes </s>
<s> 
and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening upon
likinga phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that
if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out
of a boy without putting too much food into him he shall have him for
a term of years to do what he likes with </s>
<s> 

when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening </s>
<s>  and
informed that he was to go that night as general houselad to a
coffinmakers </s>
<s>  and that if he complained of his situation or ever
came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be
drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so
little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened
young rascal and ordered <abvr> bumble to remove him forthwith </s>
<s> 

now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the
world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror
at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they
were rather out in this particular instance </s>
<s>   the simple fact was
that oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather
too much </s>
<s>  and was in a fair way of being reduced for life to a state
of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received </s>
<s> 
he heard the news of his destination in perfect silence </s>
<s>  and having
had his luggage put into his handwhich was not very difficult to
carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown
paper parcel about half a foot square by three inches deephe pulled
his cap over his eyes </s>
<s>  and once more attaching himself to <abvr> bumbles
coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering </s>
<s> 

for some time <abvr> bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark </s>
<s> 
for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should </s>
<s> 
and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by
the skirts of <abvr> bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to
great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush kneebreeches </s>
<s>   as
they drew near to their destination however <abvr> bumble thought it
expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for
inspection by his new master </s>
<s>  which he accordingly did with a fit and
becoming air of gracious patronage </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s>   said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice </s>
<s> 

pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir </s>
<s> 

although oliver did as he was desired at once </s>
<s>  and passed the back of
his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them
when he looked up at his conductor </s>
<s>   as <abvr> bumble gazed sternly upon
him it rolled down his cheek </s>
<s>  it was followed by another and another </s>
<s> 
the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one </s>
<s> 
withdrawing his other hand from <abvr> bumbles he covered his face with
both </s>
<s>  and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and
bony fingers </s>
<s> 

well </s>

charge a look of intense malignity </s>

<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble in amazement </s>
<s> 

so lonely sir </s>
<s>   so very lonely </s>
<s>  cried the child </s>
<s>   everybody hates
me </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  sir dont dont pray be cross to me </s>
<s>   the child beat his
hand upon his heart </s>
<s>  and looked in his companions face with tears of
real agony </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some
astonishment for a few seconds </s>
<s>  hemmed three or four times in a husky
manner </s>
<s>  and after muttering something about that troublesome cough
bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy </s>
<s>  then once more taking his
hand he walked on with him in silence </s>
<s> 

the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was
making some entries in his daybook by the light of a most appropriate
dismal candle when <abvr> bumble entered </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the undertaker </s>
<s>  looking up from the book and pausing in
the middle of a word </s>
<s>  is that you bumble </s>
<s> 

no one else <abvr> sowerberry replied the beadle </s>
<s>   here </s>

the boy </s>

oh </s>

above his head to get a better view of oliver </s>
<s>  <abvr> sowerberry will
you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and
presented the form of a short then squeezedup woman with a vixenish
countenance </s>
<s> 

my dear said <abvr> sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from
the workhouse that i told you of </s>
<s>   oliver bowed again </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  said the undertakers wife hes very small </s>
<s> 

why he is rather small replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  looking at oliver as
if it were his fault that he was no bigger </s>
<s>  he is small </s>
<s>  theres no
denying it </s>
<s>   but hell grow <abvr> sowerberryhell grow </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   i dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals
and our drink </s>
<s>   i see no saving in parish children not i </s>
<s>  for they
always cost more to keep than theyre worth </s>
<s>  however men always think
they know best </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>   get downstairs little bag o bones </s>
<s>   with
this the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed oliver down
a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark </s>
<s>  forming the
anteroom to the coalcellar and denominated kitchen </s>
<s>  wherein sat a
slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very
much out of repair </s>
<s> 

here charlotte said <abvr> sowerberry who had followed oliver down
give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip </s>
<s>   he
hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em </s>
<s>   i dare
say the boy isnt too dainty to eat emare you boy </s>
<s> 

oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was
trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative </s>
<s>  and a
plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him </s>
<s> 

i wish some wellfed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall
within him </s>
<s>  whose blood is ice whose heart is iron </s>
<s>  could have seen
oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected </s>
<s> 
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver
tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine </s>
<s>   there is only
one thing i should like better </s>
<s>  and that would be to see the
philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish </s>
<s> 

well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his
supper </s>
<s>  which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful
auguries of his future appetite </s>
<s>  have you done </s>
<s> 

there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the
affirmative </s>
<s> 

then come with me said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  taking up a dim and dirty
lamp and leading the way upstairs </s>
<s>  your beds under the counter </s>
<s>   you
dont mind sleeping among the coffins i suppose </s>
<s>  but it doesnt much
matter whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else </s>

come </s>

oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress </s>

chapter v

oliver mingles with new associates </s>
<s>   going to a funeral for the first
time he forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business

oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp
down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling
of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be
at no loss to understand </s>
<s>   an unfinished coffin on black tressels
which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and deathlike
that a cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the
direction of the dismal object </s>
<s>  from which he almost expected to see
some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror </s>
<s> 
against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm
boards cut in the same shape </s>
<s>  looking in the dim light like
highshouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets </s>
<s> 
coffinplates elmchips brightheaded nails and shreds of black
cloth lay scattered on the floor </s>
<s>  and the wall behind the counter was
ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff
neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by
four black steeds approaching in the distance </s>
<s>  the shop was close and
hot </s>
<s>   the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins </s>
<s>   the
recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust
looked like a grave </s>
<s> 

nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver </s>
<s>  he was
alone in a strange place </s>
<s>  and we all know how chilled and desolate the
best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation </s>
<s>  the boy had no
friends to care for or to care for him </s>
<s>   the regret of no recent
separation was fresh in his mind </s>
<s>  the absence of no loved and
wellremembered face sank heavily into his heart </s>
<s> 

but his heart was heavy notwithstanding </s>
<s>  and he wished as he crept
into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be
lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the
tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep
bell to soothe him in his sleep </s>
<s> 

oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of
the shopdoor </s>
<s>  which before he could huddle on his clothes was
repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twentyfive times </s>
<s> 
when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began </s>
<s> 

open the door will yer </s>
<s>  cried the voice which belonged to the legs
which had kicked at the door </s>
<s> 

i will directly sir replied oliver </s>
<s>  undoing the chain and turning
the key </s>
<s> 

i suppose yer the new boy aint yer </s>
<s>  said the voice through the
keyhole </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

how old are yer </s>
<s>  inquired the voice </s>
<s> 

ten sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

then ill whop yer when i get in said the voice </s>
<s>  you just see if i
dont thats all my workus brat </s>
<s>  and having made this obliging
promise the voice began to whistle </s>
<s> 

oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the
smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would
redeem his pledge most honourably </s>
<s>  he drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand and opened the door </s>
<s> 

for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street
and over the way </s>
<s>  impressed with the belief that the unknown who had
addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm
himself </s>
<s>  for nobody did he see but a big charityboy sitting on a post
in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter </s>
<s>  which he cut
into wedges the size of his mouth with a claspknife and then
consumed with great dexterity </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length </s>
<s>  seeing that no other
visitor made his appearance </s>
<s>  did you knock </s>
<s> 

i kicked replied the charityboy </s>
<s> 

did you want a coffin sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver innocently </s>
<s> 

at this the charityboy looked monstrous fierce </s>
<s>  and said that oliver
would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that
way </s>
<s> 

yer dont know who i am i suppose workus </s>
<s>  said the charityboy in
continuation </s>
<s>  descending from the top of the post meanwhile with
edifying gravity </s>
<s> 

no sir rejoined oliver </s>
<s> 

im mister noah claypole said the charityboy and youre under me </s>
<s> 
take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian </s>
<s>  with this <abvr>
claypole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a
dignified air which did him great credit </s>
<s>   it is difficult for a
largeheaded smalleyed youth of lumbering make and heavy
countenance to look dignified under any circumstances </s>
<s>  but it is more
especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red
nose and yellow smalls </s>
<s> 

oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in
his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a
small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the
day was graciously assisted by noah </s>
<s>  who having consoled him with the
assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sowerberry came down soon after </s>
<s>  shortly afterwards <abvr> sowerberry
appeared </s>
<s>   oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs
prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast </s>
<s> 

come near the fire noah said charlotte </s>
<s>   i saved a nice little bit
of bacon for you from masters breakfast </s>
<s>   oliver shut that door at
mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover
of the breadpan </s>
<s>   theres your tea </s>
<s>  take it away to that box and
drink it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop </s>

dye hear </s>

dye hear workus </s>

<s> 

lor noah </s>
<s>  said charlotte what a rum creature you are </s>
<s>   why dont
you let the boy alone </s>
<s> 

let him alone </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   why everybody lets him alone enough for
the matter of that </s>
<s>   neither his father nor his mother will ever
interfere with him </s>
<s>   all his relations let him have his own way pretty
well </s>
<s>   eh charlotte </s>
<s>   he </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s> 

oh you queer soul </s>
<s>  said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in
which she was joined by noah </s>
<s>  after which they both looked scornfully
at poor oliver twist as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest
corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially
reserved for him </s>
<s> 

noah was a charityboy but not a workhouse orphan </s>
<s>   no chancechild
was he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his
parents who lived hard by </s>
<s>  his mother being a washerwoman and his
father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal
pension of twopencehalfpenny and an unstateable fraction </s>
<s>   the
shopboys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding
noah in the public streets with the ignominious epithets of
leathers charity and the like </s>
<s>  and noah had bourne them without
reply </s>
<s>   but now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan at
whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on
him with interest </s>
<s>   this affords charming food for contemplation </s>
<s>   it
shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be </s>
<s>  and how
impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord
and the dirtiest charityboy </s>
<s> 

oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a
month </s>
<s>   <abvr> and <abvr> sowerberrythe shop being shut upwere taking
their supper in the little backparlour when <abvr> sowerberry after
several deferential glances at his wife said

my dear  he was going to say more </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sowerberry looking up
with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short </s>

well said <abvr> sowerberry sharply </s>
<s> 

nothing my dear nothing said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

ugh you brute </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

not at all my dear said <abvr> sowerberry humbly </s>
<s>   i thought you
didnt want to hear my dear </s>
<s>   i was only going to say

oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   i am nobody </s>
<s>  dont consult me pray </s>
<s>   i dont want to
intrude upon your secrets </s>
<s>   as <abvr> sowerberry said this she gave an
hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences </s>
<s> 

but my dear said sowerberry i want to ask your advice </s>
<s> 

no no dont ask mine replied <abvr> sowerberry in an affecting
manner </s>
<s>  ask somebody elses </s>
<s>   here there was another hysterical
laugh which frightened <abvr> sowerberry very much </s>
<s>   this is a very
common and muchapproved matrimonial course of treatment which is
often very effective </s>
<s>  it at once reduced <abvr> sowerberry to begging as
a special favour to be allowed to say what <abvr> sowerberry was most
curious to hear </s>
<s>   after a short duration the permission was most
graciously conceded </s>
<s> 

its only about young twist my dear said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  a very
goodlooking boy that my dear </s>
<s> 

he need be for he eats enough observed the lady </s>
<s> 

theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed <abvr>
sowerberry which is very interesting </s>
<s>   he would make a delightful
mute my love </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable
wonderment </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for
any observation on the good ladys part proceeded </s>
<s> 

i dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but
only for childrens practice </s>
<s>   it would be very new to have a mute in
proportion my dear </s>
<s>   you may depend upon it it would have a superb
effect </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way
was much struck by the novelty of this idea </s>
<s>  but as it would have been
compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances
she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious
suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his
proposition </s>
<s>  it was speedily determined therefore that oliver should
be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade </s>
<s>  and with this
view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of
his services being required </s>
<s> 

the occasion was not long in coming </s>
<s>   half an hour after breakfast next
morning <abvr> bumble entered the shop </s>
<s>  and supporting his cane against
the counter drew forth his large leathern pocketbook </s>
<s>  from which he
selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sowerberry </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance </s>
<s> 
an order for a coffin eh </s>
<s> 

for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied <abvr>
bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocketbook </s>
<s>  which like
himself was very corpulent </s>
<s> 

bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s>   i never heard the name before </s>
<s> 

bumble shook his head as he replied obstinate people <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>  very obstinate </s>
<s>   proud too im afraid sir </s>
<s> 

proud eh </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry with a sneer </s>
<s>   come thats too
much </s>
<s> 

oh its sickening replied the beadle </s>
<s>   antimonial <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

so it is acquiesced the undertaker </s>
<s> 

we only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle </s>
<s> 
and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman
who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial
committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was
very bad </s>
<s>   he had gone out to dinner </s>
<s>  but his prentice which is a
very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blackingbottle offhand </s>
<s> 

ah theres promptness said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

promptness indeed </s>
<s>  replied the beadle </s>
<s>   but whats the consequence </s>
<s> 
whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir </s>
<s>   why the husband
sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and
so she shant take itsays she shant take it sir </s>
<s>   good strong
wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish
labourers and a coalheaver only a week beforesent em for nothing
with a blackinbottle inand he sends back word that she shant take
it sir </s>
<s> 

as the atrocity presented itself to <abvr> bumbles mind in full force he
struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with
indignation </s>
<s> 

well said the undertaker i neverdid

never did sir </s>
<s>  ejaculated the beadle </s>
<s>   no nor nobody never did </s>
<s> 
but now shes dead weve got to bury her </s>
<s>  and thats the direction </s>
<s> 
and the sooner its done the better </s>
<s> 

thus saying <abvr> bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a
fever of parochial excitement </s>
<s>  and flounced out of the shop </s>
<s> 

why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you </s>
<s> 
said <abvr> sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the
street </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of
sight during the interview </s>
<s>  and who was shaking from head to foot at
the mere recollection of the sound of <abvr> bumbles voice </s>
<s> 

he neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from <abvr> bumbles glance
however </s>
<s>  for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman
in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that
now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better
avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years
and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish
should be thus effectually and legally overcome </s>
<s> 

well said <abvr> sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is
done the better </s>
<s>   noah look after the shop </s>
<s>  oliver put on your cap
and come with me </s>
<s>   oliver obeyed and followed his master on his
professional mission </s>
<s> 

they walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely
inhabited part of the town </s>
<s>  and then striking down a narrow street
more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused
to look for the house which was the object of their search </s>
<s>   the houses
on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by
people of the poorest class </s>
<s>  as their neglected appearance would have
sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the
squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies
half doubled occasionally skulked along </s>
<s>   a great many of the
tenements had shopfronts </s>
<s>  but these were fast closed and mouldering
away </s>
<s>  only the upper rooms being inhabited </s>
<s>   some houses which had
become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into
the street by huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly
planted in the road </s>
<s>  but even these crazy dens seemed to have been

<s>  the
very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were
hideous with famine </s>
<s> 

there was neither knocker nor bellhandle at the open door where oliver
and his master stopped </s>
<s>  so groping his way cautiously through the dark
passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the
undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs </s>
<s>   stumbling
against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles </s>

it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen </s>

at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the
apartment to which he had been directed </s>

followed him </s>

there was no fire in the room </s>
<s>  but a man was crouching mechanically
over the empty stove </s>
<s>   an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the
cold hearth and was sitting beside him </s>
<s>  there were some ragged
children in another corner </s>
<s>  and in a small recess opposite the door
there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket </s>
<s> 
oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place and crept
involuntarily closer to his master </s>
<s>  for though it was covered up the
boy felt that it was a corpse </s>

the mans face was thin and very pale </s>

remaining teeth protruded over her under lip </s>

and piercing </s>

they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside </s>
<s> 

nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the
undertaker approached the recess </s>
<s>  keep back </s>
<s>  damn you keep back if

the undertaker offered no reply to this raving </s>

scream rolled grovelling upon the floor </s>

the terrified children cried bitterly </s>

man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the
undertaker </s>

ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place </s>

yes yes said the undertakerof course </s>

disengaged himself from the old womans grasp </s>

after him hurried away </s>
<s> 

the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
halfquartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by <abvr> bumble
himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode </s>
<s>  where
mr </s>
<s>  bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the
workhouse who were to act as bearers </s>
<s>   an old black cloak had been
thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man </s>
<s>  and the bare coffin
having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers
and carried into the street </s>
<s> 

now you must put your best leg foremost old lady </s>
<s>  whispered
sowerberry in the old womans ear </s>
<s>  we are rather late </s>
<s>  and it wont
do to keep the clergyman waiting </s>
<s>   move on my menas quick as you
like </s>
<s> 

thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden </s>
<s>  and the
two mourners kept as near them as they could </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble and
sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front </s>
<s>  and oliver whose legs
were not so long as his masters ran by the side </s>
<s> 

there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as <abvr> sowerberry had
anticipated however </s>
<s>  for when they reached the obscure corner of the
churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were
made the clergyman had not arrived </s>
<s>  and the clerk who was sitting by
the vestryroom fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it
might be an hour or so before he came </s>
<s>   so they put the bier on the
brink of the grave </s>
<s>  and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the
spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at
hideandseek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by
jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry and
bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him
and read the paper </s>
<s> 

at length after a lapse of something more than an hour <abvr> bumble
and sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave </s>
<s> 
immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared </s>
<s>  putting on his surplice
as he came along </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up
appearances </s>
<s>  and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his
surplice to the clerk and walked away again </s>
<s> 

now bill </s>
<s>  said sowerberry to the gravedigger </s>
<s>  fill up </s>
<s> 

it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the
uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface </s>
<s>   the
gravedigger shovelled in the earth </s>
<s>  stamped it loosely down with his
feet </s>
<s>  shouldered his spade </s>
<s>  and walked off followed by the boys who
murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon </s>
<s> 

come my good fellow </s>
<s>  said bumble tapping the man on the back </s>
<s>  they
want to shut up the yard </s>
<s> 

the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the
grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had
addressed him walked forward for a few paces </s>
<s>  and fell down in a
swoon </s>
<s>   the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss
of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any
attention </s>

to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed
on their different ways </s>
<s> 

well oliver said sowerberry as they walked home how do you like
it </s>
<s> 

pretty well thank you sir replied oliver with considerable
hesitation </s>
<s>   not very much sir </s>
<s> 

ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sowerberry </s>
<s>  nothing
when you are used to it my boy </s>
<s> 

oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time
to get <abvr> sowerberry used to it </s>
<s>   but he thought it better not to ask
the question </s>
<s>  and walked back to the shop </s>

seen and heard </s>

chapter vi

oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and
rather astonishes him

the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed </s>
<s>   it was a nice
sickly season just at this time </s>
<s>   in commercial phrase coffins were
looking up </s>
<s>  and in the course of a few weeks oliver acquired a great
deal of experience </s>
<s>   the success of <abvr> sowerberrys ingenious
speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes </s>
<s>   the oldest
inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
prevalent or so fatal to infant existence </s>
<s>  and many were the mournful
processions which little oliver headed in a hatband reaching down to
his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town </s>
<s>   as oliver accompanied his master in most of his
adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a
finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the
beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strongminded
people bear their trials and losses </s>
<s> 

for instance </s>
<s>  when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich
old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews
and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous
illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most
public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need
bequite cheerful and contentedconversing together with as much
freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb
them </s>
<s>   husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness </s>
<s>  wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far
from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to
render it as becoming and attractive as possible </s>
<s>   it was observable
too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached
home and became quite composed before the teadrinking was over </s>
<s>   all
this was very pleasant and improving to see </s>
<s>  and oliver beheld it with
great admiration </s>
<s> 

that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
people i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence </s>
<s>  but i can most distinctly say that for
many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
illtreatment of noah claypole </s>
<s>  who used him far worse than before now
that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
black stick and hatband while he the old one remained stationary in
the muffincap and leathers </s>
<s>   charlotte treated him ill because noah
did </s>
<s>  and <abvr> sowerberry was his decided enemy because <abvr> sowerberry
was disposed to be his friend </s>
<s>  so between these three on one side and
a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in
the grain department of a brewery </s>
<s> 

and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history </s>
<s>  for i
have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance
but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future
prospects and proceedings </s>
<s> 

one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinnerhour to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a
half of the worst end of the neckwhen charlotte being called out of
the way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah claypole
being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a
worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist </s>
<s> 

intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the
tablecloth </s>
<s>  and pulled olivers hair </s>
<s>  and twitched his ears </s>
<s>  and
expressed his opinion that he was a sneak </s>
<s>  and furthermore announced
his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable
event should take place </s>
<s>  and entered upon various topics of petty
annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was </s>
<s> 
but making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still </s>
<s>  and
in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want
to be funny </s>
<s>   he got rather personal </s>
<s> 

workus said noah hows your mother </s>
<s> 

shes dead replied oliver </s>
<s>  dont you say anything about her to me </s>
<s> 

olivers colour rose as he said this </s>
<s>  he breathed quickly </s>
<s>  and there
was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which <abvr> claypole
thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying </s>
<s> 
under this impression he returned to the charge </s>
<s> 

what did she die of workus </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s> 

of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver </s>
<s> 
more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah </s>
<s>  i think i
know what it must be to die of that </s>
<s> 

tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear
rolled down olivers cheek </s>
<s>   whats set you a snivelling now </s>
<s> 

not you replied oliver sharply </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>  thats enough </s>
<s>  dont say
anything more to me about her </s>
<s>  youd better not </s>
<s> 

better not </s>
<s>  exclaimed noah </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>   better not </s>
<s>   workus dont be
impudent </s>
<s>   your mother too </s>
<s>   she was a nice un she was </s>
<s>   oh lor </s>
<s> 
and here noah nodded his head expressively </s>
<s>  and curled up as much of
his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the
occasion </s>
<s> 

yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence
and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity </s>
<s>  of all tones the most
annoying </s>
<s>  yer know workus it cant be helped now </s>
<s>  and of course yer
couldnt help it then </s>
<s>  and i am very sorry for it </s>
<s>  and im sure we all
are and pity yer very much </s>
<s>   but yer must know workus yer mother
was a regular rightdown bad un </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s>  inquired oliver looking up very quickly </s>
<s> 

a regular rightdown bad un workus replied noah coolly </s>
<s>  and
its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else
shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung </s>
<s> 
which is more likely than either isnt it </s>
<s> 

crimson with fury oliver started up </s>
<s>  overthrew the chair and table </s>
<s> 
seized noah by the throat </s>
<s>  shook him in the violence of his rage till
his teeth chattered in his head </s>
<s>  and collecting his whole force into
one heavy blow felled him to the ground </s>
<s> 

a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected
creature that harsh treatment had made him </s>
<s>   but his spirit was roused
at last </s>
<s>  the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire </s>
<s> 
his breast heaved </s>
<s>  his attitude was erect </s>
<s>  his eye bright and vivid </s>
<s> 
his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly
tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet </s>
<s>  and defied him with an
energy he had never known before </s>
<s> 

hell murder me </s>
<s>  blubbered noah </s>
<s>   charlotte </s>
<s>   missis </s>
<s>   heres the
new boy a murdering of me </s>
<s>   help </s>
<s>  help </s>
<s>   olivers gone mad </s>
<s> 
charlotte </s>
<s> 

noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a
louder from <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was
quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human
life to come further down </s>
<s> 

oh you little wretch </s>
<s>  screamed charlotte </s>
<s>  seizing oliver with her
utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man
in particularly good training </s>
<s>   oh you little ungrateful
murderous horrid villain </s>
<s>   and between every syllable charlotte
gave oliver a blow with all her might </s>
<s>  accompanying it with a scream
for the benefit of society </s>
<s> 

charlottes fist was by no means a light one </s>
<s>  but lest it should not
be effectual in calming olivers wrath <abvr> sowerberry plunged into
the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she
scratched his face with the other </s>
<s>  in this favourable position of
affairs noah rose from the ground and pommelled him behind </s>
<s> 

this was rather too violent exercise to last long </s>
<s>   when they were all
wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver
struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and
there locked him up </s>
<s>   this being done <abvr> sowerberry sunk into a
chair and burst into tears </s>
<s> 

bless her shes going off </s>
<s>  said charlotte </s>
<s>   a glass of water noah
dear </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   charlotte said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   speaking as well as she could
through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which
noah had poured over her head and shoulders </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  charlotte what a
mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  mercy indeed maam was the reply </s>
<s>   i only hope thisll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle </s>
<s>  poor noah </s>
<s>   he was
all but killed maam when i come in </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  looking piteously on the
charityboy </s>
<s> 

noah whose top waistcoatbutton might have been somewhere on a level
with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his
wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed
some affecting tears and sniffs </s>
<s> 

whats to be done </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   your masters not at
home </s>
<s>  theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in
ten minutes </s>
<s>   olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
question rendered this occurance highly probable </s>
<s> 

dear dear </s>
<s>   i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for
the policeofficers </s>
<s> 

or the millingtary suggested <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

no no said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  bethinking herself of olivers old
friend </s>
<s>   run to <abvr> bumble noah and tell him to come here directly
and not to lose a minute </s>
<s>  never mind your cap </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s>   you can
hold a knife to that black eye as you run along </s>
<s>  itll keep the
swelling down </s>
<s> 

noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed </s>
<s> 
and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a
charityboy tearing through the streets pellmell with no cap on his
head and a claspknife at his eye </s>
<s> 



chapter vii

oliver continues refractory

noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused
not once for breath until he reached the workhousegate </s>
<s>  having rested
here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an
imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket </s>
<s>  and
presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that
even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of
times started back in astonishment </s>
<s> 

why whats the matter with the boy </s>
<s>  said the old pauper </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  cried noah with wellaffected dismay </s>
<s>  and
in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of <abvr>
bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much
that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hatwhich is a very
curious and remarkable circumstance </s>
<s>  as showing that even a beadle
acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a
momentary visitation of loss of selfpossession and forgetfulness of
personal dignity </s>
<s> 

oh <abvr> bumble sir </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   oliver siroliver has

what </s>
<s>   what </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  with a gleam of pleasure in his
metallic eyes </s>
<s>  not run away </s>
<s>  he hasnt run away has he noah </s>
<s> 

no sir no </s>
<s>   not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied
noah </s>
<s>  he tried to murder me sir </s>
<s>  and then he tried to murder
charlotte </s>
<s>  and then missis </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  what dreadful pain it is </s>
<s> 

such agony please sir </s>
<s>   and here noah writhed and twisted his body
into an extensive variety of eellike positions </s>
<s>  thereby giving <abvr>
bumble to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of
oliver twist he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from
which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture </s>
<s> 

when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed
mr </s>
<s>  bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his
dreadful wounds ten times louder than before </s>
<s>  and when he observed a
gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in
his lamentations than ever </s>
<s>  rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman
aforesaid </s>
<s> 

the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted </s>
<s>  for he had not walked
three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young
cur was howling for and why <abvr> bumble did not favour him with
something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so
designated an involuntary process </s>
<s> 

its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied <abvr> bumble who
has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist </s>
<s> 

by jove </s>
<s>  exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping
short </s>
<s>   i knew it </s>
<s>   i felt a strange presentiment from the very first
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung </s>
<s> 

he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said
mr </s>
<s>  bumble with a face of ashy paleness </s>
<s> 

and his missis interposed <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

and his master too i think you said noah </s>
<s>  added <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah </s>
<s>  he said
he wanted to </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   said he wanted to did he my boy </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman in the
white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied noah </s>
<s>   and please sir missis wants to know
whether <abvr> bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog
himcause masters out </s>
<s> 

certainly my boy </s>
<s>  certainly said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat </s>
<s>  smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about
three inches higher than his own </s>
<s>   youre a good boya very good boy </s>
<s> 
heres a penny for you </s>
<s>   bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your
cane and see whats best to be done </s>
<s>  dont spare him bumble </s>
<s> 

no i will not sir replied the beadle </s>
<s>   and the cocked hat and cane
having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction <abvr>
bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
undertakers shop </s>
<s> 

here the position of affairs had not at all improved </s>
<s>   sowerberry had
not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished
vigour at the cellardoor </s>
<s>   the accounts of his ferocity as related by
mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that <abvr>
bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door </s>
<s>   with this
view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude </s>
<s>  and then
applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  you let me out </s>
<s>  replied oliver from the inside </s>
<s> 

do you know this here voice oliver </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

yes replied oliver </s>
<s> 

aint you afraid of it sir </s>
<s>   aint you atrembling while i speak
sir </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  replied oliver boldly </s>
<s> 

an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was
in the habit of receiving staggered <abvr> bumble not a little </s>
<s>   he
stepped back from the keyhole </s>
<s>  drew himself up to his full height </s>
<s>  and
looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute
astonishment </s>
<s> 

oh you know <abvr> bumble he must be mad said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you </s>
<s> 

its not madness maam replied <abvr> bumble after a few moments of
deep meditation </s>
<s>   its meat </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis </s>
<s>  youve
overfed him maam </s>
<s>   youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in
him maam unbecoming a person of his condition </s>
<s>  as the board <abvr>
sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you </s>
<s>   what have
paupers to do with soul or spirit </s>
<s>   its quite enough that we let em
have live bodies </s>
<s>   if you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would
never have happened </s>
<s> 

dear dear </s>
<s>  ejaculated <abvr> sowerberry piously raising her eyes to
the kitchen ceiling </s>
<s>  this comes of being liberal </s>
<s> 

the liberality of <abvr> sowerberry to oliver had consisted of a profuse
bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else
would eat </s>
<s>  so there was a great deal of meekness and selfdevotion in
her voluntarily remaining under <abvr> bumbles heavy accusation </s>
<s>   of
which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or
deed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth
again </s>
<s>  the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to
leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved
down </s>
<s>  and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the
apprenticeship </s>
<s>   he comes of a bad family </s>
<s>  excitable natures <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his
made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed
any welldisposed woman weeks before </s>

at this point of <abvr> bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced
kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible </s>
<s> 
sowerberry returned at this juncture </s>
<s>   olivers offence having been
explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best
calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a
twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar </s>
<s> 

olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received </s>
<s>  his face
was bruised and scratched </s>
<s>  and his hair scattered over his forehead </s>
<s> 
the angry flush had not disappeared however </s>
<s>  and when he was pulled
out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite
undismayed </s>
<s> 

now you are a nice young fellow aint you </s>
<s>  said sowerberry </s>
<s>  giving
oliver a shake and a box on the ear </s>
<s> 

he called my mother names replied oliver </s>
<s> 

well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   she deserved what he said and worse </s>

she didnt said oliver </s>

she did said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

its a lie </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry burst into a flood of tears </s>
<s> 

this flood of tears left <abvr> sowerberry no alternative </s>
<s>   if he had
hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be
quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been
according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a
brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of
a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital
within the limits of this </s>
<s> </s>
<s>   to do him justice he was as far
as his power wentit was not very extensivekindly disposed towards
the boy </s>
<s>  perhaps because it was his interest to be so </s>
<s>  perhaps
because his wife disliked him </s>
<s>  the flood of tears however left him no
resource </s>
<s>  so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even <abvr>
sowerberry herself and rendered <abvr> bumbles subsequent application of
the parochial cane rather unnecessary </s>
<s>   for the rest of the day he
was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of
bread </s>
<s>  and at night <abvr> sowerberry after making various remarks
outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his
mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of
noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed </s>
<s> 

it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings
which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a
mere child </s>
<s>   he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt </s>
<s> 
he had borne the lash without a cry </s>
<s>  for he felt that pride swelling in
his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they
had roasted him alive </s>
<s>   but now when there were none to see or hear
him he fell upon his knees on the floor </s>
<s>  and hiding his face in his
hands wept such tears as god send for the credit of our nature few
so young may ever have cause to pour out before him </s>
<s> 

for a long time oliver remained motionless in this attitude </s>
<s>  the
candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet </s>
<s>  having
gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the
fastenings of the door and looked abroad </s>
<s> 

it was a cold dark night </s>
<s>   the stars seemed to the boys eyes
farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before </s>
<s>  there was no
wind </s>
<s>  and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground
looked sepulchral and deathlike from being so still </s>
<s>  he softly
reclosed the door </s>
<s>   having availed himself of the expiring light of the
candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel
he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for morning </s>
<s> 

with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
shutters oliver arose and again unbarred the door </s>
<s>   one timid look
aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him
and was in the open street </s>
<s> 

he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly </s>
<s> 

he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up
the hill </s>
<s>   he took the same route </s>
<s>  and arriving at a footpath across
the fields </s>
<s>  which he knew after some distance led out again into the
road </s>
<s>  struck into it and walked quickly on </s>
<s> 

along this same footpath oliver wellremembered he had trotted beside
mr </s>
<s>  bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm </s>
<s> 
his way lay directly in front of the cottage </s>
<s>  his heart beat quickly
when he bethought himself of this </s>
<s>  and he half resolved to turn back </s>
<s> 
he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by
doing so </s>
<s>   besides it was so early that there was very little fear of
his being seen </s>
<s>  so he walked on </s>
<s> 

he reached the house </s>
<s>   there was no appearance of its inmates stirring
at that early hour </s>
<s>   oliver stopped and peeped into the garden </s>
<s>   a
child was weeding one of the little beds </s>
<s>  as he stopped he raised his
pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions </s>
<s> 
oliver felt glad to see him before he went </s>
<s>  for though younger than
himself he had been his little friend and playmate </s>
<s>   they had been
beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time </s>
<s> 

hush dick </s>
<s>  said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his
thin arm between the rails to greet him </s>
<s>   is any one up </s>
<s> 

nobody but me replied the child </s>
<s> 

you musnt say you saw me dick said oliver </s>
<s>   i am running away </s>
<s> 
they beat and illuse me dick </s>
<s>  and i am going to seek my fortune some
long way off </s>
<s>   i dont know where </s>
<s>   how pale you are </s>
<s> 

i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a
faint smile </s>
<s>   i am very glad to see you dear </s>
<s>  but dont stop dont
stop </s>
<s> 

yes yes i will to say goodbye to you replied oliver </s>
<s>  i shall
see you again dick </s>
<s>   i know i shall </s>
<s>   you will be well and happy </s>
<s> 

i hope so replied the child </s>
<s>   after i am dead but not before </s>
<s>   i
know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of
heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake </s>
<s> 
kiss me said the child  climbing up the low gate and flinging his
little arms round olivers neck </s>
<s>  goodbye dear </s>
<s>   god bless you </s>
<s> 

the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that
oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head </s>
<s>  and through the struggles
and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never
once forgot it </s>

chapter viii

oliver walks to london </s>
<s>   he encounters on the road a strange sort of
young gentleman

oliver reached the stile at which the bypath terminated </s>
<s>  and once more
gained the highroad </s>
<s>   it was eight oclock now </s>
<s>  though he was nearly
five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by
turns till noon </s>
<s>  fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken </s>
<s>   then
he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think
for the first time where he had better go and try to live </s>
<s> 

the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an
intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london </s>
<s>  the
name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind </s>
<s> 

london </s>
<s> that great place </s>
<s> nobodynot even <abvr> bumblecould ever
find him there </s>
<s>   he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too
say that no lad of spirit need want in london </s>
<s>  and that there were ways
of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in
country parts had no idea of </s>
<s>   it was the very place for a homeless
boy who must die in the streets unless some one helped him </s>
<s>  as these
things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again
walked forward </s>
<s> 

he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four
miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could
hope to reach his place of destination </s>
<s>  as this consideration forced
itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his
means of getting there </s>
<s>   he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and
two pairs of stockings in his bundle </s>
<s>   he had a penny tooa gift of
sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more
than ordinarily wellin his pocket </s>
<s>  a clean shirt thought oliver
is a very comfortable thing </s>
<s>  and so are two pairs of darned stockings </s>
<s> 
and so is a penny </s>
<s>  but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk
in winter time </s>
<s>   but olivers thoughts like those of most other
people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his
difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
surmounting them </s>
<s>  so after a good deal of thinking to no particular
purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and
trudged on </s>
<s> 

oliver walked twenty miles that day </s>
<s>  and all that time tasted nothing
but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he
begged at the cottagedoors by the roadside </s>
<s>   when the night came he
turned into a meadow </s>
<s>  and creeping close under a hayrick determined
to lie there till morning </s>
<s>   he felt frightened at first for the wind
moaned dismally over the empty fields </s>
<s>  and he was cold and hungry and
more alone than he had ever felt before </s>
<s>   being very tired with his
walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles </s>
<s> 

he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that
he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very
first village through which he passed </s>
<s>   he had walked no more than
twelve miles when night closed in again </s>
<s>  his feet were sore and his
legs so weak that they trembled beneath him </s>
<s>   another night passed in
the bleak damp air made him worse </s>
<s>  when he set forward on his journey
next morning he could hardly crawl along </s>
<s> 

he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and
then begged of the outside passengers </s>
<s>  but there were very few who took
any notice of him </s>
<s>  and even those told him to wait till they got to the
top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a
halfpenny </s>
<s>   poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way
but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet </s>
<s>   when
the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets
again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve
anything </s>
<s>  and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
behind </s>
<s> 

in some villages large painted boards were fixed up </s>
<s>  warning all
persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to
jail </s>
<s>   this frightened oliver very much and made him glad to get out
of those villages with all possible expedition </s>
<s>   in others he would
stand about the innyards and look mournfully at every one who passed </s>
<s> 
a proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one
of the postboys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out
of the place for she was sure he had come to steal something </s>
<s>   if he
begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him </s>
<s>  and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about
the beadlewhich brought olivers heart into his mouthvery often
the only thing he had there for many hours together </s>
<s> 

in fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpikeman and a
benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the
very same process which had put an end to his mothers </s>
<s>  in other words
he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway </s>
<s>   but
the turnpikeman gave him a meal of bread and cheese </s>
<s>  and the old lady
who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part
of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little
she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words and such
tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers
soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone </s>
<s> 

early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver
limped slowly into the little town of barnet </s>
<s>  the windowshutters were
closed </s>
<s>  the street was empty </s>
<s>  not a soul had awakened to the business
of the day </s>
<s>   the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty </s>
<s>  but the
light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation
as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep </s>
<s> 

by degrees the shutters were opened </s>
<s>  the windowblinds were drawn up </s>
<s> 
and people began passing to and fro </s>
<s>   some few stopped to gaze at
oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they
hurried by </s>
<s>  but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire
how he came there </s>
<s>  he had no heart to beg </s>
<s>  and there he sat </s>
<s> 

he had been crouching on the step for some time </s>
<s>  wondering at the great
number of publichouses every other house in barnet was a tavern
large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed
through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with
ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and
determination beyond his years to accomplish </s>
<s>  when he was roused by
observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes
before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the
opposite side of the way </s>
<s>   he took little heed of this at first </s>
<s>  but
the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long
that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look </s>
<s>   upon this
the boy crossed over </s>
<s>  and walking close up to oliver said

hullo my covey </s>
<s>   whats the row </s>
<s> 

the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his
own age </s>
<s>  but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even
seen </s>
<s>   he was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough </s>
<s>  and
as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see </s>
<s>  but he had about him all
the airs and manners of a man </s>
<s>   he was short of his age </s>
<s>  with rather
bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes </s>
<s>   his hat was stuck on the top
of his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every
momentand would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a
knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which
brought it back to its old place again </s>
<s>   he wore a mans coat which
reached nearly to his heels </s>
<s>   he had turned the cuffs back halfway up
his arm to get his hands out of the sleeves </s>
<s>  apparently with the
ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy
trousers </s>
<s>  for there he kept them </s>
<s>   he was altogether as roystering
and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six or
something less in the bluchers </s>
<s> 

hullo my covey </s>
<s>   whats the row </s>
<s>  said this strange young gentleman
to oliver </s>
<s> 

i am very hungry and tired replied oliver </s>
<s>  the tears standing in his
eyes as he spoke </s>
<s>  i have walked a long way </s>
<s>   i have been walking these
seven days </s>
<s> 

walking for sivin days </s>
<s>  said the young gentleman </s>
<s>   oh i see </s>
<s>  beaks
order eh </s>
<s>   but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i
suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion </s>
<s> 

oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth
described by the term in question </s>
<s> 

my eyes how green </s>
<s>  exclaimed the young gentleman </s>
<s>  why a beaks a
madgstrate </s>
<s>  and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight
forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin </s>
<s>   was you
never on the mill </s>
<s> 

what mill </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

what mill </s>
<s>   why the millthe mill as takes up so little room that
itll work inside a stone jug </s>
<s>  and always goes better when the winds
low with people than when its high </s>
<s>  acos then they cant get workmen </s>
<s> 
but come said the young gentleman </s>
<s>  you want grub and you shall have
it </s>
<s>   im at lowwatermark myselfonly one bob and a magpie </s>
<s>  but as
far as it goes ill fork out and stump </s>
<s>   up with you on your pins </s>
<s> 
there </s>
<s>   now then </s>
<s>  morrice </s>
<s> 

assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of readydressed ham
and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny
bran </s>
<s>  the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the
ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a
portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein </s>
<s>   taking the bread under
his arm the young gentlman turned into a small publichouse and led
the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises </s>
<s>  here a pot of beer
was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth </s>
<s>  and oliver
falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal
during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time
with great attention </s>
<s> 

going to london </s>
<s>  said the strange boy when oliver had at length
concluded </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

got any lodgings </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

money </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

the strange boy whistled </s>
<s>  and put his arms into his pockets as far as
the big coatsleeves would let them go </s>
<s> 

do you live in london </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i do when im at home replied the boy </s>
<s>  i suppose you want
some place to sleep in tonight dont you </s>
<s> 

i do indeed answered oliver </s>
<s>  i have not slept under a roof since i
left the country </s>
<s> 

dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman </s>
<s> 
ive got to be in london tonight </s>
<s>  and i know a spectable old
gentleman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and
never ask for the changethat is if any genelman he knows interduces
you </s>
<s>  and dont he know me </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s>  not in the least </s>
<s>   by no means </s>
<s> 
certainly not </s>
<s> 

the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments
of discourse were playfully ironical </s>
<s>  and finished the beer as he did
so </s>
<s> 

this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted </s>
<s> 
especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the
old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a
comfortable place without loss of time </s>
<s>   this led to a more friendly
and confidential dialogue </s>
<s>  from which oliver discovered that his
friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and
protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dawkins appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the
comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took
under his protection </s>
<s>  but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute
mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate
friends he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger
oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the
moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
him </s>
<s>   under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good
opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible </s>
<s>  and if he found
the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to
decline the honour of his farther acquaintance </s>
<s> 

as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it
was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington </s>
<s> 
they crossed from the angel into st </s>
<s>  johns road </s>
<s>  struck down the small
street which terminates at sadlers wells theatre </s>
<s>  through exmouth
street and coppice row </s>
<s>  down the little court by the side of the
workhouse </s>
<s>  across the classic ground which once bore the name of
hockleyinthehole </s>
<s>  thence into little saffron hill </s>
<s>  and so into
saffron hill the great </s>
<s>  along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace
directing oliver to follow close at his heels </s>
<s> 

although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
side of the way as he passed along </s>
<s>   a dirtier or more wretched place
he had never seen </s>
<s>   the street was very narrow and muddy and the air
was impregnated with filthy odours </s>
<s> 

there were a good many small shops </s>
<s>  but the only stock in trade
appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were
crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside </s>
<s>   the
sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the
place were the publichouses </s>
<s>  and in them the lowest orders of irish
were wrangling with might and main </s>
<s>  covered ways and yards which here
and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of
houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth </s>
<s> 
and from several of the doorways great illlooking fellows were
cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very welldisposed
or harmless errands </s>
<s> 

oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when
they reached the bottom of the hill </s>
<s>   his conductor catching him by
the arm pushed open the door of a house near field lane </s>
<s>  and drawing
him into the passage closed it behind them </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the
dodger </s>
<s> 

plummy and slam </s>
<s>  was the reply </s>
<s> 

this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right </s>
<s>  for the
light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
passage </s>
<s>  and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the
old kitchen staircase had been broken away </s>
<s> 

theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out
and shielding his eyes with his hand </s>
<s>   whos the tother one </s>
<s> 

a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward </s>
<s> 

where did he come from </s>
<s> 

greenland </s>
<s>  is fagin upstairs </s>
<s> 

yes hes a sortin the wipes </s>
<s>   up with you </s>
<s>   the candle was drawn
back and the face disappeared </s>
<s> 

oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly
grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and
broken stairs </s>
<s>  which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition
that showed he was well acquainted with them </s>
<s> 

he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him </s>
<s> 

the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and
dirt </s>
<s>   there was a deal table before the fire </s>
<s>  upon which were a
candle stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf
and butter and a plate </s>
<s>   in a fryingpan which was on the fire and
which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were
cooking </s>
<s>  and standing over them with a toastingfork in his hand was
a very old shrivelled jew whose villainouslooking and repulsive face
was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair </s>
<s>  he was dressed in a
greasy flannel gown with his throat bare </s>
<s>  and seemed to be dividing
his attention between the fryingpan and the clotheshorse over which
a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging </s>
<s>   several rough beds
made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor </s>
<s>  seated round
the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking
long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men </s>
<s> 
these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to
the jew </s>
<s>  and then turned round and grinned at oliver </s>
<s>   so did the jew
himself toastingfork in hand </s>
<s> 

this is him fagin said jack dawkins </s>
<s> my friend oliver twist </s>
<s> 

the jew grinned </s>
<s>  and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the
hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance </s>
<s> 
upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook
both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his
little bundle </s>
<s>   one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap
for him </s>
<s>  and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his
pockets in order that as he was very tired he might not have the
trouble of emptying them himself when he went to bed </s>
<s>   these
civilities would probably be extended much farther but for a liberal
exercise of the jews toastingfork on the heads and shoulders of the
affectionate youths who offered them </s>
<s> 

we are very glad to see you oliver very said the jew </s>
<s>  dodger
take off the sausages </s>
<s>  and draw a tub near the fire for oliver </s>
<s>   ah
youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s>  eh my dear </s>
<s>  there are a
good many of em aint there </s>
<s>  weve just looked em out ready for the
wash </s>
<s>  thats all oliver </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from
all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman </s>
<s>  in the midst of
which they went to supper </s>
<s> 

oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot
ginandwater </s>
<s>  telling him he must drink it off directly because
another gentleman wanted the tumbler </s>
<s>  oliver did as he was desired </s>
<s> 
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the
sacks </s>
<s>  and then he sunk into a deep sleep </s>
<s> 



chapter ix

containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman
and his hopeful pupils

it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep </s>
<s> 
there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to
himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon </s>
<s>  he would
stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below </s>
<s> 
and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and
stirring again as before </s>
<s> 

although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly
awake </s>
<s>  there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you
dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half
conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in
five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in
perfect unconsciousness </s>
<s>  at such time a mortal knows just enough of
what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its
mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space
when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate </s>
<s> 

oliver was precisely in this condition </s>
<s>  he saw the jew with his
halfclosed eyes </s>
<s>  heard his low whistling </s>
<s>  and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepans sides </s>
<s>  and yet the selfsame
senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with
almost everybody he had ever known </s>
<s> 

when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob </s>
<s> 
standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he
did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at
oliver and called him by his name </s>
<s>  he did not answer and was to all
appearances asleep </s>
<s> 

after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the
door </s>
<s>  which he fastened </s>
<s>  he then drew forth </s>
<s>  as it seemed to oliver
from some trap in the floor </s>
<s>  a small box which he placed carefully on
the table </s>
<s>  his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in </s>
<s> 
dragging an old chair to the table he sat down </s>
<s>  and took from it a
magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels </s>
<s>

<s>  said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every
feature with a hideous grin </s>
<s>  clever dogs </s>
<s>  clever dogs </s>

last </s>

<s>  fine fellows </s>
<s>  fine fellows </s>
<s> 

with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew
once more deposited the watch in its place of safety </s>
<s>  at least half a
dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed
with equal pleasure </s>
<s>  besides rings brooches bracelets and other
articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly
workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names </s>
<s> 

having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another </s>
<s>  so small that
it lay in the palm of his hand </s>
<s>  there seemed to be some very minute
inscription on it </s>
<s>  for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading
it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly </s>
<s>  at length he put
it down as if despairing of success </s>
<s>  and leaning back in his chair
muttered </s>
<s> 

what a fine thing capital punishment is </s>
<s>  dead men never repent </s>
<s>  dead
men never bring awkward stories to light </s>
<s>  ah its a fine thing for the
trade </s>
<s>  five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or
turn whitelivered </s>
<s> 

as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been
staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face </s>
<s>  the boys eyes were
fixed on his in mute curiousity </s>
<s>  and although the recognition was only
for an instantfor the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceivedit was enough to show the old man that he had been observed </s>
<s> 

he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash </s>
<s>  and laying his hand on
a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up </s>
<s>  he trembled
very much though </s>
<s>  for even in his terror oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>  what do you watch me for </s>
<s>  why are you
awake </s>
<s>  what have you seen </s>
<s>  speak out boy </s>
<s>  quickquick </s>

<s> 

i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly </s>
<s>  i am
very sorry if i have disturbed you sir </s>
<s> 

you were not awake an hour ago </s>
<s>  said the jew scowling fiercely on
the boy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s>  replied oliver </s>
<s> 

are you sure </s>
<s>  cried the jew </s>
<s>  with a still fiercer look than before </s>
<s> 
and a threatening attitude </s>
<s> 

upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly </s>
<s>  i was not
indeed sir </s>
<s> 

tush tush my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner
and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down </s>
<s>  as if to
induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport </s>
<s>  of course i
know that my dear </s>
<s>  i only tried to frighten you </s>
<s>  youre a brave boy </s>
<s> 
ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  youre a brave boy oliver </s>
<s>  the jew rubbed his hands with a
chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding </s>
<s> 

did you see any of these pretty things my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew laying
his hand upon it after a short pause </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning rather pale </s>
<s>  theytheyre mine oliver </s>
<s> 
my little property </s>
<s>  all i have to live upon in my old age </s>
<s>  the folks
call me a miser my dear </s>
<s>  only a miser </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
such a dirty place with so many watches </s>
<s>  but thinking that perhaps
his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of
money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he
might get up </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  stay </s>
<s> 
theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door </s>
<s>  bring it here </s>
<s> 
and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear </s>
<s> 

oliver got up </s>
<s>  walked across the room </s>
<s>  and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher </s>
<s>   when he turned his head the box was gone </s>
<s> 

he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying
the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when
the dodger returned </s>
<s>  accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom
oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally
introduced to him as charley bates </s>
<s>  the four sat down to breakfast on
the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought
home in the crown of his hat </s>
<s> 

well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself
to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears </s>
<s> 

hard replied the dodger </s>
<s> 

as nails added charley bates </s>
<s> 

good boys good boys </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>  what have you got dodger </s>
<s> 

a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentlman </s>
<s> 

lined </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with eagerness </s>
<s> 

pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks </s>
<s>  one
green and the other red </s>
<s> 

not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the
insides carefully </s>
<s>  but very neat and nicely made </s>
<s>   ingenious workman
aint he oliver </s>
<s> 

very indeed sir said oliver </s>
<s>  at which <abvr> charles bates laughed
uproariously </s>
<s>  very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to
laugh at in anything that had passed </s>
<s> 

and what have you got my dear </s>
<s>  said fagin to charley bates </s>
<s> 

wipes replied master bates </s>
<s>  at the same time producing four
pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s> 

well said the jew inspecting them closely </s>
<s>  theyre very good ones
very </s>
<s>  you havent marked them well though charley </s>
<s>  so the marks shall
be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it </s>
<s>  shall
us oliver eh </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

if you please sir said oliver </s>
<s> 

youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as charley
bates wouldnt you my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s> 

very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that
he burst into another laugh </s>
<s>  which laugh meeting the coffee he was
drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly
terminated in his premature suffocation </s>
<s> 

he is so jolly green </s>
<s>  said charley when he recovered as an apology
to the company for his unpolite behaviour </s>
<s> 

the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes
and said hed know better by and by </s>
<s>  upon which the old gentleman
observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking
whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning </s>
<s> 
this made him wonder more and more </s>
<s>  for it was plain from the replies
of the two boys that they had both been there </s>
<s>  and oliver naturally
wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
industrious </s>
<s> 

when the breakfast was cleared away </s>
<s>  the merry old gentlman and the two
boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in
this way </s>
<s>  the merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of
his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat
pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his shirt </s>
<s>  buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his
spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the
room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walk about the streets any hour in the day </s>
<s>   sometimes he stopped at
the fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was
staring with all his might into shopwindows </s>
<s>   at such times he would
look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping
all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a
very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran
down his face </s>
<s>   all this time the two boys followed him closely about </s>
<s> 
getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that
it was impossible to follow their motions </s>
<s>  at last the dodger trod
upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while charley bates
stumbled up against him behind </s>
<s>  and in that one moment they took from
him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase
watchguard chain shirtpin pockethandkerchief even the
spectaclecase </s>
<s>   if the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his
pockets he cried out where it was </s>
<s>  and then the game began all over
again </s>
<s> 

when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young
ladies called to see the young gentleman </s>
<s>  one of whom was named bet
and the other nancy </s>
<s>   they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly
turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings </s>
<s> 
they were not exactly pretty perhaps </s>
<s>  but they had a great deal of
colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty </s>
<s>   being
remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them
very nice girls indeed </s>
<s>   as there is no doubt they were </s>
<s> 

the visitors stopped a long time </s>
<s>  spirits were produced in consequence
of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside </s>
<s>  and
the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn </s>
<s>  at length
charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof </s>
<s> 
this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out </s>
<s>  for directly
afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went
away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with
money to spend </s>
<s> 

there my dear said fagin </s>
<s>  thats a pleasant life isnt it </s>
<s>  they
have gone out for the day </s>
<s> 

have they done work sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew </s>
<s>  that is unless they should unexpectedly come
across any when they are out </s>
<s>  and they wont neglect it if they do
my dear depend upon it </s>
<s>   make em your models my dear </s>
<s>  make em your
models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his
words </s>
<s>  do everything they bid you and take their advice in all
mattersespecially the dodgers my dear </s>
<s>  hell be a great man
himself and will make you one too if you take pattern by him </s>
<s> is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew stopping
short </s>
<s> 

yes sir said oliver </s>
<s> 

see if you can take it out without my feeling it </s>
<s>  as you saw them do
when we were at play this morning </s>
<s> 

oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen
the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with
the other </s>
<s> 

is it gone </s>
<s>  cried the jew </s>
<s> 

here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand </s>
<s> 

youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting
oliver on the head approvingly </s>
<s>  i never saw a sharper lad </s>
<s>  heres a
shilling for you </s>
<s>  if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man
of the time </s>
<s>  and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks
out of the handkerchiefs </s>
<s> 

oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to
do with his chances of being a great man </s>
<s>   but thinking that the jew
being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to
the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study </s>
<s> 



chapter x

oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new
associates </s>
<s>  and purchases experience at a high price </s>
<s>  being a short
but very important </s>
<s> in this history

for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out
of the pockethandkerchief of which a great number were brought
home and sometimes taking part in the game already described </s>
<s>  which
the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning </s>
<s>  at length
he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of
earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work
with his two companions </s>
<s> 

oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what
he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character </s>
<s> 
whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night emptyhanded
he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits </s>
<s>  and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by
sending them supperless to bed </s>
<s>  on one occasion indeed he even went
so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs </s>
<s>  but this was
carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent </s>
<s> 

at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so
eagerly sought </s>
<s>  there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two
or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre </s>
<s>  perhaps these
were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent </s>
<s>  but whether
they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the
joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger </s>
<s> 

the three boys sallied out </s>
<s>  the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up
and his hat cocked as usual </s>
<s>  master bates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets </s>
<s>  and oliver between them wondering where they
were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in
first </s>
<s> 

the pace at which they went was such a very lazy illlooking saunter
that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive
the old gentleman by not going to work at all </s>
<s>  the dodger had a
vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small
boys and tossing them down areas </s>
<s>  while charley bates exhibited some
very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering
divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and
thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that
they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction </s>
<s> 
these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring
his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could </s>
<s>  when
his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very
mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger </s>
<s> 

they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion
of terms the green </s>
<s>  when the dodger made a sudden stop </s>
<s>  and laying
his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the
greatest caution and circumspection </s>
<s> 

whats the matter </s>
<s>  demanded oliver </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  replied the dodger </s>
<s>  do you see that old cove at the
bookstall </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman over the way </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  yes i see him </s>
<s> 

hell do said the dodger </s>
<s> 

a prime plant observed master charley bates </s>
<s> 

oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise </s>
<s>  but he
was not permitted to make any inquiries </s>
<s>  for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman
towards whom his attention had been directed </s>
<s>  oliver walked a few paces
after them </s>
<s>  and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood
looking on in silent amazement </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a
powdered head and gold spectacles </s>
<s>  he was dressed in a bottlegreen
coat with a black velvet collar </s>
<s>  wore white trousers </s>
<s>  and carried a
smart bamboo cane under his arm </s>
<s>  he had taken up a book from the stall
and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his
elbowchair in his own study </s>
<s>  it is very possible that he fancied
himself there indeed </s>
<s>  for it was plain from his abstraction that he
saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short
anything but the book itself </s>
<s>  which he was reading straight through </s>
<s> 
turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at
the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest
interest and eagerness </s>
<s> 

what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking
on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the
dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from
thence a handkerchief </s>
<s>  to see him hand the same to charley bates </s>
<s>  and
finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full
speed </s>
<s> 

in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches
and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind </s>
<s> 

he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his
veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire </s>
<s>  then
confused and frightened he took to his heels </s>
<s>  and not knowing what he
did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground </s>
<s> 

this was all done in a minutes space </s>
<s>  in the very instant when oliver
began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and
missing his handkerchief turned sharp round </s>
<s>  seeing the boy scudding
away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the
depredator </s>
<s>  and shouting stop thief </s>
<s>  with all his might made off
after him book in hand </s>
<s> 

but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
hueandcry </s>
<s>  the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public
attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the
very first doorway round the corner </s>
<s>  they no sooner heard the cry and
saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they
issued forth with great promptitude </s>
<s>  and shouting stop thief </s>
<s>  too
joined in the pursuit like good citizens </s>
<s> 

although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not
theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that
selfpreservation is the first law of nature </s>
<s>  if he had been perhaps
he would have been prepared for this </s>
<s>  not being prepared however it
alarmed him the more </s>
<s>  so away he went like the wind with the old
gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  there is a magic in the sound </s>
<s>  the tradesman
leaves his counter and the carman his waggon </s>
<s>  the butcher throws down
his tray </s>
<s>  the baker his basket </s>
<s>  the milkman his pail </s>
<s>  the errandboy
his parcels </s>
<s>  the schoolboy his marbles </s>
<s>  the paviour his pickaxe </s>
<s>  the
child his battledore </s>
<s>  away they run pellmell helterskelter
slapdash </s>
<s>  tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as
they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls </s>
<s> 
and streets squares and courts reecho with the sound </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and
the crowd accumulate at every turning </s>
<s>  away they fly splashing through
the mud and rattling along the pavements </s>
<s>  up go the windows out run
the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the
very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the
shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  there is a passion for hunting something
deeply implanted in the human breast </s>
<s>   one wretched breathless child
panting with exhaustion </s>
<s>  terror in his looks </s>
<s>  agony in his eyes </s>
<s>  large
drops of perspiration streaming down his face </s>
<s>  strains every nerve to
make head upon his pursuers </s>
<s>  and as they follow on his track and gain
upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy </s>
<s> 
stop thief </s>
<s>   ay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy </s>
<s> 

stopped at last </s>
<s>   a clever blow </s>
<s>   he is down upon the pavement </s>
<s>  and the
crowd eagerly gather round him </s>
<s>   each new comer jostling and
struggling with the others to catch a glimpse </s>
<s>   stand aside </s>
<s>   give
him a little air </s>
<s>   nonsense </s>
<s>  he dont deserve it </s>
<s>   wheres the
gentleman </s>
<s>   here his is coming down the street </s>
<s>   make room there
for the gentleman </s>
<s>  is this the boy sir </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth
looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers </s>
<s> 

yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy </s>
<s> 

afraid </s>
<s>  murmured the crowd </s>
<s>   thats a good un </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said the gentleman he has hurt himself </s>
<s> 

i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward </s>
<s> 
and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth </s>
<s>   i stopped him sir </s>
<s> 

the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his
pains </s>
<s>  but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of
dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away
himself </s>
<s>   which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and
thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is
generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made
his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar </s>
<s> 

come get up said the man roughly </s>
<s> 

it wasnt me indeed sir </s>
<s>   indeed indeed it was two other boys
said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round </s>
<s>   they
are here somewhere </s>
<s> 

oh no they aint said the officer </s>
<s>   he meant this to be ironical
but it was true besides </s>
<s>  for the dodger and charley bates had filed off
down the first convenient court they came to </s>
<s> 

come get up </s>
<s> 

dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately </s>
<s> 

oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half
off his back in proof thereof </s>
<s>   come i know you </s>
<s>  it wont do </s>
<s>   will
you stand upon your legs you young devil </s>
<s> 

oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his
feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at
a rapid pace </s>
<s>   the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side </s>
<s> 
and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead
and stared back at oliver from time to time </s>
<s>   the boys shouted in
triumph </s>
<s>  and on they went </s>
<s> 



chapter xi

treats of <abvr> fang the police magistrate </s>
<s>  and furnishes a slight
specimen of his mode of administering justice

the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the
immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office </s>
<s> 
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two
or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led
beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of
summary justice by the back way </s>
<s>   it was a small paved yard into which
they turned </s>
<s>  and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  said the man carelessly </s>
<s> 

a young foglehunter replied the man who had oliver in charge </s>
<s> 

are you the party thats been robbed sir </s>
<s>  inquired the man with the
keys </s>
<s> 

yes i am replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  but i am not sure that this
boy actually took the handkerchief </s>
<s>   ii would rather not press the
case </s>
<s> 

must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man </s>
<s>  his worship
will be disengaged in half a minute </s>
<s>   now young gallows </s>
<s> 

this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he
unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell </s>
<s>   here he was
searched </s>
<s>  and nothing being found upon him locked up </s>
<s> 

this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not
so light </s>
<s>   it was most intolerably dirty </s>
<s>  for it was monday morning </s>
<s> 
and it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up
elsewhere since saturday night </s>
<s>   but this is little </s>
<s>   in our
stationhouses men and women are every night confined on the most
trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons compared with
which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried
found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces </s>
<s>  let any one who
doubts this compare the two </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated
in the lock </s>
<s>   he turned with a sigh to the book which had been the
innocent cause of all this disturbance </s>
<s> 

there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to
himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of
the book in a thoughtful manner </s>
<s>  something that touches and interests
me </s>
<s>   can he be innocent </s>
<s>   he looked likebye the bye exclaimed the
old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky
bless my soul </s>
<s> where have i seen something like that look before </s>
<s> 

after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same
meditative face into a back anteroom opening from the yard </s>
<s>  and there
retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye a vast
amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many
years </s>
<s>   no said the old gentleman shaking his head </s>
<s>  it must be
imagination </s>
<s> 

he wandered over them again </s>
<s>   he had called them into view and it was
not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them </s>
<s>   there
were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost
strangers peering intrusively from the crowd </s>
<s>  there were the faces of
young and blooming girls that were now old women </s>
<s>  there were faces that
the grave had changed and closed upon but which the mind superior to
its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling
back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming
of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond
the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be
set up as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
heaven </s>
<s> 

but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers
features bore a trace </s>
<s>   so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he
awakened </s>
<s>  and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman
buried them again in the pages of the musty book </s>
<s> 

he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man
with the keys to follow him into the office </s>
<s>   he closed his book
hastily </s>
<s>  and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the
renowned <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall </s>
<s>   <abvr> fang sat
behind a bar at the upper end </s>
<s>  and on one side the door was a sort of
wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited </s>
<s>  trembling
very much at the awfulness of the scene </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fang was a lean longbacked stiffnecked middlesized man with
no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and
sides of his head </s>
<s>   his face was stern and much flushed </s>
<s>   if he were
really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good
for him he might have brought action against his countenance for
libel and have recovered heavy damages </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman bowed respectfully </s>
<s>  and advancing to the magistrates
desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and
address sir </s>
<s>   he then withdrew a pace or two </s>
<s>  and with another
polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned </s>
<s> 

now it so happened that <abvr> fang was at that moment perusing a leading
article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent
decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth
time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state
for the home department </s>
<s>   he was out of temper </s>
<s>  and he looked up with
an angry scowl </s>
<s> 

who are you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card </s>
<s> 

officer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the
newspaper </s>
<s>   who is this fellow </s>
<s> 

my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentleman
my name sir is brownlow </s>
<s>   permit me to inquire the name of the
magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a
respectable person under the protection of the bench </s>
<s>   saying this
mr </s>
<s>  brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person
who would afford him the required information </s>
<s> 

officer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang throwing the paper on one side whats this
fellow charged with </s>
<s> 

hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer </s>
<s>  he
appears against this boy your worship </s>
<s> 

his worship knew this perfectly well </s>
<s>  but it was a good annoyance and
a safe one </s>
<s> 

appears against the boy does he </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang surveying <abvr>
brownlow contemptuously from head to foot </s>
<s>   swear him </s>
<s> 

before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 
and that is that i really never without actual experience could
have believed

hold your tongue sir </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang peremptorily </s>
<s> 

i will not sir </s>
<s>  replied the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the
office </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   youre an insolent impertinent fellow </s>
<s>   how
dare you bully a magistrate </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the old gentleman reddening </s>
<s> 

swear this person </s>
<s>  said fang to the clerk </s>
<s>   ill not hear another
word </s>
<s>   swear him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlows indignation was greatly roused </s>
<s>  but reflecting perhaps
that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it he suppressed
his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once </s>
<s> 

now said fang whats the charge against this boy </s>
<s>   what have you
got to say sir </s>
<s> 

i was standing at a bookstall <abvr> brownlow began </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue sir said <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   policeman </s>
<s>   wheres the
policeman </s>
<s>   here swear this policeman </s>
<s>   now policeman what is this </s>
<s> 

the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the
charge </s>
<s>  how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person </s>
<s> 
and how that was all he knew about it </s>
<s> 

are there any witnesses </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

none your worship replied the policeman </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to the
prosecutor said in a towering passion </s>
<s> 

do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is man or
do you not </s>
<s>   you have been sworn </s>
<s>   now if you stand there refusing to
give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench </s>
<s>  i will
by

by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailor coughed
very loud just at the right moment </s>
<s>  and the former dropped a heavy
book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being
heardaccidently of course </s>
<s> 

with many interruptions and repeated insults <abvr> brownlow contrived
to state his case </s>
<s>   observing that in the surprise of the moment he
had run after the boy because he had saw him running away </s>
<s>  and
expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him
although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he
would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow </s>
<s> 

he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion </s>
<s>  and
i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bar i
really fear that he is ill </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i dare say </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang with a sneer </s>
<s>   come none of
your tricks here you young vagabond </s>
<s>  they wont do </s>
<s>  whats your name </s>
<s> 

oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him </s>
<s>   he was deadly pale </s>
<s> 
and the whole place seemed turning round and round </s>
<s> 

whats your name you hardened scoundrel </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 
officer whats his name </s>
<s> 

this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who
was standing by the bar </s>
<s>   he bent over oliver and repeated the
inquiry </s>
<s>  but finding him really incapable of understanding the
question </s>
<s>  and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the
magistrate the more and add to the severity of his sentence </s>
<s>  he
hazarded a guess </s>
<s> 

he says his names tom white your worship said the kindhearted
thieftaker </s>
<s> 

oh he wont speak out wont he </s>
<s>  said fang </s>
<s>   very well very well </s>
<s> 
where does he live </s>
<s> 

where he can your worship replied the officer </s>
<s>  again pretending to
receive olivers answer </s>
<s> 

has he any parents </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer </s>
<s> 
hazarding the usual reply </s>
<s> 

at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head </s>
<s>  and looking
round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
water </s>
<s> 

stuff and nonsense </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   dont try to make a fool of me </s>
<s> 

i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer </s>
<s> 

i know better said <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands
instinctively </s>
<s>  hell fall down </s>
<s> 

stand away officer cried fang </s>
<s>   let him if he likes </s>
<s> 

oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in
a fainting fit </s>
<s>   the men in the office looked at each other but no one
dared to stir </s>
<s> 

i knew he was shamming said fang as if this were incontestable
proof of the fact </s>
<s>   let him lie there </s>
<s>  hell soon be tired of that </s>
<s> 

how do you propose to deal with the case sir </s>
<s>   inquired the clerk in
a low voice </s>
<s> 

summarily replied <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   he stands committed for three
monthshard labour of course </s>
<s>   clear the office </s>
<s> 

the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were
preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell </s>
<s>  when an elderly man
of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed
hastily into the office and advanced towards the bench </s>
<s> 

stop stop </s>
<s>   dont take him away </s>
<s>   for heavens sake stop a moment </s>
<s> 
cried the new comer breathless with haste </s>
<s> 

although the presiding genii in such an office as this exercise a
summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good name the
character almost the lives of her majestys subjects expecially of
the poorer class </s>
<s>  and although within such walls enough fantastic
tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping </s>
<s>  they are
closed to the public save through the medium of the daily
press </s>
<s> footnote </s>
<s>   or were virtually then </s>
<s>  <abvr> fang was consequently
not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such
irreverent disorder </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s>   who is this </s>
<s>   turn this man out </s>
<s>   clear the office </s>
<s> 
cried <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

i will speak cried the man </s>
<s>  i will not be turned out </s>
<s>   i saw it
all </s>
<s>   i keep the bookstall </s>
<s>   i demand to be sworn </s>
<s>  i will not be put
down </s>
<s>   <abvr> fang you must hear me </s>
<s>   you must not refuse sir </s>
<s> 

the man was right </s>
<s>   his manner was determined </s>
<s>  and the matter was
growing rather too serious to be hushed up </s>
<s> 

swear the man growled <abvr> fang with a very ill grace </s>
<s>  now man
what have you got to say </s>
<s> 

this said the man </s>
<s>   i saw three boys </s>
<s>   two others and the prisoner
here </s>
<s>   loitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman
was reading </s>
<s>   the robbery was committed by another boy </s>
<s>   i saw it done </s>
<s> 
and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it </s>
<s> 
having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy bookstall
keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact
circumstances of the robbery </s>
<s> 

why didnt you come here before </s>
<s>  said fang after a pause </s>
<s> 

i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man </s>
<s>   everybody who
could have helped me had joined in the pursuit </s>
<s>   i could get nobody
till five minutes ago </s>
<s>  and ive run here all the way </s>
<s> 

the prosecutor was reading was he </s>
<s>  inquired fang after another
pause </s>
<s> 

yes replied the man </s>
<s>   the very book he has in his hand </s>
<s> 

oh that book eh </s>
<s>  said fang </s>
<s>   is it paid for </s>
<s> 

no it is not replied the man with a smile </s>
<s> 

dear me i forgot all about it </s>
<s>  exclaimed the absent old gentleman
innocently </s>
<s> 

a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy </s>
<s>  said fang with
a comical effort to look humane </s>
<s>   i consider sir that you have
obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and
disreputable circumstances </s>
<s>  and you may think yourself very fortunate
that the owner of the property declines to prosecute </s>
<s>  let this be a
lesson to you my man or the law will overtake you yet </s>
<s>   the boy is
discharged </s>
<s>   clear the office </s>
<s> 

dn me </s>
<s>  cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had
kept down so long dn me </s>
<s>    ill

clear the office </s>
<s>  said the magistrate </s>
<s>   officers do you hear </s>
<s>  clear
the office </s>
<s> 

the mandate was obeyed </s>
<s>  and the indignant <abvr> brownlow was conveyed
out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other </s>
<s>   in a
perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance </s>
<s>   he reached the yard </s>
<s>  and his
passion vanished in a moment </s>
<s>   little oliver twist lay on his back on
the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with
water </s>
<s>  his face a deadly white </s>
<s>  and a cold tremble convulsing his whole
frame </s>
<s> 

poor boy poor boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow bending over him </s>
<s>  call a
coach somebody pray </s>
<s>   directly </s>
<s> 

a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on the
seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other </s>
<s> 

may i accompany you </s>
<s>  said the bookstall keeper looking in </s>
<s> 

bless me yes my dear sir said <abvr> brownlow quickly </s>
<s>   i forgot
you </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>   i have this unhappy book still </s>
<s>  jump in </s>
<s>   poor
fellow </s>
<s>   theres no time to lose </s>
<s> 

the bookstall keeper got into the coach </s>
<s>  and away they drove </s>
<s> 



chapter xii

in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before </s>
<s>  and in
which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful
friends </s>
<s> 

the coach rattled away over nearly the same ground as that which
oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the
dodger </s>
<s>  and turning a different way when it reached the angel at
islington stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady
street near pentonville </s>
<s>   here a bed was prepared without loss of
time in which <abvr> brownlow saw his young charge carefully and
comfortably deposited </s>
<s>  and here he was tended with a kindness and
solicitude that knew no bounds </s>
<s> 

but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of
his new friends </s>
<s>   the sun rose and sank and rose and sank again and
many times after that </s>
<s>  and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy
bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever </s>
<s>   the
worm does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow
creeping fire upon the living frame </s>
<s> 

weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have
been a long and troubled dream </s>
<s>   feebly raising himself in the bed
with his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously around </s>
<s> 

what room is this </s>
<s>   where have i been brought to </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  this
is not the place i went to sleep in </s>
<s> 

he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak </s>
<s> 
but they were overheard at once </s>
<s>   the curtain at the beds head was
hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely
dressed rose as she undrew it from an armchair close by in which
she had been sitting at needlework </s>
<s> 

hush my dear said the old lady softly </s>
<s>   you must be very quiet or
you will be ill again </s>
<s>  and you have been very badas bad as bad could
be pretty nigh </s>
<s>   lie down again </s>
<s>  theres a dear </s>
<s>   with those words
the old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow </s>
<s>  and
smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving
in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand in
hers and drawing it round his neck </s>
<s> 

save us </s>
<s>  said the old lady with tears in her eyes </s>
<s>   what a grateful
little dear it is </s>
<s>   pretty creetur </s>
<s>   what would his mother feel if she
had sat by him as i have and could see him now </s>
<s> 

perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands
together </s>
<s>  perhaps she has sat by me </s>
<s>   i almost feel as if she had </s>
<s> 

that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly </s>
<s> 

i suppose it was replied oliver because heaven is a long way off </s>
<s> 
and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor
boy </s>
<s>   but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there </s>
<s> 
for she was very ill herself before she died </s>
<s>   she cant know anything
about me though added oliver after a moments silence </s>
<s>   if she had
seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful </s>
<s>  and her face has always
looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her </s>
<s> 

the old lady made no reply to this </s>
<s>  but wiping her eyes first and her
spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were
part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver
to drink </s>
<s>  and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very
quiet or he would be ill again </s>
<s> 

so oliver kept very still </s>
<s>  partly because he was anxious to obey the
kind old lady in all things </s>
<s>  and partly to tell the truth because he
was completely exhausted with what he had already said </s>
<s>   he soon fell
into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a
candle </s>
<s>   which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with
a very large and loudticking gold watch in his hand who felt his
pulse and said he was a great deal better </s>
<s> 

you are a great deal better are you not my dear </s>
<s>  said the
gentleman </s>
<s> 

yes thank you sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

yes  i know you are said the gentleman </s>
<s>   youre hungry too ant
you </s>
<s> 

no sir answered oliver </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said the gentleman </s>
<s>   no i know youre not </s>
<s>   he is not hungry
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin said the gentleman </s>
<s>   looking very wise </s>
<s> 

the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to
say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man </s>
<s>  the doctor
appeared much of the same opinion himself </s>
<s> 

you feel sleepy dont you my dear </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s> 

no sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look </s>
<s>  youre
not sleepy </s>
<s>   nor thirsty </s>
<s>   are you </s>
<s> 

yes sir rather thirsty answered oliver </s>
<s> 

just as i expected <abvr> bedwin said the doctor </s>
<s>   its very natural
that he should be thirsty </s>
<s>   you may give him a little tea maam and
some dry toast without any butter </s>
<s>   dont keep him too warm maam </s>
<s>  but
be careful that you dont let him be too cold </s>
<s>  will you have the
goodness </s>
<s> 

the old lady dropped a curtsey </s>
<s>   the doctor after tasting the cool
stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away </s>
<s>   his
boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went
downstairs </s>
<s> 

oliver dozed off again soon after this </s>
<s>  when he awoke it was nearly
twelve oclock </s>
<s>   the old lady tenderly bade him goodnight shortly
afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just
come </s>
<s>   bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer book and a
large nightcap </s>
<s>  putting the latter on her head and the former on the
table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up
with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series
of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings
forward and divers moans and chokings </s>
<s>  these however had no worse
effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep
again </s>
<s> 

and thus the night crept slowly on </s>
<s>   oliver lay awake for some time
counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
rushlightshade threw upon the ceiling </s>
<s>  or tracing with his languid
eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall </s>
<s>  the darkness and
the deep stillness of the room were very solemn </s>
<s>  as they brought into
the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many
days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his
awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently
prayed to heaven </s>
<s> 

gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
suffering alone imparts </s>
<s>  that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain
to wake from </s>
<s>   who if this were death would be roused again to all
the struggles and turmoils of life </s>
<s>  to all its cares for the present </s>
<s> 
its anxieties for the future </s>
<s>  more than all its weary recollections of
the past </s>
<s> 

it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes </s>
<s>  he felt
cheerful and happy </s>
<s>   the crisis of the disease was safely past </s>
<s>   he
belonged to the world again </s>
<s> 

in three days time he was able to sit in an easychair well propped
up with pillows </s>
<s>  and as he was still too weak to walk <abvr> bedwin had
him carried downstairs into the little housekeepers room which
belonged to her </s>
<s>   having him set here by the fireside the good old
lady sat herself down too </s>
<s>  and being in a state of considerable
delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most
violently </s>
<s> 

never mind me my dear said the old lady </s>
<s>  im only having a regular
good cry </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>  its all over now </s>
<s>  and im quite comfortable </s>
<s> 

youre very very kind to me maam said oliver </s>
<s> 

well never you mind that my dear said the old lady </s>
<s>  thats got
nothing to do with your broth </s>
<s>  and its full time you had it </s>
<s>  for the
doctor says <abvr> brownlow may come in to see you this morning </s>
<s>  and we
must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell
be pleased </s>
<s>   and with this the old lady applied herself to warming
up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth </s>
<s>   strong enough oliver
thought to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation
strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest
computation </s>
<s> 

are you fond of pictures dear </s>
<s>  inquired the old lady seeing that
oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung
against the wall </s>
<s>  just opposite his chair </s>
<s> 

i dont quite know maam said oliver without taking his eyes from
the canvas </s>
<s>  i have seen so few that i hardly know </s>
<s>   what a beautiful
mild face that ladys is </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than
they are or they wouldnt get any custom child </s>
<s>  the man that invented
the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
succeed </s>
<s>  its a deal too honest </s>
<s>   a deal said the old lady laughing
very heartily at her own acuteness </s>
<s> 

isis that a likeness maam </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s> 

yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth </s>
<s> 
thats a portrait </s>
<s> 

whose maam </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s> 

why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a
goodhumoured manner </s>
<s>   its not a likeness of anybody that you or i
know i expect </s>
<s>   it seems to strike your fancy dear </s>
<s> 

it is so pretty replied oliver </s>
<s> 

why sure youre not afraid of it </s>
<s>  said the old lady </s>
<s>  observing in
great surprise the look of awe with which the child regarded the
painting </s>
<s> 

oh no no returned oliver quickly </s>
<s>  but the eyes look so sorrowful </s>
<s> 
and where i sit they seem fixed upon me </s>
<s>   it makes my heart beat
added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak
to me but couldnt </s>
<s> 

lord save us </s>
<s>  exclaimed the old lady starting </s>
<s>  dont talk in that
way child </s>
<s>   youre weak and nervous after your illness </s>
<s>  let me wheel
your chair round to the other side </s>
<s>  and then you wont see it </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s> 
said the old lady suiting the action to the word </s>
<s>  you dont see it
now at all events </s>
<s> 

oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not
altered his position </s>
<s>  but he thought it better not to worry the kind
old lady </s>
<s>  so he smiled gently when she looked at him </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bedwin
satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of
toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
preparation </s>
<s>  oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition </s>
<s>   he
had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft rap at
the door </s>
<s>   come in said the old lady </s>
<s>  and in walked <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be </s>
<s>  but he had no
sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands
behind the skirts of his dressinggown to take a good long look at
oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
contortions </s>
<s>   oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and
made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his
benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again </s>
<s> 
and the fact is if the truth must be told that <abvr> brownlows heart
being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic
process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a
condition to explain </s>
<s> 

poor boy poor boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow clearing his throat </s>
<s>  im
rather hoarse this morning <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   im afraid i have caught
cold </s>
<s> 

i hope not sir said <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   everything you have had has
been well aired sir </s>
<s> 

i dont know bedwin </s>
<s>   i dont know said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  i rather
think i had a damp napkin at dinnertime yesterday </s>
<s>  but never mind
that </s>
<s>   how do you feel my dear </s>
<s> 

very happy sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   and very grateful indeed sir for
your goodness to me </s>
<s> 

good by said <abvr> brownlow stoutly </s>
<s>   have you given him any
nourishment bedwin </s>
<s>   any slops eh </s>
<s> 

he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied <abvr>
bedwin </s>
<s>   drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the
last word </s>
<s>   to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded
there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever </s>
<s> 

ugh </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow with a slight shudder </s>
<s>  a couple of glasses
of port wine would have done him a great deal more good </s>
<s>  wouldnt they
tom white eh </s>
<s> 

my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid </s>
<s>   with a look of
great astonishment </s>
<s> 

oliver said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  oliver what </s>
<s>   oliver white eh </s>
<s> 

no sir twist oliver twist </s>
<s> 

queer name </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   what made you tell the
magistrate your name was white </s>
<s> 

i never told him so sir returned oliver in amazement </s>
<s> 

this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in olivers face </s>
<s>   it was impossible to doubt him </s>
<s> 
there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments </s>
<s> 

some mistake said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   but although his motive for
looking steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the
resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him
so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze </s>
<s> 

i hope you are not angry with me sir </s>
<s>  said oliver raising his eyes
beseechingly </s>
<s> 

no no replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>   why </s>
<s>  whats this </s>
<s>   bedwin look
there </s>
<s> 

as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over olivers head and
then to the boys face </s>
<s>   there was its living copy </s>
<s>  the eyes the head
the mouth </s>
<s>  every feature was the same </s>
<s>  the expression was for the
instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with
startling accuracy </s>
<s> 

oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation </s>
<s>  for not being
strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away </s>
<s>   a
weakness on his part which affords the narrative an opportunity of
relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils
of the merry old gentleman </s>
<s>  and of recording

that when the dodger and his accomplished friend master bates joined
in the hueandcry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence
of their executing an illegal conveyance of <abvr> brownlows personal
property as has been already described they were actuated by a very
laudable and becoming regard for themselves </s>
<s>  and forasmuch as the
freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the
first and proudest boasts of a truehearted englishman so i need
hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt
them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great
a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own
preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code
of laws which certain profound and soundjudging philosophers have laid
down as the mainsprings of all natures deeds and actions </s>
<s>   the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to
matters of maxim and theory </s>

to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight
any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling </s>

universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and
weaknesses of her sex </s>
<s> 

if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of
the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate
predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a
foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when
the general attention was fixed upon oliver </s>
<s>  and making immediately for
their home by the shortest possible cut </s>
<s>   although i do not mean to
assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages
to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being
rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and
discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken men under the
pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge </s>
<s>  still i
do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable
practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories
to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every
possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect
themselves </s>
<s>   thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong </s>
<s>  and
you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify </s>
<s>  the
amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the
distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher
concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive
and impartial view of his own particular case </s>

it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through
a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured
to halt beneath a low and dark archway </s>
<s>   having remained silent here
just long enough to recover breath to speak master bates uttered an
exclamation of amusement and delight </s>

uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and
rolled thereon in a transport of mirth </s>

whats the matter </s>

hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round </s>
<s> 
do you want to be grabbed stupid </s>
<s> 

i cant help it said charley i cant help it </s>
<s>   to see him
splitting away at that pace and cutting round the corners and
knocking up again the posts and starting on again as if he was made
of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out

<s>  the vivid imagination of master bates presented
the scene before him in too strong colours </s>

apostrophe he again rolled upon the doorstep and laughed louder than
before </s>

question </s>

what </s>

ah what </s>

why what should he say </s>

in his merriment </s>

mr </s>

the dodger made no reply </s>

the skirts of his longtailed coat under his arm thrust his tongue
into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some halfdozen times in
a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down
the court </s>

the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the
occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman as he
sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand </s>
<s>  a
pocketknife in his right </s>

rascally smile on his white face as he turned round and looking

door and listened </s>

chapter xiii

some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader
connected with whom various pleasant matters are related appertaining
to this history

wheres oliver </s>
<s>  said the jew rising with a menacing look </s>
<s>  wheres
the boy </s>
<s> 

the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his
violence </s>
<s>  and looked uneasily at each other </s>
<s>   but they made no reply </s>
<s> 

whats become of the boy </s>
<s>  said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by
the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations </s>
<s>   speak out
or ill throttle you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who
deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who
conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be
throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud
wellsustained and continuous roarsomething between a mad bull and a
speaking trumpet </s>
<s> 

will you speak </s>
<s>  thundered the jew </s>
<s>   shaking the dodger so much that
his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous </s>
<s> 

why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the
dodger sullenly </s>
<s>   come let go o me will you </s>
<s>   and swinging
himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the
jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass
at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat </s>
<s>  which if it had taken effect
would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily
replaced </s>
<s> 

the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude </s>
<s>  and
seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailants head </s>
<s>   but
charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full
at that young gentleman </s>
<s> 

why what the blazes is in the wind now </s>
<s>  growled a deep voice </s>
<s>  who
pitched that ere at me </s>
<s>   its well its the beer and not the pot as
hit me or id have settled somebody </s>
<s>   i might have knowd as nobody
but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to
throw away any drink but waterand not that unless he done the river
company every quarter </s>
<s>   wots it all about fagin </s>
<s>   dme if my
neckhandkercher ant lined with beer </s>
<s>   come in you sneaking warmint </s>
<s> 
wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master </s>
<s> 
come in </s>
<s> 

the man who growled out these words was a stoutlybuilt fellow of
about fiveandthirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab
breeches laceup half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed
a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calves </s>
<s> the kind of legs
which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete
state without a set of fetters to garnish them </s>
<s>   he had a brown hat on
his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck </s>
<s>   with the
long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he
spoke </s>
<s>   he disclosed when he had done so a broad heavy countenance
with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes </s>
<s>  one of which
displayed various particoloured symptoms of having been recently
damaged by a blow </s>
<s> 

come in dye hear </s>
<s>  growled this engaging ruffian </s>
<s> 

a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty
different places skulked into the room </s>
<s> 

why didnt you come in afore </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s>   youre getting too
proud to own me afore company are you </s>
<s>   lie down </s>
<s> 

this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the
other end of the room </s>
<s>   he appeared well used to it however </s>
<s>  for he
coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound
and winking his very illlooking eyes twenty times in a minute
appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment </s>
<s> 

what are you up to </s>
<s>   illtreating the boys you covetous avaricious
insatiable old fence </s>
<s>  said the man seating himself deliberately </s>
<s> 
i wonder they dont murder you </s>
<s>   i would if i was them </s>
<s>   if id been
your prentice id have done it long ago andno i couldnt have
sold you afterwards for youre fit for nothing but keeping as a
curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow
glass bottles large enough </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s>  <abvr> sikes said the jew trembling </s>
<s>  dont speak so loud </s>
<s> 

none of your mistering replied the ruffian </s>
<s>  you always mean
mischief when you come that </s>
<s>   you know my name </s>
<s>   out with it </s>
<s>   i shant
disgrace it when the time comes </s>
<s> 

well well thenbill sikes said the jew with abject humility </s>
<s> 
you seem out of humour bill </s>
<s> 

perhaps i am replied sikes </s>
<s>  i should think you was rather out of
sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
about as you do when you blab and

are you mad </s>
<s>  said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and
pointing towards the boys </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left
ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder </s>
<s>  a piece of dumb
show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly </s>
<s>   he then in cant
terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled
but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here
demanded a glass of liquor </s>
<s> 

and mind you dont poison it said <abvr> sikes laying his hat upon the
table </s>
<s> 

this was said in jest </s>
<s>  but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard
he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish
at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far
from the old gentlemans merry heart </s>
<s> 

after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits <abvr> sikes
condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen </s>
<s>  which gracious
act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers
capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and
improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable
under the circumstances </s>
<s> 

im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get
us into trouble </s>
<s> 

thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin </s>
<s>  youre
blowed upon fagin </s>
<s> 

and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not
noticed the interruption </s>
<s>  and regarding the other closely as he did
soim afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with
a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than
it would for me my dear </s>
<s> 

the man started and turned round upon the jew </s>
<s>   but the old
gentlemans shoulders were shrugged up to his ears </s>
<s>  and his eyes were
vacantly staring on the opposite wall </s>
<s> 

there was a long pause </s>
<s>  every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his own reflections </s>
<s>  not excepting the dog who by
a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter
in the streets when he went out </s>
<s> 

somebody must find out wots been done at the office said <abvr> sikes
in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded assent </s>
<s> 

if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes
out again said <abvr> sikes and then he must be taken care on </s>
<s>   you
must get hold of him somehow </s>
<s> 

again the jew nodded </s>
<s> 

the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious </s>
<s>  but
unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being
adopted </s>
<s>   this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and
mr </s>
<s>  william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and
deeplyrooted antipathy to going near a policeoffice on any ground or
pretext whatever </s>
<s> 

how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to
guess </s>
<s>   it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject
however </s>
<s>  for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver
had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh </s>
<s> 

the very thing </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   bet will go </s>
<s>  wont you my dear </s>
<s> 

wheres </s>
<s>  inquired the young lady </s>
<s> 

only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxingly </s>
<s> 

it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm
that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and
earnest desire to be blessed if she would </s>
<s>  a polite and delicate
evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been
possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict
upon a fellowcreature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal </s>
<s> 

the jews countenance fell </s>
<s>   he turned from this young lady who was
gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and
yellow curlpapers to the other female </s>
<s> 

nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say </s>
<s> 

that it wont do </s>
<s>  so its no use atrying it on fagin replied nancy </s>
<s> 

what do you mean by that </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes looking up in a surly
manner </s>
<s> 

what i say bill replied the lady collectedly </s>
<s> 

why youre just the very person for it reasoned <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  nobody
about here knows anything of you </s>
<s> 

and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same
composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill </s>
<s> 

shell go fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 

no she wont fagin said nancy </s>
<s> 

yes she will fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> sikes was right </s>
<s>   by dint of alternate threats promises and
bribes the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
the commission </s>
<s>   she was not indeed withheld by the same
considerations as her agreeable friend </s>
<s>  for having recently removed
into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb
of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being
recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances </s>
<s> 

accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her
curlpapers tucked up under a straw bonnetboth articles of dress
being provided from the jews inexhaustible stockmiss nancy prepared
to issue forth on her errand </s>
<s> 

stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered
basket </s>
<s>   carry that in one hand </s>
<s>   it looks more respectable my dear </s>
<s> 

give her a doorkey to carry in her tother one fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 
it looks real and genivine like </s>
<s> 

yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large
streetdoor key on the forefinger of the young ladys right hand </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  very good </s>
<s>   very good indeed my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew rubbing
his hands </s>
<s> 

oh my brother </s>
<s>   my poor dear sweet innocent little brother </s>
<s> 
exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket
and the streetdoor key in an agony of distress </s>
<s>   what has become of
him </s>
<s>   where have they taken him to </s>
<s>   oh do have pity and tell me
whats been done with the dear boy gentlemen </s>
<s>  do gentlemen if you
please gentlemen </s>
<s> 

having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heartbroken tone </s>
<s> 
to the immeasurable delight of her hearers </s>
<s>   miss nancy paused winked
to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared </s>
<s> 

ah shes a clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his
young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition
to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld </s>
<s> 

shes a honour to her sex said <abvr> sikes filling his glass and
smiting the table with his enormous fist </s>
<s>   heres her health and
wishing they was all like her </s>
<s> 

while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the
accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the
policeoffice </s>
<s>  whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity
consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she
arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards </s>
<s> 

entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the
celldoors and listened </s>
<s>   there was no sound within </s>
<s>   so she coughed
and listened again </s>
<s>   still there was no reply </s>
<s>   so she spoke </s>
<s> 

nolly dear </s>
<s>  murmured nancy in a gentle voice </s>
<s>  nolly </s>
<s> 

there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been
taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society
having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by <abvr>
fang to the house of correction for one month </s>
<s>  with the appropriate and
amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be
more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical
instrument </s>
<s>   he made no answer </s>
<s>  being occupied mentally bewailing the
loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the
county </s>
<s>   so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  cried a faint and feeble voice </s>
<s> 

is there a little boy here </s>
<s>  inquired nancy with a preliminary sob </s>
<s> 

no replied the voice </s>
<s>  god forbid </s>
<s> 

this was a vagrant of sixtyfive who was going to prison for not
playing the flute </s>
<s>  or in other words for begging in the streets and
doing nothing for his livelihood </s>
<s>   in the next cell was another man
who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without
license </s>
<s>  thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the
stampoffice </s>
<s> 

but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or
knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in
the striped waistcoat </s>
<s>  and with the most piteous wailings and
lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of
the streetdoor key and the little basket demanded her own dear
brother </s>
<s> 

i havent got him my dear said the old man </s>
<s> 

where is he </s>
<s>  screamed nancy in a distracted manner </s>
<s> 

why the gentlemans got him replied the officer </s>
<s> 

what gentleman </s>
<s>   oh gracious heavens </s>
<s>   what gentleman </s>
<s>  exclaimed
nancy </s>
<s> 

in reply to this incoherent questioning the old man informed the
deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office
and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to
have been committed by another boy not in custody </s>
<s>  and that the
prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own
residence </s>
<s>   of and concerning which all the informant knew was that
it was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in
the directions to the coachman </s>
<s> 

in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman
staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a
swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could
think of to the domicile of the jew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered
than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat
expeditiously departed </s>
<s>   without devoting any time to the formality of
wishing the company goodmorning </s>
<s> 

we must know where he is my dears </s>
<s>  he must be found said the jew
greatly excited </s>
<s>   charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring
home some news of him </s>
<s>   nancy my dear i must have him found </s>
<s>   i trust
to you my dearto you and the artful for everything </s>
<s>   stay stay
added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand </s>
<s>  theres money
my dears </s>
<s>   i shall shut up this shop tonight </s>
<s>   youll know where to
find me </s>
<s>   dont stop here a minute </s>
<s>   not an instant my dears </s>
<s> 

with these words he pushed them from the room </s>
<s>   and carefully
doublelocking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of
concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver </s>
<s> 
then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
his clothing </s>
<s> 

a rap at the door startled him in this occupation </s>
<s>   whos there </s>
<s>  he
cried in a shrill tone </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  replied the voice of the dodger through the keyhole </s>
<s> 

what now </s>
<s>  cried the jew impatiently </s>
<s> 

is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says </s>
<s>  inquired the
dodger </s>
<s> 

yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him </s>
<s>   find him
find him out thats all </s>
<s>   i shall know what to do next </s>
<s>  never fear </s>
<s> 

the boy murmured a reply of intelligence </s>
<s>   and hurried downstairs after
his companions </s>
<s> 

he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation </s>
<s> 
if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his mouth
yet </s>

chapter xiv

comprising further particulars of olivers stay at <abvr> brownlows with
the remarkable prediction which one <abvr> grimwig uttered concerning him
when he went out on an errand

oliver soon recovering from the faintingfit into which <abvr> brownlows
abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was
carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and <abvr> bedwin in the
conversation that ensued </s>
<s>   which indeed bore no reference to olivers
history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse
without exciting him </s>
<s>   he was still too weak to get up to breakfast </s>
<s> 
but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first
act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again
looking on the face of the beautiful lady </s>
<s>   his expectations were
disappointed however for the picture had been removed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes </s>
<s> 
it is gone you see </s>
<s> 

i see it is maam replied oliver </s>
<s>   why have they taken it away </s>
<s> 

it has been taken down child because <abvr> brownlow said that as it
seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you
know rejoined the old lady </s>
<s> 

oh no indeed </s>
<s>   it didnt worry me maam said oliver </s>
<s>  i liked to
see it </s>
<s>   i quite loved it </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said the old lady goodhumouredly </s>
<s>  you get well as fast
as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>   i promise
you that </s>
<s>   now let us talk about something else </s>
<s> 

this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at
that time </s>
<s>   as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he
endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then </s>
<s>  so he listened
attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and
handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome
man and lived in the country </s>
<s>  and about a son who was clerk to a
merchant in the west indies </s>
<s>  and who was also such a good young man
and wrote such dutiful letters home four times ayear that it brought
the tears into her eyes to talk about them </s>
<s>   when the old lady had
expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children and the
merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone
poor dear soul </s>
<s>  just sixandtwenty years it was time to have tea </s>
<s> 
after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage </s>
<s>  which he learnt as
quickly as she could teach </s>
<s>   and at which game they played with great
interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some
warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and then to go cosily
to bed </s>
<s> 

they were happy days those of olivers recovery </s>
<s>   everything was so
quiet and neat and orderly </s>
<s>  everybody so kind and gentle </s>
<s>  that after
the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it
seemed like heaven itself </s>
<s>   he was no sooner strong enough to put his
clothes on properly than <abvr> brownlow caused a complete new suit and
a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him </s>
<s>   as oliver
was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave
them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell
them to a jew and keep the money for herself </s>
<s>   this she very readily
did </s>
<s>  and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew
roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think
that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger
of his ever being able to wear them again </s>
<s>   they were sad rags to tell
the truth </s>
<s>  and oliver had never had a new suit before </s>
<s> 

one evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was
sitting talking to <abvr> bedwin there came a message down from <abvr>
brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see
him in his study and talk to him a little while </s>
<s> 

bless us and save us </s>
<s>   wash your hands and let me part your hair
nicely for you child said <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   dear heart alive </s>
<s>   if we
had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean
collar on and made you as smart as sixpence </s>
<s> 

oliver did as the old lady bade him </s>
<s>  and although she lamented
grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little
frill that bordered his shirtcollar </s>
<s>  he looked so delicate and
handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so
far as to say </s>
<s>   looking at him with great complacency from head to
foot that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the
longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better </s>
<s> 

thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door </s>
<s>   on <abvr> brownlow
calling to him to come in he found himself in a little back room
quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little
gardens </s>
<s>   there was a table drawn up before the window at which <abvr>
brownlow was seated reading </s>
<s>   when he saw oliver he pushed the book
away from him and told him to come near the table and sit down </s>
<s> 
oliver complied </s>
<s>  marvelling where the people could be found to read
such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
wiser </s>
<s>   which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver
twist every day of their lives </s>
<s> 

there are a good many books are there not my boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the
shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling </s>
<s> 

a great number sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   i never saw so many </s>
<s> 

you shall read them if you behave well said the old gentleman
kindly </s>
<s>  and you will like that better than looking at the
outsidesthat is some cases </s>
<s>  because there are books of which the
backs and covers are by far the best parts </s>
<s> 

i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to
some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding </s>
<s> 

not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head
and smiling as he did so </s>
<s>  there are other equally heavy ones though
of a much smaller size </s>
<s>   how should you like to grow up a clever man
and write books eh </s>
<s> 

i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  wouldnt you like to be a bookwriter </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

oliver considered a little while </s>
<s>  and at last said he should think it
would be a much better thing to be a bookseller </s>
<s>  upon which the old
gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing </s>
<s> 
which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it
was </s>
<s> 

well well said the old gentleman composing his features </s>
<s>  dont be
afraid </s>
<s>   we wont make an author of you while theres an honest trade
to be learnt or brickmaking to turn to </s>
<s> 

thank you sir said oliver </s>
<s>   at the earnest manner of his reply the
old gentleman laughed again </s>
<s>  and said something about a curious
instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention
to </s>
<s> 

now said <abvr> brownlow speaking if possible in a kinder but at the
same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever known him
assume yet i want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am
going to say </s>
<s>   i shall talk to you without any reserve </s>
<s>  because i am
sure you are well able to understand me as many older persons would
be </s>
<s> 

oh dont tell you are going to send me away sir pray </s>
<s>  exclaimed
oliver alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentlemans
commencement </s>
<s>   dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
again </s>
<s>   let me stay here and be a servant </s>
<s>   dont send me back to the
wretched place i came from </s>
<s>   have mercy upon a poor boy sir </s>
<s> 

my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of
olivers sudden appeal </s>
<s>  you need not be afraid of my deserting you
unless you give me cause </s>
<s> 

i never never will sir interposed oliver </s>
<s> 

i hope not rejoined the old gentleman </s>
<s>   i do not think you ever
will </s>
<s>   i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have
endeavoured to benefit </s>
<s>  but i feel strongly disposed to trust you
nevertheless </s>
<s>  and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well
account for even to myself </s>
<s>   the persons on whom i have bestowed my
dearest love lie deep in their graves </s>
<s>  but although the happiness and
delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my
heart and sealed it up forever on my best affections </s>
<s>   deep
affliction has but strengthened and refined them </s>
<s> 

as the old gentleman said this in a low voice </s>
<s>   more to himself than to
his companion </s>
<s>   and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards </s>
<s> 
oliver sat quite still </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful
tone i only say this because you have a young heart </s>
<s>  and knowing
that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful
perhaps not to wound me again </s>
<s>   you say you are an orphan without a
friend in the world </s>
<s>  all the inquiries i have been able to make
confirm the statement </s>
<s>   let me hear your story </s>
<s>  where you come from </s>
<s> 
who brought you up </s>
<s>  and how you got into the company in which i found
you </s>
<s>   speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live </s>
<s> 

olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes </s>
<s>  when he was on
the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the
farm and carried to the workhouse by <abvr> bumble a peculiarly
impatient little doubleknock was heard at the streetdoor </s>
<s>   and the
servant running upstairs announced <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

is he coming up </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied the servant </s>
<s>   he asked if there were any muffins
in the house </s>
<s>  and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow smiled </s>
<s>  and turning to oliver said that <abvr> grimwig was
an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in
his manners </s>
<s>  for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason
to know </s>
<s> 

shall i go downstairs sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

no replied <abvr> brownlow i would rather you remained here </s>
<s> 

at this moment there walked into the room </s>
<s>   supporting himself by a
thick stick </s>
<s>   a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was
dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and
gaiters and a broadbrimmed white hat with the sides turned up with
green </s>
<s>   a very smallplaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat </s>
<s> 
and a very long steel watchchain with nothing but a key at the end
dangled loosely below it </s>
<s>   the ends of his white neckerchief were
twisted into a ball about the size of an orange </s>
<s>  the variety of shapes
into which his countenance was twisted defy description </s>
<s>   he had a
manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke </s>
<s>  and of looking
out of the corners of his eyes at the same time </s>
<s>   which irresistibly
reminded the beholder of a parrot </s>
<s>   in this attitude he fixed himself
the moment he made his appearance </s>
<s>  and holding out a small piece of
orangepeel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented
voice </s>
<s> 

look here </s>
<s>  do you see this </s>
<s>   isnt it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that i cant call at a mans house but i find a
piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase </s>
<s>  ive been lamed
with orangepeel once and i know orangepeel will be my death or ill
be content to eat my own head sir </s>
<s> 

this was the handsome offer with which <abvr> grimwig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he made </s>
<s>  and it was the more singular in his
case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility
of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed
mr </s>
<s>  grimwigs head was such a particularly large one that the most
sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question a very
thick coating of powder </s>
<s> 

ill eat my head sir repeated <abvr> grimwig striking his stick upon
the ground </s>
<s>   hallo </s>
<s>  whats that </s>
<s>  looking at oliver and retreating a
pace or two </s>
<s> 

this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said <abvr>
brownlow </s>
<s> 

oliver bowed </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to say thats the boy who had the fever i hope </s>
<s>  said
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig recoiling a little more </s>
<s>   wait a minute </s>
<s>  dont speak </s>
<s> 
stop continued <abvr> grimwig abruptly losing all dread of the fever
in his triumph at the discovery </s>
<s>  thats the boy who had the orange </s>
<s> 
if thats not the boy sir who had the orange and threw this bit of
peel upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too </s>
<s> 

no no he has not had one said <abvr> brownlow laughing </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>   put
down your hat </s>
<s>  and speak to my young friend </s>
<s> 

i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old
gentleman drawing off his gloves </s>
<s>   theres always more or less
orangepeel on the pavement in our street </s>
<s>  and i know its put there
by the surgeons boy at the corner </s>
<s>   a young woman stumbled over a bit
last night and fell against my gardenrailings </s>
<s>  directly she got up i
saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomimelight </s>
<s> 
dont go to him i called out of the window hes an assassin </s>
<s>   a
mantrap </s>
<s>   so he is </s>
<s>   if he is not  here the irascible old
gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick </s>
<s>  which was
always understood by his friends to imply the customary offer
whenever it was not expressed in words </s>
<s>  then still keeping his stick
in his hand he sat down </s>
<s>  and opening a double eyeglass which he
wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of oliver </s>
<s>   who
seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again </s>
<s> 

thats the boy is it </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig at length </s>
<s> 

thats the boy replied <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

how are you boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

a great deal better thank you sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about
to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step downstairs and tell
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin they were ready for tea </s>
<s>  which as he did not half like the
visitors manner he was very happy to do </s>
<s> 

he is a nicelooking boy is he not </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

i dont know replied <abvr> grimwig pettishly </s>
<s> 

dont know </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   i dont know </s>
<s>   i never see any difference in boys </s>
<s>   i only knew
two sort of boys </s>
<s>   mealy boys and beeffaced boys </s>
<s> 

and which is oliver </s>
<s> 

mealy </s>
<s>   i know a friend who has a beeffaced boy </s>
<s>  a fine boy they
call him </s>
<s>  with a round head and red cheeks and glaring eyes </s>
<s>  a horrid
boy </s>
<s>  with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams
of his blue clothes </s>
<s>  with the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a
wolf </s>
<s>   i know him </s>
<s>   the wretch </s>
<s> 

come said <abvr> brownlow these are not the characteristics of young
oliver twist </s>
<s>  so he neednt excite your wrath </s>
<s> 

they are not replied <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   he may have worse </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> brownlow coughed impatiently </s>
<s>  which appeared to afford <abvr>
grimwig the most exquisite delight </s>
<s> 

he may have worse i say repeated <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   where does he come
from </s>
<s>   who is he </s>
<s>   what is he </s>
<s>   he has had a fever </s>
<s>   what of that </s>
<s> 
fevers are not peculiar to good people </s>
<s>  are they </s>
<s>   bad people have
fevers sometimes </s>
<s>  havent they eh </s>
<s>   i knew a man who was hung in
jamaica for murdering his master </s>
<s>   he had had a fever six times </s>
<s>  he
wasnt recommended to mercy on that account </s>
<s>   pooh </s>
<s>  nonsense </s>
<s> 

now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own heart <abvr>
grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and
manner were unusually prepossessing </s>
<s>  but he had a strong appetite for
contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
orangepeel </s>
<s>  and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to
him whether a boy was welllooking or not he had resolved from the
first to oppose his friend </s>
<s>   when <abvr> brownlow admitted that on no one
point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer </s>
<s>  and that he
had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he
thought the boy was strong enough to hear it </s>
<s>  <abvr> grimwig chuckled
maliciously </s>
<s>   and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper
was in the habit of counting the plate at night </s>
<s>  because if she didnt
find a tablespoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would
be content toand so forth </s>
<s> 

all this <abvr> brownlow although himself somewhat of an impetuous
gentleman </s>
<s>   knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good
humour </s>
<s>  as <abvr> grimwig at tea was graciously pleased to express his
entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly </s>
<s>  and
oliver who made one of the party began to feel more at his ease than
he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence </s>
<s> 

and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of
the life and adventures of oliver twist </s>
<s>  asked grimwig of <abvr>
brownlow at the conclusion of the meal </s>
<s>  looking sideways at oliver as
he resumed his subject </s>
<s> 

tomorrow morning replied <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   i would rather he was
alone with me at the time </s>
<s>   come up to me tomorrow morning at ten
oclock my dear </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   he answered with some hesitation because
he was confused by <abvr> grimwigs looking so hard at him </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  he
wont come up to you tomorrow morning </s>
<s>   i saw him hesitate </s>
<s>  he is
deceiving you my good friend </s>
<s> 

ill swear he is not replied <abvr> brownlow warmly </s>
<s> 

if he is not said <abvr> grimwig ill and down went the stick </s>
<s> 

ill answer for that boys truth with my life </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow
knocking the table </s>
<s> 

and i for his falsehood with my head </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> grimwig knocking
the table also </s>
<s> 

we shall see said <abvr> brownlow checking his rising anger </s>
<s> 

we will replied <abvr> grimwig with a provoking smile </s>
<s>   we will </s>
<s> 

as fate would have it <abvr> bedwin chanced to bring in at this moment
a small parcel of books which <abvr> brownlow had that morning purchased
of the identical bookstallkeeper who has already figured in this
history </s>
<s>  having laid them on the table she prepared to leave the room </s>
<s> 

stop the boy <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  there is something to
go back </s>
<s> 

he has gone sir replied <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s> 

call after him said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  its particular </s>
<s>   he is a poor
man and they are not paid for </s>
<s>   there are some books to be taken back
too </s>
<s> 

the streetdoor was opened </s>
<s>   oliver ran one way </s>
<s>  and the girl ran
another </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy </s>
<s> 
but there was no boy in sight </s>
<s>   oliver and the girl returned in a
breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him </s>
<s> 

dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  i
particularly wished those books to be returned tonight </s>
<s> 

send oliver with them said <abvr> grimwig with an ironical smile </s>
<s>  he
will be sure to deliver them safely you know </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  do let me take them if you please sir said oliver </s>
<s>  ill run
all the way sir </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out
on any account </s>
<s>  when a most malicious cough from <abvr> grimwig determined
him that he should </s>
<s>  and that by his prompt discharge of the
commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions </s>
<s>   on
this head at least </s>
<s>   at once </s>
<s> 

you shall go my dear said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   the books are on a
chair by my table </s>
<s>   fetch them down </s>
<s> 

oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his arm in
a great bustle </s>
<s>  and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to
take </s>
<s> 

you are to say said <abvr> brownlow glancing steadily at grimwig </s>
<s>  you
are to say that you have brought those books back </s>
<s>  and that you have
come to pay the four pound ten i owe him </s>
<s>   this is a fivepound note
so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change </s>
<s> 

i wont be ten minutes sir said oliver eagerly </s>
<s>   having buttoned
up the banknote in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully
under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room </s>
<s>   <abvr>
bedwin followed him to the streetdoor giving him many directions
about the nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of
the street </s>
<s>   all of which oliver said he clearly understood </s>
<s>   having
superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old lady
at length permitted him to depart </s>
<s> 

bless his sweet face </s>
<s>  said the old lady looking after him </s>
<s>  i cant
bear somehow to let him go out of my sight </s>
<s> 

at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned
the corner </s>
<s>   the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and
closing the door went back to her own room </s>
<s> 

let me see </s>
<s>  hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said <abvr>
brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table </s>
<s>   it will
be dark by that time </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you really expect him to come back do you </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

dont you </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> brownlow smiling </s>
<s> 

the spirit of contradiction was strong in <abvr> grimwigs breast at the
moment </s>
<s>  and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile </s>
<s> 

no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not </s>
<s>  the boy has
a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his
arm and a fivepound note in his pocket </s>
<s>   hell join his old friends
the thieves and laugh at you </s>
<s>   if ever that boy returns to this house
sir ill eat my head </s>
<s> 

with these words he drew his chair closer to the table </s>
<s>  and there the
two friends sat in silent expectation with the watch between them </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our
own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
hasty conclusions that although <abvr> grimwig was not by any means a
badhearted man and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly
and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come back </s>
<s> 

it grew so dark that the figures on the dialplate were scarcely
discernible </s>
<s>  but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in
silence with the watch between them </s>

chapter xv

showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy
were

in the obscure parlour of a low publichouse in the filthiest part of
little saffron hill </s>
<s>  a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight
burnt all day in the wintertime </s>
<s>  and where no ray of sun ever shone in
the summer </s>
<s>   there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a
small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a man in a
velveteen coat drab shorts halfboots and stockings whom even by
that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated
to recognise as <abvr> william sikes </s>
<s>   at his feet sat a whitecoated
redeyed dog </s>
<s>  who occupied himself alternately in winking at his
master with both eyes at the same time </s>
<s>  and in licking a large fresh
cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some
recent conflict </s>
<s> 

keep quiet you warmint </s>
<s>   keep quiet </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes suddenly
breaking silence </s>
<s>   whether his meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought
upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable
from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is matter for
argument and consideration </s>
<s>   whatever was the cause the effect was a
kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously </s>
<s> 

dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
their masters </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sikess dog having faults of temper in common
with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a
powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth
in one of the halfboots </s>
<s>   having given in a hearty shake he retired
growling under a form </s>
<s>  just escaping the pewter measure which <abvr>
sikes levelled at his head </s>
<s> 

you would would you </s>
<s>  said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and
deliberately opening with the other a large claspknife which he drew
from his pocket </s>
<s>   come here you born devil </s>
<s>   come here </s>
<s>   dye hear </s>
<s> 

the dog no doubt heard </s>
<s>  because <abvr> sikes spoke in the very harshest
key of a very harsh voice </s>
<s>  but appearing to entertain some
unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he
was and growled more fiercely than before </s>
<s>   at the same time grasping
the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild
beast </s>
<s> 

this resistance only infuriated <abvr> sikes the more </s>
<s>  who dropping on
his knees began to assail the animal most furiously </s>
<s>   the dog jumped
from right to left and from left to right </s>
<s>  snapping growling and
barking </s>
<s>  the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed </s>
<s>  and the
struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other </s>
<s>  when the
door suddenly opening the dog darted out </s>
<s>   leaving bill sikes with the
poker and the claspknife in his hands </s>
<s> 

there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sikes being disappointed of the dogs participation at once
transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer </s>
<s> 

what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for </s>
<s>  said sikes
with a fierce gesture </s>
<s> 

i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humbly </s>
<s>  for the
jew was the new comer </s>
<s> 

didnt know you whitelivered thief </s>
<s>  growled sikes </s>
<s>  couldnt you
hear the noise </s>
<s> 

not a sound of it as im a living man bill replied the jew </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>   you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce
sneer </s>
<s>   sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go </s>
<s>   i
wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with a forced smile </s>
<s> 

cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as
havent half the pluck of curs lets a man kill a dog how he likes
replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look </s>
<s> 
thats why </s>
<s> 

the jew rubbed his hands </s>
<s>  and sitting down at the table affected to
laugh at the pleasantry of his friend </s>
<s>   he was obviously very ill at
ease however </s>
<s> 

grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with
savage contempt </s>
<s>  grin away </s>
<s>   youll never have the laugh at me
though unless its behind a nightcap </s>
<s>   ive got the upper hand over
you fagin </s>
<s>  and dme ill keep it </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>   if i go you go </s>
<s>  so take
care of me </s>
<s> 

well well my dear said the jew i know all that </s>
<s>  wewehave a
mutual interest billa mutual interest </s>
<s> 

humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
the jews side than on his </s>
<s>   well what have you got to say to me </s>
<s> 

its all passed safe through the meltingpot replied fagin and
this is your share </s>
<s>   its rather more than it ought to be my dear </s>
<s>  but
as i know youll do me a good turn another time and

stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently </s>
<s>  where is it </s>
<s> 
hand over </s>
<s> 

yes yes bill </s>
<s>  give me time give me time replied the jew
soothingly </s>
<s>   here it is </s>
<s>   all safe </s>
<s>   as he spoke he drew forth an
old cotton handkerchief from his breast </s>
<s>  and untying a large knot in
one corner produced a small brownpaper packet </s>
<s>   sikes snatching it
from him hastily opened it </s>
<s>  and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
contained </s>
<s> 

this is all is it </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

all replied the jew </s>
<s> 

you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along have you </s>
<s>  inquired sikes suspiciously </s>
<s>  dont put on an
injured look at the question </s>
<s>  youve done it many a time </s>
<s>  jerk the
tinkler </s>
<s> 

these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell </s>
<s> 
it was answered by another jew </s>
<s>   younger than fagin but nearly as vile
and repulsive in appearance </s>
<s> 

bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure </s>
<s>   the jew perfectly
understanding the hint retired to fill it </s>
<s>   previously exchanging a
remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if
in expectation of it and shook his head in reply </s>
<s>  so slightly that the
action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
person </s>
<s>   it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie
the bootlace which the dog had torn </s>
<s>   possibly if he had observed the
brief interchange of signals he might have thought that it boded no
good to him </s>
<s> 

is anybody here barney </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s>  speaking now that that
sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground </s>
<s> 

dot a shoul replied barney </s>
<s>  whose words </s>
<s>   whether they came from the
heart or not </s>
<s>   made their way through the nose </s>
<s> 

nobody </s>
<s>  inquired fagin in a tone of surprise </s>
<s>   which perhaps might
mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth </s>
<s> 

dobody but biss dadsy replied barney </s>
<s> 

nancy </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes </s>
<s>   where </s>
<s>   strike me blind if i dont honour
that ere girl for her native talents </s>
<s> 

shes bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney </s>
<s> 

send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor </s>
<s>  send her
here </s>
<s> 

barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission </s>
<s>  the jew remaining
silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired </s>
<s>  and
presently returned ushering in nancy </s>
<s>  who was decorated with the
bonnet apron basket and streetdoor key complete </s>
<s> 

you are on the scent are you nancy </s>
<s>  inquired sikes proffering the
glass </s>
<s> 

yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents </s>
<s> 
and tired enough of it i am too </s>
<s>   the young brats been ill and
confined to the crib </s>
<s>  and

ah nancy dear </s>
<s>  said fagin looking up </s>
<s> 

now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eyebrows and a
half closing of his deeplyset eyes warned miss nancy that she was
disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance </s>
<s> 
the fact is all we need care for here </s>
<s>  and the fact is that she
suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon <abvr>
sikes turned the conversation to other matters </s>
<s>  in about ten minutes
time <abvr> fagin was seized with a fit of coughing </s>
<s>  upon which nancy
pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself
expressed his intention of accompanying her </s>
<s>  they went away together
followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a backyard
as soon as his master was out of sight </s>
<s> 

the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it </s>
<s> 
looked after him as he walked up the dark passage </s>
<s>  shook his clenched
fist </s>
<s>  muttered a deep curse </s>
<s>  and then with a horrible grin reseated
himself at the table </s>
<s>  where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the hueandcry </s>
<s> 

meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very
short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the
bookstall </s>
<s>   when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a
bystreet which was not exactly in his way </s>
<s>  but not discovering his
mistake until he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in
the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back </s>
<s>  and
so marched on as quickly as he could with the books under his arm </s>
<s> 

he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to
feel </s>
<s>  and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick
who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment </s>
<s> 
when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud </s>
<s>   oh my
dear brother </s>
<s>   and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter
was when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round
his neck </s>
<s> 

dont cried oliver struggling </s>
<s>   let go of me </s>
<s>   who is it </s>
<s>  what are
you stopping me for </s>
<s> 

the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from
the young woman who had embraced him </s>
<s>  and who had a little basket and a
streetdoor key in her hand </s>
<s> 

oh my gracious </s>
<s>  said the young woman i have found him </s>
<s>   oh </s>

oliver </s>
<s>   oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your
account </s>
<s>   come home dear come </s>
<s>   oh ive found him </s>
<s>   thank gracious
goodness heavins ive found him </s>
<s>   with these incoherent exclamations
the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully
hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was
also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the
doctor </s>
<s>   to which the butchers boy </s>
<s>   who appeared of a lounging not
to say indolent disposition </s>
<s>   replied that he thought not </s>
<s> 

oh no no never mind said the young woman grasping olivers hand </s>
<s> 
im better now </s>
<s>   come home directly you cruel boy </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

oh maam replied the young woman he ran away near a month ago
from his parents who are hardworking and respectable people </s>
<s>  and went
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters </s>
<s>  and almost broke his
mothers heart </s>
<s> 

young wretch </s>
<s>  said one woman </s>
<s>

<s>  cried the young woman </s>
<s> 

why its nancy </s>
<s>  exclaimed oliver </s>
<s>  who now saw her face for the first
time </s>
<s>  and started back in irrepressible astonishment </s>
<s>

<s>  cried nancy appealing to the bystanders </s>
<s>  he
cant help himself </s>
<s>   make him come home theres good people or hell
kill his dear mother and father and break my heart </s>
<s> 

what the devils this </s>
<s>  said a man bursting out of a beershop with
a white dog at his heels </s>

i dont belong to them </s>

oliver struggling in the mans powerful grasp </s>

<s>  ill help you you young rascal </s>
<s> 

what books are these </s>
<s>   youve been a stealing em have you </s>

<s>   with these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp and
struck him on the head </s>
<s> 

thats right </s>

only way of bringing him to his senses </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  cried a sleepyfaced carpenter casting an approving look
at the garretwindow </s>
<s> 

itll do him good </s>
<s>  said the two women </s>
<s> 

and he shall have it too </s>
<s>  rejoined the man administering another
blow and seizing oliver by the collar </s>
<s>   come on you young villain </s>
<s> 
here bullseye mind him boy </s>
<s>   mind him </s>
<s> 

weak with recent illness </s>
<s>  stupified by the blows and the suddenness of
the attack </s>
<s>  terrified by the fierce growling of the dog and the
brutality of the man </s>
<s>  overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders
that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be </s>
<s> 
what could one poor child do </s>
<s>   darkness had set in </s>
<s>  it was a low
neighborhood </s>
<s>  no help was near </s>
<s>  resistance was useless </s>
<s>   in another
moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was
forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to
give utterance to unintelligible </s>
<s>   it was of little moment indeed
whether they were intelligible or no </s>
<s>  for there was nobody to care for
them had they been ever so plain </s>
<s> 


                              

the gaslamps were lighted </s>
<s>  <abvr> bedwin was waiting anxiously at the
open door </s>
<s>  the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if
there were any traces of oliver </s>
<s>  and still the two old gentlemen sat
perseveringly in the dark parlour with the watch between them </s>
<s> 



chapter xvi

relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy

the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open
space </s>
<s>  scattered about which were pens for beasts and other
indications of a cattlemarket </s>
<s>   sikes slackened his pace when they
reached this spot </s>
<s>   the girl being quite unable to support any longer
the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked </s>
<s>   turning to oliver
he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancys hand </s>
<s> 

do you hear </s>
<s>  growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round </s>
<s> 

they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers </s>
<s> 

oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail </s>
<s>   he
held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers </s>
<s> 

give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand </s>
<s> 
here bullseye </s>
<s> 

the dog looked up and growled </s>
<s> 

see here boy </s>
<s>  said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat </s>
<s> 
if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him </s>
<s>   dye mind </s>
<s> 

the dog growled again </s>
<s>  and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were
anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay </s>
<s> 

hes as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt </s>
<s>  said
sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval </s>
<s> 
now you know what youve got to expect master so call away as quick
as you like </s>
<s>  the dog will soon stop that game </s>
<s>   get on youngun </s>
<s> 

bullseye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
endearing form of speech </s>
<s>  and giving vent to another admonitory growl
for the benefit of oliver led the way onward </s>
<s> 

it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been
grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary </s>
<s>  the night
was dark and foggy </s>
<s>   the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle
through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the
streets and houses in gloom </s>
<s>  rendering the strange place still stranger
in olivers eyes </s>
<s>  and making his uncertainty the more dismal and
depressing </s>
<s> 

they had hurried on a few paces when a deep churchbell struck the
hour </s>
<s>   with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned
their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded </s>
<s> 

eight o clock bill said nancy when the bell ceased </s>
<s> 

whats the good of telling me that </s>
<s>  i can hear it cant i </s>
<s>  replied
sikes </s>
<s> 

i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy </s>
<s> 

of course they can replied sikes </s>
<s>   it was bartlemy time when i was
shopped </s>
<s>  and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt
hear the squeaking on </s>
<s>   arter i was locked up for the night the row
and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could
almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said nancy who still had her face turned towards the
quarter in which the bell had sounded </s>
<s>   oh bill such fine young
chaps as them </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  thats all you women think of answered sikes </s>
<s>   fine young
chaps </s>
<s>   well theyre as good as dead so it dont much matter </s>
<s> 

with this consolation <abvr> sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency
to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step
out again </s>
<s> 

wait a minute </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   i wouldnt hurry by if it was you
that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck
bill </s>
<s>   id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow
was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me </s>
<s> 

and what good would that do </s>
<s>  inquired the unsentimental <abvr> sikes </s>
<s> 
unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at
all for all the good it would do me </s>
<s>   come on and dont stand
preaching there </s>
<s> 

the girl burst into a laugh </s>
<s>  drew her shawl more closely round her </s>
<s>  and
they walked away </s>
<s>   but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in
her face as they passed a gaslamp saw that it had turned a deadly
white </s>
<s> 

they walked on by littlefrequented and dirty ways for a full
halfhour </s>
<s>   meeting very few people and those appearing from their
looks to hold much the same position in society as <abvr> sikes himself </s>
<s> 
at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of
oldclothes shops </s>
<s>  the dog running forward as if conscious that there
was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the
door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted </s>
<s>  the house was
in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed a board intimating
that it was to let </s>
<s>   which looked as if it had hung there for many
years </s>
<s> 

all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about </s>
<s> 

nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell </s>
<s> 
they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few
moments under a lamp </s>
<s>   a noise as if a sash window were gently raised
was heard </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards the door softly opened </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes then
seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony </s>
<s>  and
all three were quickly inside the house </s>
<s> 

the passage was perfectly dark </s>
<s>   they waited while the person who had
let them in chained and barred the door </s>
<s> 

anybody here </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

no replied a voice which oliver thought he had heard before </s>
<s> 

is the old un here </s>
<s>  asked the robber </s>
<s> 

yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been </s>
<s> 
wont he be glad to see you </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s> 

the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it
seemed familiar to olivers ears </s>
<s>   but it was impossible to distinguish
even the form of the speaker in the darkness </s>
<s> 

lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or
treading on the dog </s>
<s>   look after your legs if you do </s>
<s> 

stand still a moment and ill get you one replied the voice </s>
<s>  the
receding footsteps of the speaker were heard </s>
<s>  and in another minute
the form of <abvr> john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared </s>
<s> 
he bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
stick </s>
<s> 

the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin </s>
<s>  but turning away
beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs </s>
<s>  they
crossed an empty kitchen </s>
<s>  and opening the door of a low
earthysmelling room which seemed to have been built in a small
backyard were received with a shout of laughter </s>
<s> 

oh my wig my wig </s>
<s>  cried master charles bates from whose lungs the
laughter had proceeded </s>
<s>   here he is </s>
<s>  oh cry here he is </s>
<s>   oh fagin
look at him </s>
<s>   fagin do look at him </s>
<s>  i cant bear it </s>
<s>  it is such a
jolly game i cant bear it </s>
<s>   hold me somebody while i laugh it out </s>
<s> 

with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth master bates laid himself
flat on the floor </s>
<s>  and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an
ectasy of facetious joy </s>
<s>   then jumping to his feet he snatched the
cleft stick from the dodger </s>
<s>  and advancing to oliver viewed him round
and round </s>
<s>  while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number
of low bows to the bewildered boy </s>
<s>   the artful meantime who was of a
rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it
interfered with business rifled olivers pockets with steady assiduity </s>
<s> 

look at his togs fagin </s>
<s>  said charley putting the light so close to
his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire </s>
<s>   look at his togs </s>
<s> 
superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut </s>
<s>   oh my eye what a game </s>
<s> 
and his books too </s>
<s>   nothing but a gentleman fagin </s>
<s> 

delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing
with mock humility </s>
<s>   the artful shall give you another suit my dear
for fear you should spoil that sunday one </s>
<s>   why didnt you write my
dear and say you were coming </s>
<s>   wed have got something warm for
supper </s>
<s> 

at his master bates roared again </s>
<s>  so loud that fagin himself relaxed
and even the dodger smiled </s>
<s>  but as the artful drew forth the fivepound
note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
awakened his merriment </s>
<s> 

hallo whats that </s>
<s>  inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew
seized the note </s>
<s>   thats mine fagin </s>
<s> 

no no my dear said the jew </s>
<s>   mine bill mine </s>
<s>   you shall have
the books </s>
<s> 

if that aint mine </s>
<s>  said bill sikes putting on his hat with a
determined air </s>
<s>  mine and nancys that is </s>
<s>  ill take the boy back
again </s>
<s> 

the jew started </s>
<s>   oliver started too though from a very different
cause </s>
<s>  for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being
taken back </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>   hand over will you </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s> 

this is hardly fair bill </s>
<s>  hardly fair is it nancy </s>
<s>  inquired the
jew </s>
<s> 

fair or not fair retorted sikes hand over i tell you </s>
<s>  do you
think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time
but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as
gets grabbed through you </s>
<s>   give it here you avaricious old skeleton
give it here </s>
<s> 

with this gentle remonstrance <abvr> sikes plucked the note from between
the jews finger and thumb </s>
<s>  and looking the old man coolly in the face
folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief </s>
<s> 

thats for our share of the trouble said sikes </s>
<s>  and not half
enough neither </s>
<s>   you may keep the books if youre fond of reading </s>
<s> 
if you aint sell em </s>
<s> 

theyre very pretty said charley bates </s>
<s>  who with sundry grimaces
had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question </s>
<s>  beautiful
writing isnt is oliver </s>
<s>   at sight of the dismayed look with which
oliver regarded his tormentors master bates who was blessed with a
lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ectasy more
boisterous than the first </s>
<s> 

they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his hands </s>
<s> 
to the good kind old gentleman who took me into his house and had
me nursed when i was near dying of the fever </s>
<s>  oh pray send them back </s>
<s> 
send him back the books and money </s>
<s>   keep me here all my life long </s>
<s>  but
pray pray send them back </s>
<s>   hell think i stole them </s>
<s>  the old lady </s>
<s> 
all of them who were so kind to me </s>
<s>  will think i stole them </s>
<s>   oh do
have mercy upon me and send them back </s>
<s> 

with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet </s>
<s>  and beat his hands
together in perfect desperation </s>
<s> 

the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting
his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot </s>
<s>   youre right oliver youre
right </s>
<s>  they will think you have stolen em </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  chuckled the jew
rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen
our time </s>
<s> 

of course it couldnt replied sikes </s>
<s>  i knowd that directly i see
him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm </s>
<s>   its all
right enough </s>
<s>   theyre softhearted psalmsingers or they wouldnt
have taken him in at all </s>
<s>  and theyll ask no questions after him fear
they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged </s>
<s>   hes safe
enough </s>
<s> 

oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being
spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what
passed </s>
<s>  but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet
and tore wildly from the room </s>
<s>   uttering shrieks for help which made
the bare old house echo to the roof </s>
<s> 

keep back the dog bill </s>
<s>  cried nancy springing before the door and
closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit </s>
<s>   keep
back the dog </s>
<s>  hell tear the boy to pieces </s>
<s> 

serve him right </s>
<s>  cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from
the girls grasp </s>
<s>   stand off from me or ill split your head against
the wall </s>
<s> 

i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the
girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first </s>
<s> 

shant he </s>
<s>  said sikes setting his teeth </s>
<s>   ill soon do that if you
dont keep off </s>
<s> 

the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the
room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among
them </s>
<s> 

whats the matter here </s>
<s>  said fagin looking round </s>
<s> 

the girls gone mad i think replied sikes savagely </s>
<s> 

no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle </s>
<s> 
no she hasnt fagin </s>
<s>  dont think it </s>
<s> 

then keep quiet will you </s>
<s>  said the jew with a threatening look </s>
<s> 

no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud </s>
<s> 
come </s>
<s>   what do you think of that </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel
tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
conversation with her at present </s>
<s>   with the view of diverting the
attention of the company he turned to oliver </s>
<s> 

so you wanted to get away my dear did you </s>
<s>  said the jew taking up
a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

oliver made no reply </s>
<s>   but he watched the jews motions and breathed
quickly </s>
<s> 

wanted to get assistance </s>
<s>  called for the police </s>
<s>  did you </s>
<s>  sneered the
jew catching the boy by the arm </s>
<s>   well cure you of that my young
master </s>
<s> 

the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club </s>
<s>  and
was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it
from his hand </s>
<s>   she flung it into the fire with a force that brought
some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room </s>
<s> 

i wont stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl </s>
<s>  youve got
the boy and what more would you have </s>
<s> let him belet him beor i
shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows
before my time </s>
<s> 

the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this
threat </s>
<s>  and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked
alternately at the jew and the other robber </s>
<s>  her face quite colourless
from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself </s>
<s> 

why nancy </s>
<s>  said the jew in a soothing tone </s>
<s>  after a pause during
which he and <abvr> sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
manner </s>
<s>  youyoure more clever than ever tonight </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  my dear
you are acting beautifully </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   take care i dont overdo it </s>
<s>   you will be the
worse for it fagin if i do </s>
<s>  and so i tell you in good time to keep
clear of me </s>
<s> 

there is something about a roused woman </s>
<s>  especially if she add to all
her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and
despair </s>
<s>  which few men like to provoke </s>
<s>  the jew saw that it would be
hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss
nancys rage </s>
<s>  and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a
glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes </s>
<s>  as if to hint that
he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes thus mutely appealed to </s>
<s>  and possibly feeling his personal
pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy
to reason </s>
<s>  gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and
threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the
fertility of his invention </s>
<s>  as they produced no visible effect on the
object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more
tangible arguments </s>
<s> 

what do you mean by this </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>  backing the inquiry with a very
common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features </s>
<s> 
which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand
times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a
disorder as measles </s>
<s>  what do you mean by it </s>
<s>   burn my body </s>
<s>   do you
know who you are and what you are </s>
<s> 

oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing
hysterically </s>
<s>  and shaking her head from side to side with a poor
assumption of indifference </s>
<s> 

well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was
accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a
good long time to come </s>
<s> 

the girl laughed again </s>
<s>  even less composedly than before </s>
<s>  and darting
a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the
blood came </s>
<s> 

youre a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a
contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side </s>
<s>   a pretty
subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of </s>
<s> 

god almighty help me i am </s>
<s>  cried the girl passionately </s>
<s>  and i wish
i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them
we passed so near tonight before i had lent a hand in bringing him
here </s>
<s>   hes a thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night
forth </s>
<s>   isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows </s>
<s> 

come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory
tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all
that passed </s>
<s>  we must have civil words </s>
<s>  civil words bill </s>
<s> 

civil words </s>
<s>  cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see </s>
<s> 
civil words you villain </s>
<s>   yes you deserve em from me </s>
<s>  i thieved for
you when i was a child not half as old as this </s>
<s>  pointing to oliver </s>
<s> 
i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve
years since </s>
<s>   dont you know it </s>
<s>   speak out </s>
<s>   dont you know it </s>
<s> 

well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification </s>
<s>  and
if you have its your living </s>
<s> 

aye it is </s>
<s>  returned the girl </s>
<s>  not speaking but pouring out the
words in one continuous and vehement scream </s>
<s>   it is my living </s>
<s>  and the
cold wet dirty streets are my home </s>
<s>  and youre the wretch that drove
me to them long ago and thatll keep me there day and night day and
night till i die </s>
<s> 

i shall do you a mischief </s>
<s>  interposed the jew goaded by these
reproaches </s>
<s>  a mischief worse than that if you say much more </s>
<s> 

the girl said nothing more </s>
<s>  but tearing her hair and dress in a
transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably
have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been
seized by sikes at the right moment </s>
<s>  upon which she made a few
ineffectual struggles and fainted </s>
<s> 

shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner </s>
<s>  shes
uncommon strong in the arms when shes up in this way </s>
<s> 

the jew wiped his forehead </s>
<s>  and smiled as if it were a relief to have
the disturbance over </s>
<s>  but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the
boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
incidental to business </s>
<s> 

its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing
his club </s>
<s>  but theyre clever and we cant get on in our line
without em </s>
<s>   charley show oliver to bed </s>
<s> 

i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had
he </s>
<s>  inquired charley bates </s>
<s> 

certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which
charley put the question </s>
<s> 

master bates apparently much delighted with his commission took the
cleft stick </s>
<s>  and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were
two or three of the beds on which he had slept before </s>
<s>  and here with
many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old
suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon
leaving off at <abvr> brownlows </s>
<s>  and the accidental display of which to
fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue
received of his whereabout </s>
<s> 

put off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to
take care of </s>
<s>   what fun it is </s>
<s> 

poor oliver unwillingly complied </s>
<s>   master bates rolling up the new
clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the
dark and locking the door behind him </s>
<s> 

the noise of charleys laughter and the voice of miss betsy who
opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other
feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept
many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which
oliver was placed </s>
<s>   but he was sick and weary </s>
<s>  and he soon fell sound
asleep </s>

chapter xvii

olivers destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great man to london
to injure his reputation

mr </s>
<s>  bumble emerged at early morning from the workhousegate and walked
with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street </s>
<s>   he was
in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood </s>
<s>  his cocked hat and coat were
dazzling in the morning sun </s>
<s>  he clutched his cane with the vigorous
tenacity of health and power </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble always carried his head high </s>
<s> 
but this morning it was higher than usual </s>
<s>   there was an abstraction in
his eye an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for
utterance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and
others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along </s>
<s>   he merely
returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in
his dignified pace until he reached the farm where <abvr> mann tended
the infant paupers with parochial care </s>
<s> 

drat that beadle </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann hearing the wellknown shaking at
the gardengate </s>
<s>   if it isnt him at this time in the morning </s>
<s>   lauk
mr </s>
<s>  bumble only think of its being you </s>
<s>   well dear me it is a
pleasure this is </s>
<s>   come into the parlour sir please </s>
<s> 

the first sentence was addressed to susan </s>
<s>  and the exclamations of
delight were uttered to <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  as the good lady unlocked the
gardengate </s>
<s>  and showed him with great attention and respect into the
house </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  not sitting upon or dropping himself
into a seat as any common jackanapes would </s>
<s>  but letting himself
gradually and slowly down into a chair </s>
<s>  <abvr> mann maam good
morning </s>
<s> 

well and good morning to you sir replied <abvr> mann with many
smiles </s>
<s>  and hoping you find yourself well sir </s>
<s> 

soso <abvr> mann replied the beadle </s>
<s>   a porochial life is not a bed
of roses <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

ah that it isnt indeed <abvr> bumble rejoined the lady </s>
<s>  and all the
infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety
if they had heard it </s>
<s> 

a porochial life maam continued <abvr> bumble striking the table
with his cane is a life of worrit and vexation and hardihood </s>
<s>  but
all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her
hands with a look of sympathy and sighed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   you may well sigh <abvr> mann </s>
<s>  said the beadle </s>
<s> 

finding she had done right <abvr> mann sighed again </s>
<s>   evidently to the
satisfaction of the public character </s>
<s>   who repressing a complacent
smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat said

mrs </s>
<s>  mann i am going to london </s>
<s> 

lauk <abvr> bumble </s>

<s> 

to london maam resumed the inflexible beadle by coach </s>
<s>   i and
two paupers <abvr> mann </s>
<s>   a legal action is a coming on about a
settlement </s>
<s>  and the board has appointed meme <abvr> mannto dispose
to the matter before the quartersessions at clerkinwell </s>
<s> 

and i very much question added <abvr> bumble drawing himself up
whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
box before they have done with me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you mustnt be too hard upon them sir said <abvr> mann coaxingly </s>
<s> 

the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves maam
replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they
come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have
only themselves to thank </s>
<s> 

there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
manner in which <abvr> bumble delivered himself of these words that <abvr>
mann appeared quite awed by them </s>
<s>  at length she said

youre going by coach sir </s>
<s>   i thought it was always usual to send
them paupers in carts </s>
<s> 

thats when theyre ill <abvr> mann said the beadle </s>
<s>   we put the
sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their
taking cold </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

the opposition coach contracts for these two </s>
<s>  and takes them cheap
said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   they are both in a very low state and we find it
would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury emthat is if
we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to
do if they dont die upon the road to spite us </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

when <abvr> bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered
the cocked hat </s>
<s>  and he became grave </s>
<s> 

we are forgetting business maam said the beadle </s>
<s>  here is your
porochial stipend for the month </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his
pocketbook </s>
<s>  and requested a receipt </s>
<s>   which <abvr> mann wrote </s>
<s> 

its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants </s>
<s>  but its
formal enough i dare say </s>
<s>   thank you <abvr> bumble sir i am very much
obliged to you im sure </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of <abvr> manns curtsey </s>
<s> 
and inquired how the children were </s>
<s> 

bless their dear little hearts </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann with emotion theyre
as well as can be the dears </s>
<s>   of course except the two that died last
week </s>
<s>   and little dick </s>
<s> 

isnt that boy no better </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann shook her head </s>
<s> 

hes a illconditioned wicious baddisposed porochial child that
said <abvr> bumble angrily </s>
<s>   where is he </s>
<s> 

ill bring him to you in one minute sir replied <abvr> mann </s>
<s>  here
you dick </s>
<s> 

after some calling dick was discovered </s>
<s>   having had his face put under
the pump and dried upon <abvr> manns gown he was led into the awful
presence of <abvr> bumble the beadle </s>
<s> 

the child was pale and thin </s>
<s>  his cheeks were sunken </s>
<s>  and his eyes large
and bright </s>
<s>   the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung
loosely on his feeble body </s>
<s>  and his young limbs had wasted away like
those of an old man </s>
<s> 

such was the little being who stood trembling beneath <abvr> bumbles
glance </s>
<s>  not daring to lift his eyes from the floor </s>
<s>  and dreading even
to hear the beadles voice </s>
<s> 

cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

whats the matter with you porochial dick </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble with
welltimed jocularity </s>
<s> 

nothing sir replied the child faintly </s>
<s> 

i should think not said <abvr> mann who had of course laughed very
much at <abvr> bumbles humour </s>
<s> 

you want for nothing im sure </s>
<s> 

i should like faltered the child </s>
<s> 

heyday </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> mann i suppose youre going to say that you
do want for something now </s>
<s>   why you little wretch

stop <abvr> mann stop </s>
<s>  said the beadle raising his hand with a show
of authority </s>
<s>   like what sir eh </s>
<s> 

i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would
put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and
seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground </s>
<s> 

why what does the boy mean </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> bumble on whom the
earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression </s>
<s> 
accustomed as he was to such things </s>
<s>   what do you mean sir </s>
<s> 

i should like said the child to leave my dear love to poor oliver
twist </s>
<s>  and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to
think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help
him </s>
<s>   and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small
hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to
die when i was very young </s>
<s>  for perhaps if i had lived to be a man
and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me
or be unlike me </s>
<s>  and it would be so much happier if we were both
children there together </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with
indescribable astonishment </s>
<s>  and turning to his companion said
theyre all in one story <abvr> mann </s>
<s>   that outdacious oliver had
demogalized them all </s>
<s> 

i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands
and looking malignantly at dick </s>
<s>   i never see such a hardened little
wretch </s>
<s> 

take him away maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble imperiously </s>
<s>   this must be
stated to the board <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

i hope the gentleman will understand that it isnt my fault sir </s>
<s> 
said <abvr> mann whimpering pathetically </s>
<s> 

they shall understand that maam </s>
<s>  they shall be acquainted with the
true state of the case said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>  take him away i
cant bear the sight on him </s>
<s> 

dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coalcellar </s>
<s>   <abvr>
bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey </s>
<s> 

at six oclock next morning <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   having exchanged his cocked
hat for a round one and encased his person in a blue greatcoat with a
cape to it </s>
<s>   took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by
the criminals whose settlement was disputed </s>
<s>  with whom in due course
of time he arrived in london </s>
<s> 

he experienced no other crosses on the way than those which originated
in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in
shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which <abvr> bumble
declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel
quite uncomfortable </s>
<s>  although he had a greatcoat on </s>
<s> 

having disposed of these evilminded persons for the night <abvr> bumble
sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped </s>
<s>  and took a
temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter </s>
<s>  putting a glass
of hot ginandwater on the chimneypiece he drew his chair to the
fire </s>
<s>  and with sundry moral reflections on the tooprevalent sin of
discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper </s>
<s> 

the very first paragraph upon which <abvr> bumbles eye rested was the
following advertisement </s>
<s> 

                 five guineas reward

whereas a young boy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on
thursday evening last from his home at pentonville </s>
<s>  and has not since
been heard of </s>
<s>   the above reward will be paid to any person who will
give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver
twist or tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which
the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested </s>
<s> 

and then followed a full description of olivers dress person
appearance and disappearance </s>
<s>   with the name and address of <abvr>
brownlow at full length </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble opened his eyes </s>
<s>  read the advertisement slowly and
carefully three several times </s>
<s>  and in something more than five minutes
was on his way to pentonville </s>
<s>  having actually in his excitement left
the glass of hot ginandwater untasted </s>
<s> 

is <abvr> brownlow at home </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble of the girl who opened
the door </s>
<s> 

to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive
reply of i dont know </s>
<s>  where do you come from </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his
errand than <abvr> bedwin who had been listening at the parlour door
hastened into the passage in a breathless state </s>
<s> 

come in come in said the old lady </s>
<s>  i knew we should hear of him </s>
<s> 
poor dear </s>
<s>   i knew we should </s>
<s>   i was certain of it </s>
<s>   bless his heart </s>
<s> 
i said so all along </s>
<s> 

having heard this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
again </s>
<s>  and seating herself on a sofa burst into tears </s>
<s>  the girl who
was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile </s>
<s>  and now
returned with a request that <abvr> bumble would follow her immediately </s>
<s> 
which he did </s>
<s> 

he was shown into the little back study where sat <abvr> brownlow and his
friend <abvr> grimwig with decanters and glasses before them </s>
<s>   the latter
gentleman at once burst into the exclamation </s>
<s> 

a beadle </s>
<s>   a parish beadle or ill eat my head </s>
<s> 

pray dont interrupt just now said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   take a seat will
you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble sat himself down </s>
<s>  quite confounded by the oddity of <abvr>
grimwigs manner </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow moved the lamp so as to obtain an
uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance </s>
<s>  and said with a little
impatience

now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement </s>
<s> 

yes sir said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

and you are a beadle are you not </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

i am a porochial beadle gentlemen rejoined <abvr> bumble proudly </s>
<s> 

of course observed <abvr> grimwig aside to his friend i knew he was </s>
<s> 
a beadle all over </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and
resumed </s>
<s> 

do you know where this poor boy is now </s>
<s> 

no more than nobody replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

well what do you know of him </s>
<s>  inquired the old gentleman </s>
<s>  speak
out my friend if you have anything to say </s>
<s>   what do you know of him </s>
<s> 

you dont happen to know any good of him do you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig
caustically </s>
<s>  after an attentive perusal of <abvr> bumbles features </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his head with
portentous solemnity </s>
<s> 

you see </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig looking triumphantly at <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow looked apprehensively at <abvr> bumbles pursedup
countenance </s>
<s>  and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding
oliver in as few words as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble put down his hat </s>
<s>  unbuttoned his coat </s>
<s>  folded his arms </s>
<s> 
inclined his head in a retrospective manner </s>
<s>  and after a few moments
reflection commenced his story </s>
<s> 

it would be tedious if given in the beadles words </s>
<s>   occupying as it
did some twenty minutes in the telling </s>
<s>  but the sum and substance of
it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents </s>
<s> 
that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than
treachery ingratitude and malice </s>
<s>   that he had terminated his brief
career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly
attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the nighttime from
his masters house </s>
<s>   in proof of his really being the person he
represented himself <abvr> bumble laid upon the table the papers he had
brought to town </s>
<s>  folding his arms again he then awaited <abvr> brownlows
observations </s>
<s> 

i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after
looking over the papers </s>
<s>   this is not much for your intelligence </s>
<s>  but
i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been
favourable to the boy </s>
<s> 

it is not improbable that if <abvr> bumble had been possessed of this
information at an earlier period of the interview he might have
imparted a very different colouring to his little history </s>
<s>  it was too
late to do it now however </s>
<s>  so he shook his head gravely and
pocketing the five guineas withdrew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes </s>
<s>  evidently so
much disturbed by the beadles tale that even <abvr> grimwig forbore to
vex him further </s>
<s> 

at length he stopped and rang the bell violently </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin said <abvr> brownlow when the housekeeper appeared </s>
<s>  that
boy oliver is an imposter </s>
<s> 

it cant be sir </s>
<s>   it cannot be said the old lady energetically </s>
<s> 

i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman </s>
<s>   what do you mean by
cant be </s>
<s>   we have just heard a full account of him from his birth </s>
<s>  and
he has been a thoroughpaced little villain all his life </s>
<s> 

i never will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly </s>
<s>  never </s>
<s> 

you old women never believe anything but quackdoctors and lying
storybooks growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   i knew it all along </s>
<s>  why didnt
you take my advise in the beginning </s>
<s>  you would if he hadnt had a
fever i suppose eh </s>
<s>   he was interesting wasnt he </s>
<s>   interesting </s>
<s> 
bah </s>
<s>   and <abvr> grimwig poked the fire with a flourish </s>
<s> 

he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted <abvr> bedwin
indignantly </s>
<s>   i know what children are sir </s>
<s>  and have done these forty
years </s>
<s>  and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about
them </s>
<s>   thats my opinion </s>
<s> 

this was a hard hit at <abvr> grimwig who was a bachelor </s>
<s>   as it extorted
nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head
and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was
stopped by <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

silence </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from
feeling </s>
<s>   never let me hear the boys name again </s>
<s>   i rang to tell you
that </s>
<s>   never </s>
<s>   never on any pretence mind </s>
<s>   you may leave the room
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin </s>
<s>   remember </s>
<s>   i am in earnest </s>
<s> 

there were sad hearts at <abvr> brownlows that night </s>

olivers heart sank within him when he thought of his good friends </s>

was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it
might have broken outright </s>

chapter xviii

how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable
friends

about noon next day when the dodger and master bates had gone out to
pursue their customary avocations <abvr> fagin took the opportunity of
reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude </s>
<s>  of
which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary
extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious
friends </s>
<s>  and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so
much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery </s>
<s>  <abvr> fagin
laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and
cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished
with hunger </s>
<s>  and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young
lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel
circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing
a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be
hanged at the old bailey one morning </s>
<s>   <abvr> fagin did not seek to
conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his
eyes that the wrongheaded and treacherous behaviour of the young
person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the
victim of certain evidence for the crown </s>
<s>  which if it were not
precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him <abvr>
fagin and a few select friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> fagin concluded by drawing a
rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging </s>
<s>  and with
great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious
hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that
unpleasant operation </s>
<s> 

little olivers blood ran cold as he listened to the jews words and
imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them </s>
<s>   that it
was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the
guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already </s>
<s>  and
that deeplylaid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or
overcommunicative persons had been really devised and carried out by
the jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely
when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that
gentleman and <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  which seemed to bear reference to some
foregone conspiracy of the kind </s>
<s>   as he glanced timidly up and met the
jews searching look he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs
were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman </s>
<s> 

the jew smiling hideously patted oliver on the head and said that
if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they
would be very good friends yet </s>
<s>   then taking his hat and covering
himself with an old patched greatcoat he went out and locked the
roomdoor behind him </s>
<s> 

and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many
subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and
left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts </s>
<s>   which
never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must
long ago have formed of him were sad indeed </s>
<s> 

after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the roomdoor unlocked </s>
<s> 
and he was at liberty to wander about the house </s>
<s> 

it was a very dirty place </s>
<s>   the rooms upstairs had great high wooden
chimneypieces and large doors with panelled walls and cornices to the
ceiling </s>
<s>  which although they were black with neglect and dust were
ornamented in various ways </s>
<s>   from all of these tokens oliver concluded
that a long time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to
better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome </s>
<s>   dismal and
dreary as it looked now </s>
<s> 

spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings </s>
<s> 
and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would
scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes </s>
<s>   with
these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living
thing </s>
<s>  and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from
room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the
streetdoor to be as near living people as he could </s>
<s>  and would remain
there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys
returned </s>
<s> 

in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed </s>
<s>   the bars
which held them were screwed tight into the wood </s>
<s>  the only light which
was admitted stealing its way through round holes at the top </s>
<s>  which
made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows </s>
<s> 
there was a backgarret window with rusty bars outside which had no
shutter </s>
<s>  and out of this oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for
hours together </s>
<s>  but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused
and crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gableends </s>
<s> 
sometimes indeed a grizzly head might be seen peering over the
parapetwall of a distant house </s>
<s>  but it was quickly withdrawn again </s>
<s> 
and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed
with the rain and smoke of years it was as much as he could do to make
out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any
attempt to be seen or heardwhich he had as much chance of being as
if he had lived inside the ball of st </s>
<s>  pauls cathedral </s>
<s> 

one afternoon the dodger and master bates being engaged out that
evening the firstnamed young gentleman took it into his head to
evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person to do him
justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him </s>
<s>  and with
this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in
his toilet straightway </s>
<s> 

oliver was but too glad to make himself useful </s>
<s>  too happy to have some
faces however bad to look upon </s>
<s>  too desirous to conciliate those
about him when he could honestly do so </s>
<s>  to throw any objection in the
way of this proposal </s>
<s>   so he at once expressed his readiness </s>
<s>  and
kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the table so that he
could take his foot in his laps he applied himself to a process which
mr </s>
<s>  dawkins designated as japanning his trottercases </s>
<s>   the phrase
rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots </s>
<s> 

whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy
attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and
having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of
having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to
disturb his reflections </s>
<s>  or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco
that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer
that mollified his thoughts </s>
<s>  he was evidently tinctured for the nonce
with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature </s>
<s> 
he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief
space </s>
<s>  and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sign said
half in abstraction and half to master bates </s>
<s> 

what a pity it is he isnt a prig </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said master charles bates </s>
<s>  he dont know whats good for him </s>
<s> 

the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe </s>
<s>  as did charley bates </s>
<s> 
they both smoked for some seconds in silence </s>
<s> 

i suppose you dont even know what a prig is </s>
<s>  said the dodger
mournfully </s>
<s> 

i think i know that replied oliver looking up </s>
<s>   its a the </s>
<s> 
youre one are you not </s>
<s>  inquired oliver checking himself </s>
<s> 

i am replied the dodger </s>
<s>   id scorn to be anything else </s>
<s>   <abvr>
dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment
and looked at master bates as if to denote that he would feel obliged
by his saying anything to the contrary </s>
<s> 

i am repeated the dodger </s>
<s>   sos charley </s>
<s>   sos fagin </s>
<s>  sos sikes </s>
<s> 
sos nancy </s>
<s>   sos bet </s>
<s>   so we all are down to the dog </s>
<s>  and hes the
downiest one of the lot </s>
<s> 

and the least given to peaching added charley bates </s>
<s> 

he wouldnt so much as bark in a witnessbox for fear of committing
himself </s>
<s>  no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without
wittles for a fortnight said the dodger </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it observed charley </s>
<s> 

hes a rum dog </s>
<s>   dont he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs
or sings when hes in company </s>
<s>  pursued the dodger </s>
<s>  wont he growl at
all when he hears a fiddle playing </s>
<s>   and dont he hate other dogs as
aint of his breed </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s> 

hes an outandout christian said charley </s>
<s> 

this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it
was an appropriate remark in another sense if master bates had only
known it </s>
<s>  for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen claiming to
be outandout christians between whom and <abvr> sikes dog there
exist strong and singular points of resemblance </s>
<s> 

well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they
had strayed </s>
<s>  with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced
all his proceedings </s>
<s>   this hasnt go anything to do with young green
here </s>
<s> 

no more it has said charley </s>
<s>   why dont you put yourself under
fagin oliver </s>
<s> 

and make your fortun out of hand </s>
<s>  added the dodger with a grin </s>
<s> 

and so be able to retire on your property and do the genteel </s>
<s>  as i
mean to in the very next leapyear but four that ever comes and the
fortysecond tuesday in trinityweek said charley bates </s>
<s> 

i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly </s>
<s>  i wish they would let me
go </s>
<s>   iiwould rather go </s>
<s> 

and fagin would rather not </s>
<s>  rejoined charley </s>
<s> 

oliver knew this too well </s>
<s>  but thinking it might be dangerous to
express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his
bootcleaning </s>
<s> 

go </s>
<s>  exclaimed the dodger </s>
<s>   why wheres your spirit </s>
<s>  dont you take
any pride out of yourself </s>
<s>   would you go and be dependent on your
friends </s>
<s> 

oh blow that </s>
<s>  said master bates </s>
<s>  drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard
thats too mean </s>
<s>  that is </s>
<s> 

i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust </s>
<s> 

you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile </s>
<s> 
and let them be punished for what you did </s>
<s> 

that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out
of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work
together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our
lucky </s>
<s>  that was the move wasnt it charley </s>
<s> 

master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection
of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was
inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and
down into his throat </s>
<s>  and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping
about five minutes long </s>
<s> 

look here </s>
<s>  said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and
halfpence </s>
<s>  heres a jolly life </s>
<s>   whats the odds where it comes from </s>
<s> 
here catch hold </s>
<s>  theres plenty more where they were took from </s>
<s>   you
wont wont you </s>
<s>   oh you precious flat </s>
<s> 

its naughty aint it oliver </s>
<s>  inquired charley bates </s>
<s>  hell come
to be scragged wont he </s>
<s> 

i dont know what that means replied oliver </s>
<s> 

something in this way old feller said charly </s>
<s>   as he said it
master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief </s>
<s>  and holding it erect
in the air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious
sound through his teeth </s>
<s>  thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic
representation that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing </s>
<s> 

thats what it means said charley </s>
<s>   look how he stares jack </s>
<s> 

i never did see such prime company as that ere boy </s>
<s>  hell be the death
of me i know he will </s>
<s>   master charley bates having laughed heartily
again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes </s>
<s> 

youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with
much satisfaction when oliver had polished them </s>
<s>  fagin will make
something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that
turned out unprofitable </s>
<s>   youd better begin at once </s>
<s>  for youll come
to the trade long before you think of it </s>
<s>  and youre only losing time
oliver </s>
<s> 

master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his
own </s>
<s>   which being exhausted he and his friend <abvr> dawkins launched
into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the
life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the
best thing he could do would be to secure fagins favour without more
delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it </s>
<s> 

and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew
was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogels and
tickers

whats the good of talking in that way </s>
<s>  interposed master bates </s>
<s>  he
dont know what you mean </s>
<s> 

if you dont take pockethandkechers and watches said the dodger
reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some
other cove will </s>
<s>  so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse
and youll be all the worse too and nobody half a haporth the
better except the chaps wot gets themand youve just as good a right
to them as they have </s>
<s> 

to be sure to be sure </s>
<s>  said the jew who had entered unseen by
oliver </s>
<s>   it all lies in a nutshell my dear </s>
<s>  in a nutshell take the
dodgers word for it </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   he understands the catechism of his
trade </s>
<s> 

the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated the
dodgers reasoning in these terms </s>
<s>  and chuckled with delight at his
pupils proficiency </s>
<s> 

the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had
returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver
had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom
chitling </s>
<s>  and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
gallantries with the lady now made his appearance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  chitling was older in years than the dodger </s>
<s>  having perhaps
numbered eighteen winters </s>
<s>  but there was a degree of deference in his
deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that
he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius
and professional aquirements </s>
<s>   he had small twinkling eyes and a
pockmarked face </s>
<s>  wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy
fustian trousers and an apron </s>
<s>   his wardrobe was in truth rather out
of repair </s>
<s>  but he excused himself to the company by stating that his
time was only out an hour before </s>
<s>  and that in consequence of having
worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow
any attention on his private clothes </s>
<s>   <abvr> chitling added with strong
marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder
was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there
was no remedy against the county </s>
<s>   the same remark he considered to
apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair </s>
<s>  which he held to be
decidedly unlawful </s>
<s>   <abvr> chitling wound up his observations by stating
that he had not touched a drop of anything for fortytwo moral long
hardworking days </s>
<s>  and that he wished he might be busted if he warnt
as dry as a limebasket </s>
<s> 

where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver </s>
<s>  inquired the
jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the
table </s>
<s> 

iidont know sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

whos that </s>
<s>  inquired tom chitling casting a contemptuous look at
oliver </s>
<s> 

a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew </s>
<s> 

hes in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin </s>
<s> 
never mind where i came from young un </s>
<s>  youll find your way there
soon enough ill bet a crown </s>
<s> 

at this sally the boys laughed </s>
<s>   after some more jokes on the same
subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin </s>
<s>  and withdrew </s>
<s> 

after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew
their chairs towards the fire </s>
<s>  and the jew telling oliver to come and
sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to
interest his hearers </s>
<s>   these were the great advantages of the trade
the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the
liberality of the jew himself </s>
<s>   at length these subjects displayed
signs of being thoroughly exhausted </s>
<s>  and <abvr> chitling did the same </s>
<s> 
for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two </s>
<s> 
miss betsy accordingly withdrew </s>
<s>  and left the party to their repose </s>
<s> 

from this day oliver was seldom left alone </s>
<s>  but was placed in almost
constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with
the jew every day </s>
<s>  whether for their own improvement or olivers <abvr>
fagin best knew </s>
<s>   at other times the old man would tell them stories of
robberies he had committed in his younger days </s>
<s>   mixed up with so much
that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing
heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better
feelings </s>
<s> 

in short the wily old jew had the boy in his toils </s>
<s>   having prepared
his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the
companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place he was
now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would
blacken it and change its hue for ever </s>

chapter xix

in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on

it was a chill damp windy night when the jew </s>
<s>  buttoning his
greatcoat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up
over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face </s>
<s> 
emerged from his den </s>
<s>   he paused on the step as the door was locked and
chained behind him </s>
<s>  and having listened while the boys made all secure
and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down
the street as quickly as he could </s>
<s> 

the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of
whitechapel </s>
<s>   the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the
street </s>
<s>  and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck
off in the direction of the spitalfields </s>
<s> 

the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the
streets </s>
<s>  the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and
clammy to the touch </s>
<s>   it seemed just the night when it befitted such a
being as the jew to be abroad </s>
<s>   as he glided stealthily along creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old man
seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and
darkness through which he moved </s>
<s>  crawling forth by night in search of
some rich offal for a meal </s>
<s> 

he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he
reached bethnal green </s>
<s>  then turning suddenly off to the left he soon
became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
that close and denselypopulated quarter </s>
<s> 

the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be
at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the
intricacies of the way </s>
<s>   he hurried through several alleys and streets
and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the
farther end </s>
<s>   at the door of a house in this street he knocked </s>
<s>  having
exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it he walked
upstairs </s>
<s> 

a dog growled as he touched the handle of a roomdoor </s>
<s>  and a mans
voice demanded who was there </s>
<s> 

only me bill </s>
<s>  only me my dear said the jew looking in </s>
<s> 

bring in your body then said sikes </s>
<s>   lie down you stupid brute </s>
<s> 
dont you know the devil when hes got a greatcoat on </s>
<s> 

apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by <abvr> fagins outer
garment </s>
<s>  for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a
chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen </s>
<s>   wagging his
tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his
nature to be </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s> 

well my dear replied the jew </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  nancy </s>
<s> 

the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
imply a doubt of its reception </s>
<s>  for <abvr> fagin and his young friend had
not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver </s>
<s>   all doubts upon
the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys
behaviour </s>
<s>   she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair
and bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it </s>
<s>   for it was a
cold night and no mistake </s>
<s> 

it is cold nancy dear said the jew as he warmed his skinny hands
over the fire </s>
<s>   it seems to go right through one added the old man
touching his side </s>
<s> 

it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said
mr </s>
<s>  sikes </s>
<s>   give him something to drink nancy </s>
<s>   burn my body make
haste </s>
<s>   its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old carcase
shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave </s>
<s> 

nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were
many </s>
<s>   which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were
filled with several kinds of liquids </s>
<s>   sikes pouring out a glass of
brandy bade the jew drink it off </s>
<s> 

quite enough quite thankye bill replied the jew putting down the
glass after just setting his lips to it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>   youre afraid of our getting the better of you are you </s>
<s> 
inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew </s>
<s>   ugh </s>
<s> 

with a hoarse grunt of contempt <abvr> sikes seized the glass and threw
the remainder of its contents into the ashes </s>
<s>  as a preparatory ceremony
to filling it again for himself </s>
<s>   which he did at once </s>
<s> 

the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second
glassful </s>
<s>  not in curiousity for he had seen it often before </s>
<s>  but in a
restless and suspicious manner habitual to him </s>
<s>  it was a meanly
furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to
induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man </s>
<s>  and
with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a lifepreserver that
hung over the chimneypiece </s>
<s> 

there said sikes smacking his lips </s>
<s>  now im ready </s>
<s> 

for business </s>
<s>  inquired the jew </s>
<s> 

for business replied sikes </s>
<s>  so say what youve got to say </s>
<s> 

about the crib at chertsey bill </s>
<s>  said the jew drawing his chair
forward and speaking in a very low voice </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   wot about it </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you know what i mean my dear said the jew </s>
<s>   he knows what i
mean nancy </s>
<s>  dont he </s>
<s> 

no he dont sneered <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   or he wont and thats the same
thing </s>
<s>   speak out and call things by their right names </s>
<s>  dont sit
there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you
warnt the very first that thought about the robbery </s>
<s>   wot dye mean </s>
<s> 

hush bill hush </s>
<s>  said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop
this burst of indignation </s>
<s>  somebody will hear us my dear </s>
<s>  somebody
will hear us </s>
<s> 

let em hear </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>  i dont care </s>
<s>   but as <abvr> sikes did care
on reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew
calmer </s>
<s> 

there there said the jew coaxingly </s>
<s>   it was only my caution
nothing more </s>
<s>   now my dear about that crib at chertsey </s>
<s>  when is it to
be done bill eh </s>
<s>   when is it to be done </s>
<s>   such plate my dear such
plate </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in
a rapture of anticipation </s>
<s> 

not at all replied sikes coldly </s>
<s> 

not to be done at all </s>
<s>  echoed the jew leaning back in his chair </s>
<s> 

no not at all rejoined sikes </s>
<s>   at least it cant be a putup job
as we expected </s>
<s> 

then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale
with anger </s>
<s>   dont tell me </s>
<s> 

but i will tell you retorted sikes </s>
<s>   who are you thats not to be
told </s>
<s>   i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place
for a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants in line </s>
<s> 

do you mean to tell me bill said the jew </s>
<s>  softening as the other
grew heated </s>
<s>   that neither of the two men in the house can be got
over </s>
<s> 

yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes </s>
<s>   the old lady has had
em these twenty years </s>
<s>  and if you were to give em five hundred pound
they wouldnt be in it </s>
<s> 

but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the
women cant be got over </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied sikes </s>
<s> 

not by flash toby crackit </s>
<s>  said the jew incredulously </s>
<s>  think what
women are bill

no </s>
<s>  not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes </s>
<s>   he says hes
worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes
been loitering down there and its all of no use </s>
<s> 

he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my
dear said the jew </s>
<s> 

so he did rejoined sikes and they warnt of no more use than the
other plant </s>
<s> 

the jew looked blank at this information </s>
<s>   after ruminating for some
minutes with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his head and said
with a deep sigh that if flash toby crackit reported aright he feared
the game was up </s>
<s> 

and yet said the old man dropping his hands on his knees its a
sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it </s>
<s> 

so it is said <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   worse luck </s>
<s> 

a long silence ensued </s>
<s>  during which the jew was plunged in deep
thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy
perfectly demoniacal </s>
<s>   sikes eyed him furtively from time to time </s>
<s> 
nancy apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her
eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed </s>
<s> 

fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed </s>
<s> 
is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the outside </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself </s>
<s> 

is it a bargain </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

yes my dear yes rejoined the jew </s>
<s>  his eyes glistening and every
muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had
awakened </s>
<s> 

then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain
let it come off as soon as you like </s>
<s>   toby and me were over the
gardenwall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and
shutters </s>
<s>   the cribs barred up at night like a jail </s>
<s>  but theres one
part we can crack safe and softly </s>
<s> 

which is that bill </s>
<s>  asked the jew eagerly </s>
<s> 

why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn

yes </s>
<s>  said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost
starting out of it </s>
<s> 

umph </s>
<s>  cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her
head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews
face </s>
<s>   never mind which part it is </s>
<s>  you cant do it without me i
know </s>
<s>  but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you </s>
<s> 

as you like my dear as you like replied the jew </s>
<s>   is there no help
wanted but yours and tobys </s>
<s> 

none said sikes </s>
<s>   cept a centrebit and a boy </s>
<s>   the first weve
both got </s>
<s>  the second you must find us </s>
<s> 

a boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  then its a panel eh </s>
<s> 

never mind wot it is </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s>   i want a boy and he musnt be
a big un </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes reflectively if id only got that
young boy of ned the chimbleysweepers </s>
<s>   he kept him small on
purpose and let him out by the job </s>
<s>   but the father gets lagged </s>
<s>  and
then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from
a trade where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and
in time makes a prentice of him </s>
<s>   and so they go on said <abvr> sikes
his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on </s>
<s> 
and if theyd got money enough which its a providence they havent
we shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year
or two </s>
<s> 

no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering
during this speech and had only caught the last sentence </s>
<s>  bill </s>
<s> 

what now </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the
fire </s>
<s>  and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave
the room </s>
<s>   sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought
the precaution unnecessary </s>
<s>  but complied nevertheless by requesting
miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer </s>
<s> 

you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining
her seat very composedly </s>
<s> 

i tell you i do </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s> 

nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin </s>
<s>   i know what hes
going to say bill </s>
<s>  he neednt mind me </s>
<s> 

the jew still hesitated </s>
<s>   sikes looked from one to the other in some
surprise </s>
<s> 

why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin </s>
<s>  he asked at length </s>
<s> 
youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it </s>
<s>   she
aint one to blab </s>
<s>   are you nancy </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  replied the young lady </s>
<s>   drawing her chair up
to the table and putting her elbows upon it </s>
<s> 

no no my dear i know youre not said the jew </s>
<s>  but and again
the old man paused </s>
<s> 

but wot </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

i didnt know whether she mightnt praps be out of sorts you know
my dear as she was the other night replied the jew </s>
<s> 

at this confession miss nancy burst into a loud laugh </s>
<s>  and swallowing
a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst
into sundry exclamations of keep the game agoing </s>
<s>   never say die </s>
<s> 
and the like </s>
<s>   these seemed to have the effect of reassuring both
gentlemen </s>
<s>  for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and
resumed his seat </s>
<s>  as did <abvr> sikes likewise </s>
<s> 

now fagin said nancy with a laugh </s>
<s>   tell bill at once about
oliver </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  youre a clever one my dear </s>
<s>  the sharpest girl i ever saw </s>
<s>  said
the jew patting her on the neck </s>
<s>   it was about oliver i was going to
speak sure enough </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

what about him </s>
<s>  demanded sikes </s>
<s> 

hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper </s>
<s> 
laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully </s>
<s> 

he </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes </s>
<s> 

have him bill </s>
<s>  said nancy </s>
<s>   i would if i was in your place </s>
<s>  he
maynt be so much up as any of the others </s>
<s>  but thats not what you
want if hes only to open a door for you </s>
<s>   depend upon it hes a safe
one bill </s>
<s> 

i know he is rejoined fagin </s>
<s>   hes been in good training these last
few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread </s>
<s>   besides the
others are all too big </s>
<s> 

well he is just the size i want said <abvr> sikes ruminating </s>
<s> 

and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew </s>
<s> 
he cant help himself </s>
<s>   that is if you frighten him enough </s>
<s> 

frighten him </s>
<s>  echoed sikes </s>
<s>   itll be no sham frightening mind you </s>
<s> 
if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the work </s>
<s>  in
for a penny in for a pound </s>
<s>   you wont see him alive again fagin </s>
<s> 
think of that before you send him </s>
<s>   mark my words </s>
<s>  said the robber
poising a crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead </s>
<s> 

ive thought of it all said the jew with energy </s>
<s>  iveive had my
eye upon him my dears closeclose </s>
<s>  once let him feel that he is one
of us </s>
<s>  once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief </s>
<s>  and
hes ours </s>
<s>   ours for his life </s>
<s>   oho </s>
<s>   it couldnt have come about
better </s>
<s>   the old man crossed his arms upon his breast </s>
<s>  and drawing his
head and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy </s>
<s> 

ours </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>   yours you mean </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle </s>
<s>  mine if
you like bill </s>
<s> 

and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot
makes you take so much pains about one chalkfaced kid when you know
there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you
might pick and choose from </s>
<s> 

because theyre of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some
confusion not worth the taking </s>
<s>   their looks convict em when they
get into trouble and i lose em all </s>
<s>   with this boy properly managed
my dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them </s>
<s>   besides
said the jew recovering his selfpossession he has us now if he
could only give us legbail again </s>
<s>  and he must be in the same boat with
us </s>
<s>   never mind how he came there </s>
<s>  its quite enough for my power over
him that he was in a robbery </s>
<s>  thats all i want </s>
<s>   now how much better
this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the
waywhich would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides </s>
<s> 

when is it to be done </s>
<s>  asked nancy stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of <abvr> sikes expressive of the disgust with
which he received fagins affectation of humanity </s>
<s> 

ah to be sure said the jew </s>
<s>  when is it to be done bill </s>
<s> 

i planned with toby the night arter tomorrow rejoined sikes in a
surly voice if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy </s>
<s> 

good said the jew </s>
<s>  theres no moon </s>
<s> 

no rejoined sikes </s>
<s> 

its all arranged about bringing off the swag is it </s>
<s>  asked the jew </s>
<s> 

sikes nodded </s>
<s> 

and about

oh ah its all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him </s>
<s>  never
mind particulars </s>
<s>   youd better bring the boy here tomorrow night </s>
<s>   i
shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak </s>
<s>   then you hold your
tongue and keep the meltingpot ready and thats all youll have to
do </s>
<s> 

after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was
decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the
night had set in and bring oliver away with her </s>
<s>  fagin craftily
observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would
be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in
his behalf than anybody else </s>
<s>   it was also solemnly arranged that poor
oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be
unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of <abvr> william sikes </s>
<s> 
and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought
fit </s>
<s>  and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or
evil that might be necessary to visit him </s>
<s>  it being understood that to
render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by
mr </s>
<s>  sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and
corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash
toby crackit </s>
<s> 

these preliminaries adjusted <abvr> sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner </s>
<s> 
yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song
mingled with wild execrations </s>
<s>   at length in a fit of professional
enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools </s>
<s> 
which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of
explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it
contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he
fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell </s>
<s> 

goodnight nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before </s>
<s> 

goodnight </s>
<s> 

their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly </s>
<s>   there was no
flinching about the girl </s>
<s>   she was as true and earnest in the matter as
toby crackit himself could be </s>
<s> 

the jew again bade her goodnight and bestowing a sly kick upon the
prostrate form of <abvr> sikes while her back was turned groped
downstairs </s>
<s> 

always the way </s>
<s>  muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward </s>
<s> 
the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call
up some longforgotten feeling </s>

lasts </s>
<s>   ha </s>

<s>   the man against the child for a bag of gold </s>
<s> 

beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections <abvr> fagin wended
his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode </s>
<s>   where the dodger
was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return </s>
<s> 

is oliver abed </s>
<s>   i want to speak to him was his first remark as
they descended the stairs </s>
<s> 

hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door </s>
<s>   here he is </s>
<s> 

the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor </s>
<s>  so pale
with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he
looked like death </s>
<s>  not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in
the guise it wears when life has just departed </s>

spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the

chapter xx

wherein oliver is delivered over to <abvr> william sikes

when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find
that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at
his bedside </s>
<s>  and that his old shoes had been removed </s>
<s>  at first he was
pleased with the discovery </s>
<s>  hoping that it might be the forerunner of
his release </s>
<s>  but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting
down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and
manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the
residence of bill sikes that night </s>
<s> 

totostop there sir </s>
<s>  asked oliver anxiously </s>
<s> 

no no my dear </s>
<s>   not to stop there replied the jew </s>
<s>   we shouldnt
like to lose you </s>
<s>   dont be afraid oliver you shall come back to us
again </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear </s>
<s> 
oh no no </s>
<s> 

the old man who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread
looked round as he bantered oliver thus </s>
<s>  and chuckled as if to show
that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could </s>
<s> 

i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know
what youre going to bills foreh my dear </s>
<s> 

oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been
reading his thoughts </s>
<s>  but boldly said yes he did want to know </s>
<s> 

why do you think </s>
<s>  inquired fagin parrying the question </s>
<s> 

indeed i dont know sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

bah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from
a close perusal of the boys face </s>
<s>   wait till bill tells you then </s>
<s> 

the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject </s>
<s>  but the truth is that although oliver felt
very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
fagins looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries
just then </s>
<s>   he had no other opportunity </s>
<s>   for the jew remained very
surly and silent till night </s>
<s>   when he prepared to go abroad </s>
<s> 

you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table </s>
<s> 
and heres a book for you to read till they come to fetch you </s>
<s> 
goodnight </s>
<s> 

goodnight </s>
<s>  replied oliver softly </s>
<s> 

the jew walked to the door </s>
<s>  looking over his shoulder at the boy as he
went </s>
<s>   suddenly stopping he called him by his name </s>
<s> 

oliver looked up </s>
<s>  the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to
light it </s>
<s>   he did so </s>
<s>  and as he placed the candlestick upon the table
saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and
contracted brows from the dark end of the room </s>
<s> 

take heed oliver </s>
<s>  take heed </s>
<s>  said the old man shaking his right
hand before him in a warning manner </s>
<s>   hes a rough man and thinks
nothing of blood when his own is up </s>
<s>  whatever falls out say nothing </s>
<s> 
and do what he bids you </s>
<s>   mind </s>
<s>   placing a strong emphasis on the last
word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a
ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room </s>
<s> 

oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared and
pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard </s>
<s>   the
more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to
divine its real purpose and meaning </s>
<s> 

he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes
which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin </s>
<s> 
and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been
selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker
until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged </s>
<s>   he
was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where
he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely </s>
<s>   he remained
lost in thought for some minutes </s>
<s>  and then with a heavy sigh snuffed
the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him
began to read </s>
<s> 

he turned over the leaves </s>
<s>   carelessly at first </s>
<s>  but lighting on a
passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the
volume </s>
<s>   it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals </s>
<s> 
and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use </s>
<s>  here he read of
dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold </s>
<s>  of secret murders that
had been committed by the lonely wayside </s>
<s>  of bodies hidden from the eye
of man in deep pits and wells </s>
<s>  which would not keep them down deep as
they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so
maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had
confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony </s>
<s> 
here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night
had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad thoughts
to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs
quail to think of </s>
<s>   the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid
that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore </s>
<s>  and the words upon
them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow
murmurs by the spirits of the dead </s>
<s> 

in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him </s>
<s> 
then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such
deeds </s>
<s>  and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved
for crimes so fearful and appalling </s>
<s>  by degrees he grew more calm
and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from
his present dangers </s>
<s>  and that if any aid were to be raised up for a
poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it
might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in
the midst of wickedness and guilt </s>
<s> 

he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in
his hands when a rustling noise aroused him </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure
standing by the door </s>
<s>   whos there </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>   only me replied a tremulous voice </s>
<s> 

oliver raised the candle above his head </s>
<s>  and looked towards the door </s>
<s> 
it was nancy </s>
<s> 

put down the light said the girl turning away her head </s>
<s>  it hurts
my eyes </s>
<s> 

oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill </s>
<s> 
the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him </s>
<s>   and
wrung her hands </s>
<s>  but made no reply </s>
<s> 

god forgive me </s>
<s>  she cried after a while i never thought of this </s>
<s> 

has anything happened </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s>   can i help you </s>
<s>   i will if i
can </s>
<s>   i will indeed </s>
<s> 

she rocked herself to and fro </s>
<s>  caught her throat </s>
<s>  and uttering a
gurgling sound gasped for breath </s>
<s> 

nancy </s>
<s>  cried oliver what is it </s>
<s> 

the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground </s>
<s> 
and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her </s>
<s>  and shivered
with cold </s>
<s> 

oliver stirred the fire </s>
<s>   drawing her chair close to it she sat there
for a little time without speaking </s>
<s>  but at length she raised her head
and looked round </s>
<s> 

i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to
busy herself in arranging her dress </s>
<s>  its this damp dirty room i
think </s>
<s>   now nolly dear are you ready </s>
<s> 

am i to go with you </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   i have come from bill replied the girl </s>
<s>   you are to go with
me </s>
<s> 

what for </s>
<s>  asked oliver recoiling </s>
<s> 

what for </s>
<s>  echoed the girl raising her eyes and averting them again
the moment they encountered the boys face </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   for no harm </s>
<s> 

i dont believe it said oliver </s>
<s>   who had watched her closely </s>
<s> 

have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh </s>
<s>  for no
good then </s>
<s> 

oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better
feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion
for his helpless state </s>
<s>   but then the thought darted across his mind
that it was barely eleven oclock </s>
<s>  and that many people were still in
the streets </s>
<s>   of whom surely some might be found to give credence to
his tale </s>
<s>   as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward </s>
<s>   and
said somewhat hastily that he was ready </s>
<s> 

neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his
companion </s>
<s>   she eyed him narrowly while he spoke </s>
<s>  and cast upon him a
look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what
had been passing in his thoughts </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as
she looked cautiously round </s>
<s>   you cant help yourself </s>
<s>  i have tried
hard for you but all to no purpose </s>
<s>   you are hedged round and round </s>
<s> 
if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time </s>
<s> 

struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with
great surprise </s>
<s>   she seemed to speak the truth </s>
<s>  her countenance was
white and agitated </s>
<s>  and she trembled with very earnestness </s>
<s> 

i have saved you from being illused once and i will again and i do
now continued the girl aloud </s>
<s>  for those who would have fetched you
if i had not would have been far more rough than me </s>
<s>   i have promised
for your being quiet and silent </s>
<s>  if you are not you will only do harm
to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death </s>
<s>   see here </s>
<s>   i have
borne all this for you already as true as god sees me show it </s>
<s> 

she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and arms </s>
<s>  and
continued with great rapidity </s>
<s> 

remember this </s>
<s>   and dont let me suffer more for you just now </s>
<s>  if i
could help you i would </s>
<s>  but i have not the power </s>
<s>   they dont mean to
harm you </s>
<s>  whatever they make you do is no fault of yours </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 
every word from you is a blow for me </s>
<s>   give me your hand </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s> 
your hand </s>
<s> 

she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and
blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs </s>
<s>  the door was
opened quickly by some one shrouded in the darkness and was as
quickly closed when they had passed out </s>
<s>   a hackneycabriolet was in
waiting </s>
<s>  with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing
oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close </s>
<s> 
the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed
without the delay of an instant </s>
<s> 

the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued to pour into
his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted </s>
<s>   all was
so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he
was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the house to
which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening </s>
<s> 

for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty
street and a cry for help hung upon his lips </s>
<s>   but the girls voice
was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her
that he had not the heart to utter it </s>
<s>  while he hesitated the
opportunity was gone </s>
<s>  he was already in the house and the door was
shut </s>
<s> 

this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time </s>
<s> 
bill </s>
<s> 

hallo </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s>  appearing at the head of the stairs with a
candle </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   thats the time of day </s>
<s>   come on </s>
<s> 

this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty
welcome from a person of <abvr> sikes temperament </s>
<s>   nancy appearing
much gratified thereby saluted him cordially </s>
<s> 

bullseyes gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them
up </s>
<s>   hed have been in the way </s>
<s> 

thats right rejoined nancy </s>
<s> 

so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room </s>
<s> 
closing the door as he spoke </s>
<s> 

yes here he is replied nancy </s>
<s> 

did he come quiet </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

like a lamb rejoined nancy </s>
<s> 

im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver </s>
<s>  for the
sake of his young carcase </s>
<s>   as would otherways have suffered for it </s>
<s> 
come here young un </s>
<s>  and let me read you a lectur which is as well
got over at once </s>
<s> 

thus addressing his new pupil <abvr> sikes pulled off olivers cap and
threw it into a corner </s>
<s>  and then taking him by the shoulder sat
himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him </s>
<s> 

now first </s>
<s>   do you know wot this is </s>
<s>  inquired sikes taking up a
pocketpistol which lay on the table </s>
<s> 

oliver replied in the affirmative </s>
<s> 

well then look here continued sikes </s>
<s>   this is powder </s>
<s>  that eres
a bullet </s>
<s>  and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin </s>
<s> 

oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and
deliberation </s>
<s> 

now its loaded said <abvr> sikes when he had finished </s>
<s> 

yes i see it is sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

well said the robber grasping olivers wrist and putting the
barrel so close to his temple that they touched </s>
<s>  at which moment the
boy could not repress a start </s>
<s>  if you speak a word when youre out
odoors with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in
your head without notice </s>
<s>   so if you do make up your mind to speak
without leave say your prayers first </s>
<s> 

having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase
its effect <abvr> sikes continued </s>
<s> 

as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very
partickler arter you if you was disposed of </s>
<s>  so i neednt take this
devilandall of trouble to explain matters to you if it warnt for
your own good </s>
<s>   dye hear me </s>
<s> 

the short and the long of what you mean said nancy </s>
<s>   speaking very
emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his
serious attention to her words </s>
<s>   is that if youre crossed by him in
this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales
afterwards by shooting him through the head and will take your chance
of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way
of business every month of your life </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  observed <abvr> sikes approvingly </s>
<s>  women can always put
things in fewest words </s>
<s> except when its blowing up </s>
<s>  and then they
lengthens it out </s>
<s>   and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have
some supper and get a snooze before starting </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth </s>
<s> 
disappearing for a few minutes she presently returned with a pot of
porter and a dish of sheeps heads </s>
<s>  which gave occasion to several
pleasant witticisms on the part of <abvr> sikes founded upon the singular
coincidence of jemmies being a can name common to them and also to
an ingenious implement much used in his profession </s>
<s>   indeed the worthy
gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on
active service was in great spirits and good humour </s>
<s>  in proof whereof
it may be here remarked that he humourously drank all the beer at a
draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than
fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal </s>
<s> 

supper being endedit may be easily conceived that oliver had no great
appetite for itmr </s>
<s>  sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits
and water and threw himself on the bed </s>
<s>  ordering nancy with many
imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely </s>
<s>   oliver
stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on
a mattress upon the floor </s>
<s>  and the girl mending the fire sat before
it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time </s>
<s> 

for a long time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy
might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice </s>
<s>  but the
girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to
trim the light </s>
<s>   weary with watching and anxiety he at length fell
asleep </s>
<s> 

when he awoke the table was covered with teathings and sikes was
thrusting various articles into the pockets of his greatcoat which
hung over the back of a chair </s>
<s>   nancy was busily engaged in preparing
breakfast </s>
<s>   it was not yet daylight </s>
<s>  for the candle was still burning
and it was quite dark outside </s>
<s>  a sharp rain too was beating against
the windowpanes </s>
<s>  and the sky looked black and cloudy </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  growled sikes as oliver started up </s>
<s>  halfpast five </s>
<s> 
look sharp or youll get no breakfast </s>
<s>  for its late as it is </s>
<s> 

oliver was not long in making his toilet </s>
<s>  having taken some breakfast
he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite
ready </s>
<s> 

nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie
round his throat </s>
<s>  sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his
shoulders </s>
<s>   thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely
pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same
pistol in a sidepocket of his greatcoat clasped it firmly in his
and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away </s>
<s> 

oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope
of meeting a look from the girl </s>
<s>   but she had resumed her old seat in
front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it </s>

chapter xxi

the expedition

it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street </s>
<s>  blowing and
raining hard </s>
<s>  and the clouds looking dull and stormy </s>
<s>   the night had
been very wet </s>
<s>  large pools of water had collected in the road </s>
<s>  and the
kennels were overflowing </s>
<s>   there was a faint glimmering of the coming
day in the sky </s>
<s>  but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the
scene </s>
<s>   the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street
lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the
wet housetops and dreary streets </s>
<s>   there appeared to be nobody
stirring in that quarter of the town </s>
<s>  the windows of the houses were
all closely shut </s>
<s>  and the streets through which they passed were
noiseless and empty </s>
<s> 

by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had
fairly begun to break </s>
<s>   many of the lamps were already extinguished </s>
<s>  a
few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london </s>
<s>  now and
then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by </s>
<s>  the driver
bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner
who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his
arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time </s>
<s>   the
publichouses with gaslights burning inside were already open </s>
<s>   by
degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people
were met with </s>
<s>   then came straggling groups of labourers going to
their work </s>
<s>  then men and women with fishbaskets on their heads </s>
<s> 
donkeycarts laden with vegetables </s>
<s>  chaisecarts filled with livestock
or whole carcasses of meat </s>
<s>  milkwomen with pails </s>
<s>  an unbroken
concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern
suburbs of the town </s>
<s>   as they approached the city the noise and
traffic gradually increased </s>
<s>  when they threaded the streets between
shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and
bustle </s>
<s>   it was as light as it was likely to be till night came on
again and the busy morning of half the london population had begun </s>
<s> 

turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square
mr </s>
<s>  sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican </s>
<s>  thence into
long lane and so into smithfield </s>
<s>  from which latter place arose a
tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement </s>
<s> 

it was marketmorning </s>
<s>   the ground was covered nearly ankledeep with
filth and mire </s>
<s>  a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking
bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest
upon the chimneytops hung heavily above </s>
<s>   all the pens in the centre
of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into
the vacant space were filled with sheep </s>
<s>  tied up to posts by the
gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep </s>
<s> 
countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and
vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass </s>
<s>  the
whistling of drovers the barking dogs the bellowing and plunging of
the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs
the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides </s>
<s> 
the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every
publichouse </s>
<s>  the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and
yelling </s>
<s>  the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every
corner of the market </s>
<s>  and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty
figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the
throng </s>
<s>  rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite
confounded the senses </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the
thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the
numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy </s>
<s>   he nodded
twice or thrice to a passing friend </s>
<s>  and resisting as many
invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they
were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane
into holborn </s>
<s> 

now young un </s>
<s>  said sikes looking up at the clock of st </s>
<s>  andrews
church hard upon seven </s>
<s>  you must step out </s>
<s>   come dont lag behind
already lazylegs </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companions
wrist </s>
<s>  oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast
walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the housebreaker as
well as he could </s>
<s> 

they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park
corner and were on their way to kensington </s>
<s>   when sikes relaxed his
pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind
came up </s>
<s>   seeing hounslow written on it he asked the driver with as
much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far
as isleworth </s>
<s> 

jump up said the man </s>
<s>   is that your boy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting
his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was </s>
<s> 

your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my man </s>
<s> 
inquired the driver </s>
<s>  seeing that oliver was out of breath </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied sikes interposing </s>
<s>   hes used to it </s>
<s> 

here take hold of my hand ned </s>
<s>   in with you </s>
<s> 

thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart </s>
<s>  and the driver
pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest
himself </s>
<s> 

as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and
more where his companion meant to take him </s>
<s>   kensington hammersmith
chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed </s>
<s>  and yet they went on
as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey </s>
<s>   at length
they came to a publichouse called the coach and horses </s>
<s>  a little way
beyond which another road appeared to run off </s>
<s>   and here the cart
stopped </s>
<s> 

sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand
all the while </s>
<s>  and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look
upon him and rapped the sidepocket with his fist in a significant
manner </s>
<s> 

goodbye boy said the man </s>
<s> 

hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake </s>
<s>  hes sulky </s>
<s>   a young
dog </s>
<s>   dont mind him </s>
<s> 

not i </s>
<s>  rejoined the other getting into his cart </s>
<s>   its a fine day
after all </s>
<s>   and he drove away </s>
<s> 

sikes waited until he had fairly gone </s>
<s>  and then telling oliver he
might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his
journey </s>
<s> 

they turned round to the left a short way past the publichouse </s>
<s>  and
then taking a righthand road walked on for a long time </s>
<s>  passing many
large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and
stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town </s>
<s> 
here against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large
letters hampton </s>
<s>   they lingered about in the fields for some
hours </s>
<s>   at length they came back into the town </s>
<s>  and turning into an
old publichouse with a defaced signboard ordered some dinner by the
kitchen fire </s>
<s> 

the kitchen was an old lowroofed room </s>
<s>  with a great beam across the
middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the
fire </s>
<s>  on which were seated several rough men in smockfrocks drinking
and smoking </s>
<s>   they took no notice of oliver </s>
<s>  and very little of sikes </s>
<s> 
and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade
sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their
company </s>
<s> 

they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while <abvr>
sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to
feel quite certain they were not going any further </s>
<s>   being much tired
with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first </s>
<s> 
then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell
asleep </s>
<s> 

it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes </s>
<s>  rousing
himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy
in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint
of ale </s>
<s> 

so youre going on to lower halliford are you </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worseor better
as the case might befor drinking </s>
<s>  and not slow about it neither </s>
<s>   my
horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in
the mornin </s>
<s>  and he wont be long adoing of it </s>
<s>   heres luck to him </s>
<s> 
ecod </s>
<s>  hes a good un </s>
<s> 

could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there </s>
<s>  demanded sikes
pushing the ale towards his new friend </s>
<s> 

if youre going directly i can replied the man looking out of the
pot </s>
<s>   are you going to halliford </s>
<s> 

going on to shepperton replied sikes </s>
<s> 

im your man as far as i go replied the other </s>
<s>   is all paid
becky </s>
<s> 

yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl </s>
<s> 

i say </s>
<s>  said the man with tipsy gravity </s>
<s>  that wont do you know </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s>  rejoined sikes </s>
<s>   youre agoing to accommodate us and
wots to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return </s>
<s> 

the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face </s>
<s> 
having done so he seized sikes by the hand </s>
<s>   and declared he was a
real good fellow </s>
<s>   to which <abvr> sikes replied he was joking </s>
<s>  as if he
had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was </s>
<s> 

after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company
goodnight and went out </s>
<s>  the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see
the party start </s>
<s> 

the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing
outside </s>
<s>   ready harnessed to the cart </s>
<s>   oliver and sikes got in without
any further ceremony </s>
<s>  and the man to whom he belonged having lingered
for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the
world to produce his equal mounted also </s>
<s>   then the hostler was told
to give the horse his head </s>
<s>  and his head being given him he made a
very unpleasant use of it </s>
<s>   tossing it into the air with great disdain
and running into the parlour windows over the way </s>
<s>  after performing
those feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hindlegs
he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right
gallantly </s>
<s> 

the night was very dark </s>
<s>   a damp mist rose from the river and the
marshy ground about </s>
<s>  and spread itself over the dreary fields </s>
<s>   it was
piercing cold too </s>
<s>  all was gloomy and black </s>
<s>  not a word was spoken </s>
<s> 
for the driver had grown sleepy </s>
<s>  and sikes was in no mood to lead him
into conversation </s>
<s>   oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the
cart </s>
<s>  bewildered with alarm and apprehension </s>
<s>  and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as
if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene </s>
<s> 

as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven </s>
<s>   there was a
light in the ferryhouse window opposite </s>
<s>   which streamed across the
road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yewtree with graves
beneath it </s>
<s>   there was a dull sound of falling water not far off </s>
<s>  and
the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind </s>
<s>   it seemed
like quiet music for the repose of the dead </s>
<s> 

sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road </s>
<s> 
two or three miles more and the cart stopped </s>
<s>   sikes alighted took
oliver by the hand and they once again walked on </s>
<s> 

they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected </s>
<s> 
but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes
and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the lights
of a town at no great distance </s>
<s>   on looking intently forward oliver
saw that the water was just below them and that they were coming to
the foot of a bridge </s>
<s> 

sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge </s>
<s>  then
turned suddenly down a bank upon the left </s>
<s> 

the water </s>
<s>  thought oliver turning sick with fear </s>
<s>   he has brought
me to this lonely place to murder me </s>
<s> 

he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for
his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house </s>
<s> 
all ruinous and decayed </s>
<s>   there was a window on each side of the
dilapidated entrance </s>
<s>  and one story above </s>
<s>  but no light was visible </s>
<s> 
the house was dark dismantled </s>
<s>  and the all appearance uninhabited </s>
<s> 

sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low
porch and raised the latch </s>
<s>   the door yielded to the pressure and
they passed in together </s>

chapter xxii

the burglary

hallo </s>
<s>  cried a loud hoarse voice as soon as they set foot in the
passage </s>
<s> 

dont make such a row said sikes bolting the door </s>

toby </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  my pal </s>
<s>  cried the same voice </s>
<s>   a glim barney a glim </s>
<s>  show the
gentleman in barney </s>
<s>  wake up first if convenient </s>
<s> 

the speaker appeared to throw a bootjack or some such article at the
person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers </s>
<s>   for the noise of
a wooden body falling violently was heard </s>
<s>  and then an indistinct
muttering as of a man between sleep and awake </s>
<s> 

do you hear </s>
<s>  cried the same voice </s>
<s>   theres bill sikes in the
passage with nobody to do the civil to him </s>
<s>  and you sleeping there as
if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger </s>
<s>   are you
any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you
thoroughly </s>
<s> 

a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the
room as this interrogatory was put </s>
<s>  and there issued from a door on
the right hand </s>
<s>  first a feeble candle </s>
<s>   and next the form of the same
individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at
the publichouse on saffron hill </s>
<s> 

bister sikes </s>
<s>  exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy </s>
<s>  cub
id sir </s>
<s>  cub id </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s>  you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him </s>
<s> 
quicker </s>
<s>  or i shall tread upon your heels </s>
<s> 

muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him </s>
<s> 
and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken
chairs a table and a very old couch </s>
<s>   on which with his legs much
higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long
clay pipe </s>
<s>   he was dressed in a smartlycut snuffcoloured coat with
large brass buttons </s>
<s>  an orange neckerchief </s>
<s>  a coarse staring
shawlpattern waistcoat </s>
<s>  and drab breeches </s>
<s>   <abvr> crackit for he it
was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face </s>
<s> 
but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew
curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers
ornamented with large common rings </s>
<s>   he was a trifle above the middle
size and apparently rather weak in the legs </s>
<s>  but this circumstance by
no means detracted from his own admiration of his topboots which he
contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction </s>
<s> 

bill my boy </s>
<s>  said this figure turning his head towards the door
im glad to see you </s>
<s>   i was almost afraid youd given it up </s>
<s>   in which
case i should have made a personal wentur </s>
<s>   hallo </s>
<s> 

uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his eyes
rested on oliver <abvr> toby crackit brought himself into a sitting
posture and demanded who that was </s>
<s> 

the boy </s>
<s>   only the boy </s>
<s>  replied sikes drawing a chair towards the
fire </s>
<s> 

wud of bister fagids lads exclaimed barney with a grin </s>
<s> 

fagins eh </s>
<s>  exclaimed toby looking at oliver </s>
<s>   wot an inwalable
boy thatll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels </s>
<s>   his mug is a
fortin to him </s>
<s> 

theretheres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently </s>
<s>  and
stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his
ear </s>
<s>   at which <abvr> crackit laughed immensely and honoured oliver with
a long stare of astonishment </s>
<s> 

now said sikes as he resumed his seat if youll give us something
to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in us </s>
<s>  or
in me at all events </s>
<s>   sit down by the fire younker and rest
yourself </s>
<s>  for youll have to go out with us again tonight though not
very far off </s>
<s> 

oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder </s>
<s>  and drawing a stool
to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarecely knowing
where he was or what was passing around him </s>
<s> 

here said toby as the young jew placed some fragments of food and
a bottle upon the table  success to the crack </s>
<s>   he rose to honour
the toast </s>
<s>  and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner
advanced to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank off its
contents </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes did the same </s>
<s> 

a drain for the boy said toby halffilling a wineglass </s>
<s>  down with
it innocence </s>
<s> 

indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face </s>
<s> 
indeed i

<s>  echoed toby </s>
<s>   do you think i dont know whats good
for you </s>
<s>   tell him to drink it bill </s>

<s>  burn my
body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers </s>
<s>   drink
it you perwerse imp </s>
<s>  drink it </s>
<s> 

frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men oliver hastily
swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a
violent fit of coughing </s>
<s>   which delighted toby crackit and barney and
even drew a smile from the surly <abvr> sikes </s>
<s> 

this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat
nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the
two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap </s>
<s>   oliver
retained his stool by the fire </s>
<s>  barney wrapped in a blanket stretched
himself on the floor </s>
<s>   close outside the fender </s>
<s> 

they slept or appeared to sleep for some time </s>
<s>  nobody stirring but
barney who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire </s>
<s>  oliver fell
into a heavy doze </s>
<s>   imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes
or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some one or other
of the scenes of the past day </s>
<s>   when he was roused by toby crackit
jumping up and declaring it was halfpast one </s>
<s> 

in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively
engaged in busy preparation </s>
<s>   sikes and his companion enveloped their
necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their greatcoats </s>
<s> 
barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he
hastily crammed into the pockets </s>
<s> 

barkers for me barney said toby crackit </s>
<s> 

here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols </s>
<s>  you
loaded them yourself </s>
<s> 

all right </s>
<s>  replied toby stowing them away </s>
<s>   the persuaders </s>
<s> 

ive got em replied sikes </s>
<s> 

crape keys centrebits darkiesnothing forgotten </s>
<s>  inquired toby </s>
<s> 
fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat </s>
<s> 

all right rejoined his companion </s>
<s>   bring them bits of timber
barney </s>
<s>   thats the time of day </s>
<s> 

with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who
having delivered another to toby busied himself in fastening on
olivers cape </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  said sikes holding out his hand </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s>   who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the
air and the drink which had been forced upon him </s>
<s>   put his hand
mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose </s>
<s> 

take his other hand toby said sikes </s>
<s>   look out barney </s>
<s> 

the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet </s>
<s> 
the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them </s>
<s>  barney having
made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again </s>
<s> 

it was now intensely dark </s>
<s>   the fog was much heavier than it had been
in the early part of the night </s>
<s>  and the atmosphere was so damp that
although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes
after leaving the house had become stiff with the halffrozen moisture
that was floating about </s>
<s>   they crossed the bridge and kept on towards
the lights which he had seen before </s>
<s>   they were at no great distance
off </s>
<s>  and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey </s>
<s> 

slap through the town whispered sikes </s>
<s>  therell be nobody in the
way tonight to see us </s>
<s> 

toby acquiesced </s>
<s>  and they hurried through the main street of the little
town which at that late hour was wholly deserted </s>
<s>   a dim light shone
at intervals from some bedroom window </s>
<s>  and the hoarse barking of dogs
occasionally broke the silence of the night </s>
<s>   but there was nobody
abroad </s>
<s>   they had cleared the town as the churchbell struck two </s>
<s> 

quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left hand </s>
<s>  after
walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house
surrounded by a wall </s>
<s>   to the top of which toby crackit scarcely
pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling </s>
<s> 

the boy next said toby </s>
<s>   hoist him up </s>
<s>  ill catch hold of him </s>
<s> 

before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the
arms </s>
<s>  and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass
on the other side </s>
<s>   sikes followed directly </s>
<s>   and they stole cautiously
towards the house </s>
<s> 

and now for the first time oliver wellnigh mad with grief and
terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the
objects of the expedition </s>
<s>   he clasped his hands together and
involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror </s>
<s>   a mist came
before his eyes </s>
<s>  the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face </s>
<s>  his limbs
failed him </s>
<s>  and he sank upon his knees </s>
<s> 

get up </s>
<s>  murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol
from his pocket </s>
<s>  get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  for gods sake let me go </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>  let me run away and die
in the fields </s>
<s>   i will never come near london </s>
<s>  never never </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  pray
have mercy on me and do not make me steal </s>
<s>   for the love of all the
bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me </s>
<s> 

the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had
cocked the pistol when toby striking it from his grasp placed his
hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  cried the man </s>
<s>  it wont answer here </s>
<s>   say another word and
ill do your business myself with a crack on the head </s>
<s>   that makes no
noise and is quite as certain and more genteel </s>
<s>   here bill wrench
the shutter open </s>
<s>   hes game enough now ill engage </s>
<s>   ive seen older
hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold
night </s>
<s> 

sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagins head for sending
oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little
noise </s>
<s>   after some delay and some assistance from toby the shutter to
which he had referred swung open on its hinges </s>
<s> 

it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the
ground at the back of the house </s>
<s>   which belonged to a scullery or
small brewingplace at the end of the passage </s>
<s>   the aperture was so
small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to
defend it more securely </s>
<s>  but it was large enough to admit a boy of
olivers size nevertheless </s>
<s>   a very brief exercise of <abvr> sikes art
sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice </s>
<s>  and it soon stood
wide open also </s>
<s> 

now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern
from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face </s>
<s>  im a
going to put you through there </s>
<s>   take this light </s>
<s>  go softly up the
steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the street
door </s>
<s>  unfasten it and let us in </s>
<s> 

theres a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed
toby </s>
<s>  stand upon one of the hall chairs </s>
<s>   there are three there bill
with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on em </s>
<s>   which is
the old ladys arms </s>
<s> 

keep quiet cant you </s>
<s>  replied sikes with a threatening look </s>
<s>  the
roomdoor is open is it </s>
<s> 

wide replied toby after peeping in to satisfy himself </s>
<s>  the game of
that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog
whos got a bed in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels
wakeful </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  barney ticed him away tonight </s>
<s>   so neat </s>
<s> 

although <abvr> crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed
without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get
to work </s>
<s>   toby complied by first producing his lantern and placing it
on the ground </s>
<s>  then by planting himself firmly with his head against
the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to
make a step of his back </s>
<s>  this was no sooner done than sikes mounting
upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first </s>
<s> 
and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the
floor inside </s>
<s> 

take this lantern said sikes looking into the room </s>
<s>   you see the
stairs afore you </s>
<s> 

oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes </s>
<s>   sikes pointing to
the streetdoor with the pistolbarrel briefly advised him to take
notice that he was within shot all the way </s>
<s>  and that if he faltered he
would fall dead that instant </s>
<s> 

its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper </s>
<s>  directly
i leave go of you do your work </s>
<s>   hark </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  whispered the other man </s>
<s> 

they listened intently </s>
<s> 

nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver </s>
<s>   now </s>
<s> 

in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly
resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make one
effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family </s>
<s>   filled
with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily </s>
<s> 

come back </s>
<s>  suddenly cried sikes aloud </s>
<s>   back </s>
<s>  back </s>
<s> 

scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and
by a loud cry which followed it oliver let his lantern fall and knew
not whether to advance or fly </s>
<s> 

the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified
halfdressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa
flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere but where he knew
notand he staggered back </s>
<s> 

sikes had disappeared for an instant </s>
<s>  but he was up again and had him
by the collar before the smoke had cleared away </s>
<s>   he fired his own
pistol after the men who were already retreating </s>
<s>  and dragged the boy
up </s>
<s> 

clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the
window </s>
<s>   give me a shawl here </s>
<s>   theyve hit him </s>
<s>   quick </s>
<s>   how the boy
bleeds </s>
<s> 

then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of
firearms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried
over uneven ground at a rapid pace </s>
<s>   and then the noises grew confused
in the distance </s>
<s>  and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart </s>
<s> 
and he saw or heard no more </s>

chapter xxiii

which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between <abvr>
bumble and a lady </s>
<s>  and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on
some points

the night was bitter cold </s>
<s>   the snow lay on the ground frozen into a
hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways
and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad </s>
<s>   which
as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it
savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies
scattered it in air </s>
<s>   bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night
for the wellhoused and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god
they were at home </s>
<s>  and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him
down and die </s>
<s>   many hungerworn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may
can hardly open them in a more bitter world </s>
<s> 

such was the aspect of outofdoors affairs when <abvr> corney the
matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already
introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist sat herself down before a
cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree
of complacency at a small round table </s>
<s>   on which stood a tray of
corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most
grateful meal that matrons enjoy </s>
<s>   in fact <abvr> corney was about to
solace herself with a cup of tea </s>
<s>  as she glanced from the table to the
fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a
small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently
increasedso much so indeed that <abvr> corney smiled </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking
reflectively at the fire </s>
<s>  im sure we have all on us a great deal to
be grateful for </s>
<s>   a great deal if we did but know it </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental
blindness of those paupers who did not know it </s>
<s>  and thrusting a silver
spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a twoounce tin
teacaddy proceeded to make the tea </s>
<s> 

how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds </s>
<s>   the
black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while <abvr>
corney was moralising </s>
<s>  and the water slightly scalded <abvr> corneys
hand </s>
<s> 

drat the pot </s>
<s>  said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on
the hob </s>
<s>  a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups </s>
<s> 
what use is it of to anybody </s>
<s>   except said <abvr> corney pausing
except to a poor desolate creature like me </s>
<s>   oh dear </s>
<s> 

with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more
resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate </s>
<s>   the
small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad
recollections of <abvr> corney who had not been dead more than
fiveandtwenty years </s>
<s>  and she was overpowered </s>
<s> 

i shall never get another </s>
<s>  said <abvr> corney pettishly </s>
<s>  i shall
never get anotherlike him </s>
<s> 

whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is
uncertain </s>
<s>   it might have been the latter </s>
<s>  for <abvr> corney looked at it
as she spoke </s>
<s>  and took it up afterwards </s>
<s>   she had just tasted her first
cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the roomdoor </s>
<s> 

oh come in with you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> corney sharply </s>
<s>   some of the old
women dying i suppose </s>
<s>   they always die when im at meals </s>
<s>  dont stand
there letting the cold air in dont </s>
<s>   whats amiss now eh </s>
<s> 

nothing maam nothing replied a mans voice </s>

<s>  exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s>

outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat </s>
<s>  and
who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
bundle in the other </s>
<s>   shall i shut the door maam </s>
<s> 

the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any
impropriety in holding an interview with <abvr> bumble with closed doors </s>

himself shut it without permission </s>

hard weather <abvr> bumble said the matron </s>
<s> 

hard indeed maam replied the beadle </s>
<s>   antiporochial weather
this maam </s>
<s>   we have given away <abvr> corney we have given away a
matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very
blessed afternoon </s>
<s>  and yet them paupers are not contented </s>
<s> 

of course not </s>
<s>   when would they be <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  said the matron
sipping her tea </s>
<s> 

when indeed maam </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   why heres one man that
in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and
a good pound of cheese full weight </s>
<s>   is he grateful maam </s>
<s>   is he
grateful </s>
<s>   not a copper farthings worth of it </s>
<s>   what does he do
maam but ask for a few coals </s>
<s>  if its only a pocket handkerchief
full he says </s>
<s>   coals </s>
<s>  what would he do with coals </s>
<s>   toast his cheese
with em and then come back for more </s>
<s>   thats the way with these
people maam </s>
<s>  give em a apron full of coals today and theyll come
back for another the day after tomorrow as brazen as alabaster </s>
<s> 

the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible
simile </s>
<s>  and the beadle went on </s>
<s> 

i never said <abvr> bumble see anything like the pitch its got to </s>
<s> 
the day afore yesterday a manyou have been a married woman maam
and i may mention it to youa man with hardly a rag upon his back
here <abvr> corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door
when he has got company coming to dinner </s>
<s>  and says he must be
relieved <abvr> corney </s>
<s>   as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company
very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a
pint of oatmeal </s>
<s>   my heart </s>
<s>  says the ungrateful villain whats the
use of this to me </s>
<s>   you might as well give me a pair of iron
spectacles </s>
<s>   very good says our overseer taking em away again
you wont get anything else here </s>
<s>   then ill die in the streets </s>
<s> 
says the vagrant </s>
<s>   oh no you wont says our overseer </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   that was very good </s>
<s>   so like <abvr> grannett wasnt it </s>
<s> 
interposed the matron </s>
<s>   well <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

well maam rejoined the beadle he went away </s>
<s>  and he did die in
the streets </s>
<s>   theres a obstinate pauper for you </s>
<s> 

it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron
emphatically </s>
<s>   but dont you think outofdoor relief a very bad
thing any way <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   youre a gentleman of experience and
ought to know </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious
of superior information outofdoor relief properly managed </s>
<s> 
properly managed maam </s>
<s>  is the porochial safeguard </s>
<s>   the great
principle of outofdoor relief is to give the paupers exactly what
they dont want </s>
<s>  and then they get tired of coming </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> corney </s>
<s>   well that is a good one too </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   betwixt you and me maam returned <abvr> bumble thats the
great principle </s>
<s>  and thats the reason why if you look at any cases
that get into them owdacious newspapers youll always observe that
sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese </s>
<s>   thats the
rule now <abvr> corney all over the country </s>
<s>  but however said the
beadle stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets
maam </s>
<s>  not to be spoken of </s>
<s>  except as i may say among the porochial
officers such as ourselves </s>
<s>  this is the port wine maam that the
board ordered for the infirmary </s>
<s>  real fresh genuine port wine </s>
<s>  only
out of the cask this forenoon </s>
<s>  clear as a bell and no sediment </s>
<s> 

having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to
test its excellence <abvr> bumble placed them both on top of a chest of
drawers </s>
<s>  folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped </s>
<s>  put it
carefully in his pocket </s>
<s>  and took up his hat as if to go </s>
<s> 

youll have a very cold walk <abvr> bumble said the matron </s>
<s> 

it blows maam replied <abvr> bumble turning up his coatcollar
enough to cut ones ears off </s>
<s> 

the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was
moving towards the door </s>
<s>  and as the beadle coughed preparatory to
bidding her goodnight bashfully inquired whetherwhether he wouldnt
take a cup of tea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again </s>
<s>  laid his hat
and stick upon a chair </s>
<s>  and drew another chair up to the table </s>
<s>   as he
slowly seated himself he looked at the lady </s>
<s>   she fixed her eyes upon
the little teapot </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble coughed again and slightly smiled </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet </s>
<s>  as she
sat down her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle </s>
<s> 
she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea </s>
<s>   again
mr </s>
<s>  bumble coughedlouder this time than he had coughed yet </s>
<s> 

sweet </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  inquired the matron taking up the sugarbasin </s>
<s> 

very sweet indeed maam replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   he fixed his eyes on
mrs </s>
<s>  corney as he said this </s>
<s>  and if ever a beadle looked tender <abvr>
bumble was that beadle at that moment </s>
<s> 

the tea was made and handed in silence </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble having spread a
handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the
splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink </s>
<s>  varying these
amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh </s>
<s>  which however had
no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather
seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department </s>
<s> 

you have a cat maam i see said <abvr> bumble glancing at one who
in the centre of her family was basking before the fire </s>
<s>  and kittens
too i declare </s>
<s> 

i am so fond of them <abvr> bumble you cant think replied the
matron </s>
<s>   theyre so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that
they are quite companions for me </s>
<s> 

very nice animals maam replied <abvr> bumble approvingly </s>
<s>  so very
domestic </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  rejoined the matron with enthusiasm </s>
<s>  so fond of their home
too that its quite a pleasure im sure </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney maam said <abvr> bumble slowly and marking the time
with his teaspoon i mean to say this maam </s>
<s>  that any cat or kitten
that could live with you maam and not be fond of its home must be
a ass maam </s>
<s> 

oh <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  remonstrated <abvr> corney </s>
<s> 

its of no use disguising facts maam said <abvr> bumble slowly
flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him
doubly impressive </s>
<s>  i would drown it myself with pleasure </s>
<s> 

then youre a cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out
her hand for the beadles cup </s>
<s>  and a very hardhearted man besides </s>
<s> 

hardhearted maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   hard </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble resigned
his cup without another word </s>
<s>  squeezed <abvr> corneys little finger as
she took it </s>
<s>  and inflicting two openhanded slaps upon his laced
waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little
morsel farther from the fire </s>
<s> 

it was a round table </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> corney and <abvr> bumble had been
sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and
fronting the fire it will be seen that <abvr> bumble in receding from
the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance
between himself and <abvr> corney </s>
<s>  which proceeding some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great
heroism on <abvr> bumbles part </s>
<s>   he being in some sort tempted by time
place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft nothings
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other
great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle </s>
<s>   who as is well known should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all </s>
<s> 

whatever were <abvr> bumbles intentions however and no doubt they were
of the best </s>
<s>  it unfortunately happened as has been twice before
remarked that the table was a round one </s>
<s>  consequently <abvr> bumble
moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the
distance between himself and the matron </s>
<s>  and continuing to travel
round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close
to that in which the matron was seated </s>
<s> 

indeed the two chairs touched </s>
<s>  and when they did so <abvr> bumble
stopped </s>
<s> 

now if the matron had moved her chair to the right she would have
been scorched by the fire </s>
<s>  and if to the left she must have fallen
into <abvr> bumbles arms </s>
<s>  so being a discreet matron and no doubt
foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was
and handed <abvr> bumble another cup of tea </s>
<s> 

hardhearted <abvr> corney </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble stirring his tea and
looking up into the matrons face </s>
<s>  are you hardhearted <abvr>
corney </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a
single man </s>
<s>   what can you want to know for <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the beadle drank his tea to the last drop </s>
<s>  finished a piece of toast </s>
<s> 
whisked the crumbs off his knees </s>
<s>  wiped his lips </s>
<s>  and deliberately
kissed the matron </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>  cried that discreet lady in a whisper </s>
<s>  for the fright was
so great that she had quite lost her voice <abvr> bumble i shall
scream </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble made no reply </s>
<s>  but in a slow and dignified manner
put his arm round the matrons waist </s>
<s> 

as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would
have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was
rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door </s>
<s>   which was no
sooner heard than <abvr> bumble darted with much agility to the wine
bottles and began dusting them with great violence </s>
<s>   while the matron
sharply demanded who was there </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy
of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that
her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity </s>
<s> 

if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously
ugly </s>
<s>   putting her head in at the door old sally is agoing fast </s>
<s> 

well whats that to me </s>
<s>  angrily demanded the matron </s>
<s>   i cant keep
her alive can i </s>
<s> 

no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can </s>
<s>  shes far
beyond the reach of help </s>
<s>   ive seen a many people die </s>
<s>  little babes
and great strong men </s>
<s>  and i know when deaths acoming well enough </s>
<s> 
but shes troubled in her mind </s>
<s>  and when the fits are not on herand
thats not often for she is dying very hardshe says she has got
something to tell which you must hear </s>
<s>   shell never die quiet till
you come mistress </s>
<s> 

at this intelligence the worthy <abvr> corney muttered a variety of
invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely
annoying their betters </s>
<s>  and muffling herself in a thick shawl which
she hastily caught up briefly requested <abvr> bumble to stay till she
came back lest anything particular should occur </s>
<s>   bidding the
messenger walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs she
followed her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable </s>
<s> 
he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugartongs
closely inspected a silver milkpot to ascertain that it was of the
genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put
on his cocked hat cornerwise and danced with much gravity four
distinct times round the table </s>
<s> 

having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off
the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his
back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact
inventory of the furniture </s>
<s> 



chapter xxiv

treats on a very poor subject </s>
<s>   but is a short one and may be found of
importance in this history

it was no unfit messenger of death who had disturbed the quiet of the
matrons room </s>
<s>   her body was bent by age </s>
<s>  her limbs trembled with
palsy </s>
<s>  her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the
grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>   how few of natures faces are left alone to gladden us with
their beauty </s>
<s>   the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world
change them as they change hearts </s>
<s>  and it is only when those passions
sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass
off and leave heavens surface clear </s>
<s>   it is a common thing for the
countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to
subside into the longforgotten expression of sleeping infancy and
settle into the very look of early life </s>
<s>  so calm so peaceful do they
grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by
the coffins side in awe and see the angel even upon earth </s>
<s> 

the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering
some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion </s>
<s>  being at
length compelled to pause for breath she gave the light into her hand
and remained behind to follow as she might </s>
<s>  while the more nimble
superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay </s>
<s> 

it was a bare garretroom with a dim light burning at the farther end </s>
<s> 
there was another old woman watching by the bed </s>
<s>  the parish
apothecarys apprentice was standing by the fire making a toothpick
out of a quill </s>
<s> 

cold night <abvr> corney said this young gentleman as the matron
entered </s>
<s> 

very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil
tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke </s>
<s> 

you should get better coals out of your contractors said the
apothecarys deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker </s>
<s>  these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night </s>
<s> 

theyre the boards choosing sir returned the matron </s>
<s>  the least
they could do would be to keep us pretty warm </s>
<s>   for our places are
hard enough </s>
<s> 

the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said the young mag turning his face towards the bed as if he
had previously quite forgotten the patient its all u </s>
<s> p </s>
<s>  there <abvr>
corney </s>
<s> 

it is is it sir </s>
<s>  asked the matron </s>
<s> 

if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the
apothecarys apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point </s>
<s>  its a
breakup of the system altogether </s>
<s>   is she dozing old lady </s>
<s> 

the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain </s>
<s>  and nodded in the
affirmative </s>
<s> 

then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said
the young man </s>
<s>   put the light on the floor </s>
<s>   she wont see it there </s>
<s> 

the attendant did as she was told </s>
<s>   shaking her head meanwhile to
intimate that the woman would not die so easily </s>
<s>  having done so she
resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time
returned </s>
<s>   the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped
herself in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed </s>
<s> 

the apothecarys apprentice having completed the manufacture of the
toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
for ten minutes or so </s>
<s>   when apparently growing rather dull he wished
mrs </s>
<s>  corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe </s>
<s> 

when they had sat in silence for some time the two old women rose from
the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to
catch the heat </s>
<s>   the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled
faces and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position
they began to converse in a low voice </s>
<s> 

did she say any more anny dear while i was gone </s>
<s>  inquired the
messenger </s>
<s> 

not a word replied the other </s>
<s>   she plucked and tore at her arms for
a little time </s>
<s>  but i held her hands and she soon dropped off </s>
<s>   she
hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet </s>
<s>   i aint so
weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s> 

did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have </s>
<s>  demanded
the first </s>
<s> 

i tried to get it down rejoined the other </s>
<s>   but her teeth were
tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i
could do to get it back again </s>
<s>   so i drank it </s>
<s>  and it did me good </s>
<s> 

looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard
the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily </s>
<s> 

i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done
the same and made rare fun of it afterwards </s>
<s> 

ay that she would rejoined the other </s>
<s>  she had a merry heart </s>
<s>  a
many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as
waxwork </s>
<s>   my old eyes have seen themay and those old hands touched
them too </s>
<s>  for i have helped her scores of times </s>
<s> 

stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature
shook them exultingly before her face and fumbling in her pocket
brought out an old timediscoloured tin snuffbox from which she shook
a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few
more into her own </s>
<s>   while they were thus employed the matron who had
been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her
stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to
wait </s>
<s> 

not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her
face </s>
<s>   we have none of us long to wait for death </s>
<s>   patience patience </s>
<s> 
hell be here soon enough for us all </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue you doting idiot </s>
<s>  said the matron sternly </s>
<s>  you
martha tell me </s>
<s>  has she been in this way before </s>
<s> 

often answered the first woman </s>
<s> 

but will never be again added the second one </s>
<s>  that is shell never
wake again but onceand mind mistress that wont be for long </s>
<s> 

long or short said the matron snappishly she wont find me here
when she does wake </s>
<s>  take care both of you how you worry me again for
nothing </s>
<s>   its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house
die and i wontthats more </s>
<s>  mind that you impudent old harridans </s>
<s> 
if you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you </s>
<s> 

she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned
towards the bed caused her to look round </s>
<s>   the patient had raised
herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them </s>
<s> 

whos that </s>
<s>  she cried in a hollow voice </s>
<s> 

hush hush </s>
<s>  said one of the women stooping over her </s>
<s>   lie down lie
down </s>
<s> 

ill never lie down again alive </s>
<s>  said the woman struggling </s>
<s>  i
will tell her </s>
<s>   come here </s>
<s>   nearer </s>
<s>   let me whisper in your ear </s>
<s> 

she clutched the matron by the arm and forcing her into a chair by the
bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of
the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners </s>
<s> 

turn them away said the woman drowsily </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s> 

the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous
lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best
friends </s>
<s>  and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never
leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the
door and returned to the bedside </s>
<s>   on being excluded the old ladies
changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was
drunk </s>
<s>  which indeed was not unlikely </s>
<s>  since in addition to a
moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring
under the effects of a final taste of ginandwater which had been
privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy
old ladies themselves </s>
<s> 

now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great
effort to revive one latent spark of energy </s>
<s>   in this very roomin
this very bedi once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought
into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all
soiled with dust and blood </s>

thinkwhat was the year again </s>
<s> 

never mind the year said the impatient auditor </s>
<s>  what about her </s>

ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state
what about her </s>

<s>  she cried jumping fiercely up </s>

her face flushed and her eyes starting from her headi robbed her
so i did </s>

she would call for help </s>
<s> 

it </s>
<s>  replied the woman laying her hand over the others mouth </s>
<s>  the
only thing she had </s>
<s>   she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to
eat </s>
<s>  but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom </s>
<s>   it was gold i
tell you </s>

gold </s>
<s>  echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell
back </s>
<s>   go on go onyeswhat of it </s>
<s>   who was the mother </s>
<s>  when was
it </s>
<s> 

she charged me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and
trusted me as the only woman about her </s>

no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as
they came more faintly from the dying woman </s>

the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than before </s>
<s> 
the mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in
my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come
when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
named </s>

<s>  she said folding her thin hands
together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child
abandoned to its mercy </s>

the boys name </s>

<s> 

they called him oliver replied the woman feebly </s>
<s>   the gold i
stole was

yes yeswhat </s>
<s>  cried the other </s>
<s> 

she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply </s>
<s>  but drew
back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a
sitting posture </s>
<s>  then clutching the coverlid with both hands muttered
some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the bed </s>
<s> 

                              

stone dead </s>
<s>  said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the
door was opened </s>
<s> 

and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking
carelessly away </s>
<s> 

the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the
preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left
alone hovering about the body </s>

chapter xxv

wherein this history reverts to <abvr> fagin and company

while these things were passing in the country workhouse <abvr> fagin sat
in the old denthe same from which oliver had been removed by the
girlbrooding over a dull smoky fire </s>
<s>   he held a pair of bellows upon
his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it
into more cheerful action </s>
<s>  but he had fallen into deep thought </s>
<s>  and
with his arms folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed
his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars </s>
<s> 

at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and
mr </s>
<s>  chitling </s>
<s>  all intent upon a game of whist </s>
<s>  the artful taking dummy
against master bates and <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   the countenance of the
firstnamed gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired
great additional interest from his close observance of the game and
his attentive perusal of <abvr> chitlings hand </s>
<s>  upon which from time to
time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances </s>
<s> 
wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon
his neighbours cards </s>
<s>   it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat
as indeed was often his custom within doors </s>
<s>   he also sustained a
clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space
when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot
upon the table which stood ready filled with ginandwater for the
accommodation of the company </s>
<s> 

master bates was also attentive to the play </s>
<s>  but being of a more
excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that
he more frequently applied himself to the ginandwater and moreover
indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a
scientific rubber </s>
<s>   indeed the artful presuming upon their close
attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his
companion upon these improprieties </s>
<s>  all of which remonstrances master
bates received in extremely good part </s>
<s>  merely requesting his friend to
be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some
other neatlyturned witticism of a similar kind the happy application
of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of <abvr> chitling </s>
<s> 
it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably
lost </s>
<s>  and that the circumstance so far from angering master bates
appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had
never seen such a jolly game in all his born days </s>
<s> 

thats two doubles and the rub said <abvr> chitling with a very long
face as he drew halfacrown from his waistcoatpocket </s>
<s>   i never see
such a feller as you jack </s>
<s>  you win everything </s>
<s>   even when weve good
cards charley and i cant make nothing of em </s>
<s> 

either the master or the manner of this remark which was made very
ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of
laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire
what was the matter </s>
<s> 

matter fagin </s>
<s>  cried charley </s>
<s>   i wish you had watched the play </s>
<s>

that he was at no loss to understand the reason </s>

<s>  you must put your boots on overnight
and have a telescope at each eye and a operaglass between your
shoulders if you want to come over him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy
and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first
picturecard at a shilling at a time </s>
<s>   nobody accepting the challenge
and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to amuse
himself by sketching a groundplan of newgate on the table with the
piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters </s>
<s>  whistling
meantime with peculiar shrillness </s>
<s> 

how precious dull you are tommy </s>
<s>  said the dodger stopping short
when there had been a long silence </s>
<s>  and addressing <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   what
do you think hes thinking of fagin </s>
<s> 

how should i know my dear </s>
<s>  replied the jew looking round as he
plied the bellows </s>
<s>   about his losses maybe </s>
<s>  or the little retirement
in the country that hes just left eh </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   is that it my dear </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of
discourse as <abvr> chitling was about to reply </s>
<s>   what do you say

<s>

uncommon sweet upon betsy </s>

<s>   oh my eye </s>
<s> 
heres a merrygorounder </s>
<s>   tommy chitlings in love </s>
<s>   oh fagin
fagin </s>
<s>  what a spree </s>
<s> 

thoroughly overpowered with the notion of <abvr> chitling being the victim
of the tender passion master bates threw himself back in his chair
with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the
floor </s>
<s>  where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at
full length until his laugh was over when he resumed his former
position and began another laugh </s>
<s> 

never mind him my dear said the jew winking at <abvr> dawkins and
giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows </s>
<s> 
betsys a fine girl </s>
<s>   stick up to her tom </s>
<s>   stick up to her </s>
<s>

<s>   but it turned out a
good job for you </s>
<s>  didnt it fagin </s>
<s>   and whats six weeks of it </s>
<s>   it

you dont want to go out awalking so much </s>
<s>  eh fagin </s>
<s>

<s>

upon charley and the jew if bet was all right </s>
<s> 

i mean to say that i shouldnt replied tom angrily </s>
<s>  there now </s>
<s> 
ah </s>
<s>   wholl say as much as that i should like to know </s>
<s>  eh fagin </s>
<s>

<s>  not a soul tom </s>
<s>   i dont know one
of em that would do it besides you </s>
<s>  not one of em my dear </s>
<s> 

i might have got clear off if id split upon her </s>
<s>  mightnt i fagin </s>
<s> 
angrily pursued the poor halfwitted dupe </s>
<s>   a word from me would have
done it </s>
<s>  wouldnt it fagin </s>
<s> 

to be sure it would my dear replied the jew </s>
<s> 

but i didnt blab it </s>
<s>  did i fagin </s>
<s>  demanded tom pouring question
upon question with great volubility </s>
<s> 

no no to be sure replied the jew </s>
<s>  you were too stouthearted for
that </s>
<s>   a deal too stout my dear </s>
<s> 

perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round </s>
<s>  and if i was whats to
laugh at in that </s>
<s>  eh fagin </s>
<s> 

the jew perceiving that <abvr> chitling was considerably roused hastened
to assure him that nobody was laughing </s>
<s>  and to prove the gravity of the
company appealed to master bates the principal offender </s>
<s>   but
unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never
more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a
violent roar that the abused <abvr> chitling without any preliminary
ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender </s>
<s> 
who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose
his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood
panting for breath while <abvr> chitling looked on in intense dismay </s>
<s> 

hark </s>
<s>  cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler </s>
<s> 
catching up the light he crept softly upstairs </s>
<s> 

the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in
darkness </s>
<s>   after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered
fagin mysteriously </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the jew alone </s>
<s> 

the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the
candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb
show that he had better not be funny just then </s>
<s>   having performed this
friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his
directions </s>
<s> 

the old man bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds </s>
<s>  his
face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and
feared to know the worst </s>
<s>   at length he raised his head </s>
<s> 

where is he </s>
<s>  he asked </s>
<s> 

the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to
leave the room </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry </s>
<s>  bring him down </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 
quiet charley </s>
<s>   gently tom </s>
<s>   scarce scarce </s>
<s> 

this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist was
softly and immediately obeyed </s>
<s>   there was no sound of their whereabout
when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand
and followed by a man in a coarse smockfrock </s>
<s>  who after casting a
hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had
concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosed </s>
<s>  all haggard
unwashed and unshorn </s>
<s>  the features of flash toby crackit </s>
<s> 

how are you faguey </s>
<s>  said this worthy nodding to the jew </s>
<s>  pop that
shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it
when i cut </s>
<s>  thats the time of day </s>
<s>   youll be a fine young cracksman
afore the old file now </s>
<s> 

with these words he pulled up the smockfrock </s>
<s>  and winding it round
his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob </s>
<s> 

see there faguey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots </s>
<s> 
not a drop of day and martin since you know when </s>
<s>  not a bubble of
blacking by jove </s>
<s>    but dont look at me in that way man </s>
<s>   all in
good time </s>
<s>   i cant talk about business till ive eat and drank </s>
<s>  so
produce the sustainance and lets have a quiet fillout for the first
time these three days </s>
<s> 

the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon
the table </s>
<s>  and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his
leisure </s>
<s> 

to judge from appearances toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
conversation </s>
<s>   at first the jew contented himself with patiently
watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue
to the intelligence he brought </s>
<s>  but in vain </s>
<s> 

he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon
his features that they always wore </s>
<s>   and through dirt and beard and
whisker there still shone unimpaired the selfsatisfied smirk of
flash toby crackit </s>
<s>  then the jew in an agony of impatience watched
every morsel he put into his mouth </s>
<s>  pacing up and down the room
meanwhile in irrepressible excitement </s>
<s>   it was all of no use </s>
<s>   toby
continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could
eat no more </s>
<s>  then ordering the dodger out he closed the door mixed a
glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking </s>
<s> 

first and foremost faguey said toby </s>
<s> 

yes yes </s>
<s>  interposed the jew drawing up his chair </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to
declare that the gin was excellent </s>
<s>  then placing his feet against the
low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his
eye he quietly resumed </s>
<s> 

first and foremost faguey said the housebreaker hows bill </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  screamed the jew starting from his seat </s>
<s> 

why you dont mean to say began toby turning pale </s>
<s>

<s>  cried the jew stamping furiously on the ground </s>
<s>  where are
they </s>
<s>   sikes and the boy </s>
<s>   where are they </s>
<s>   where have they been </s>
<s> 
where are they hiding </s>
<s>   why have they not been here </s>
<s> 

the crack failed said toby faintly </s>
<s> 

i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his pocket and
pointing to it </s>
<s>   what more </s>
<s> 

they fired and hit the boy </s>
<s>   we cut over the fields at the back with
him between usstraight as the crow fliesthrough hedge and ditch </s>
<s> 
they gave chase </s>
<s>   damme </s>
<s>  the whole country was awake and the dogs upon
us </s>
<s> 

the boy </s>
<s> 

bill had him on his back and scudded like the wind </s>
<s>   we stopped to
take him between us </s>
<s>  his head hung down and he was cold </s>
<s>  they were
close upon our heels </s>
<s>  every man for himself and each from the gallows </s>
<s> 
we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch </s>
<s>   alive or
dead thats all i know about him </s>

the jew stopped to hear no more </s>
<s>  but uttering a loud yell and twining
his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house </s>

chapter xxvi

in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene </s>
<s>  and many
things inseparable from this history are done and performed

the old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover
the effect of toby crackits intelligence </s>
<s>   he had relaxed nothing of
his unusual speed </s>
<s>  but was still pressing onward in the same wild and
disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage </s>
<s>  and a
boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger </s>
<s>   drove him
back upon the pavement </s>
<s>   avoiding as much as was possible all the
main streets and skulking only through the byways and alleys he at
length emerged on snow hill </s>
<s>   here he walked even faster than before </s>
<s> 
nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court </s>
<s>  when as if
conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual
shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely </s>
<s> 

near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon
the right hand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley
leading to saffron hill </s>
<s>   in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns </s>
<s> 
for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets </s>
<s> 
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the
windows or flaunting from the doorposts </s>
<s>  and the shelves within are
piled with them </s>
<s>  confined as the limits of field lane are it has its
barber its coffeeshop its beershop and its friedfish warehouse </s>
<s> 
it is a commercial colony of itself </s>
<s>   the emporium of petty larceny </s>
<s> 
visited at early morning and settingin of dusk by silent merchants
who traffic in dark backparlours and who go as strangely as they
come </s>
<s>   here the clothesman the shoevamper and the ragmerchant
display their goods as signboards to the petty thief </s>
<s>  here stores of
old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollenstuff and
linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars </s>
<s> 

it was into this place that the jew turned </s>
<s>   he was well known to the
sallow denizens of the lane </s>
<s>  for such of them as were on the lookout
to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along </s>
<s>  he replied to
their salutations in the same way </s>
<s>  but bestowed no closer recognition
until he reached the further end of the alley </s>
<s>  when he stopped to
address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his
person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a
pipe at his warehouse door </s>
<s> 

why the sight of you <abvr> fagin would cure the hoptalmy </s>
<s>  said this
respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his
health </s>
<s> 

the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating
his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders </s>
<s> 

well ive heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied
the trader </s>
<s>  but it soon cools down again </s>
<s>  dont you find it so </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded in the affirmative </s>
<s>   pointing in the direction of saffron
hill he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight </s>
<s> 

at the cripples </s>
<s>  inquired the man </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded </s>
<s> 

let me see pursued the merchant reflecting </s>
<s> 

yes theres some halfdozen of em gone in that i knows </s>
<s>  i dont
think your friends there </s>
<s> 

sikes is not i suppose </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with a disappointed
countenance </s>
<s> 

non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking
his head and looking amazingly sly </s>
<s>   have you got anything in my line
tonight </s>
<s> 

nothing tonight said the jew turning away </s>
<s> 

are you going up to the cripples fagin </s>
<s>  cried the little man
calling after him </s>
<s>   stop </s>
<s>   i dont mind if i have a drop there with
you </s>
<s> 

but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he
preferred being alone </s>
<s>  and moreover as the little man could not very
easily disengage himself from the chair </s>
<s>  the sign of the cripples was
for a time bereft of the advantage of <abvr> livelys presence </s>
<s>   by the
time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared </s>
<s>  so <abvr> lively
after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight
of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a
shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and
mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour </s>
<s> 

the three cripples or rather the cripples </s>
<s>  which was the sign by which
the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons </s>
<s>   was the
publichouse in which <abvr> sikes and his dog have already figured </s>
<s> 
merely making a sign to a man at the bar fagin walked straight
upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating
himself into the chamber looked anxiously about </s>
<s>  shading his eyes with
his hand as if in search of some particular person </s>
<s> 

the room was illuminated by two gaslights </s>
<s>  the glare of which was
prevented by the barred shutters and closelydrawn curtains of faded
red from being visible outside </s>
<s>   the ceiling was blackened to prevent
its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps </s>
<s>  and the
place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely
possible to discern anything more </s>
<s>   by degrees however as some of it
cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused
as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out </s>
<s>  and as the eye
grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware
of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a
long table </s>
<s>  at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of
office in his hand </s>
<s>  while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose
and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a
jingling piano in a remote corner </s>
<s> 

as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over
the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a
song </s>
<s>  which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the
company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the
accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could </s>
<s>   when
this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the
professional gentleman on the chairmans right and left volunteered a
duet and sang it with great applause </s>
<s> 

it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
among the group </s>
<s>   there was the chairman himself the landlord of the
house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were
proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give
himself up to joviality had an eye for everything that was done and
an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones too </s>
<s>   near him
were the singers </s>
<s>  receiving with professional indifference the
compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a
dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more
boisterous admirers </s>
<s>  whose countenances expressive of almost every
vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by
their very repulsiveness </s>
<s>   cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its
stages were there in their strongest aspect </s>
<s>  and women </s>
<s>  some with the
last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you
looked </s>
<s>   others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten
out and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime </s>
<s> 
some mere girls others but young women and none past the prime of
life </s>
<s>  formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture </s>
<s> 

fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face
while these proceedings were in progress </s>
<s>  but apparently without
meeting that of which he was in search </s>
<s>  succeeding at length in
catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him
slightly and left the room as quietly as he had entered it </s>
<s> 

what can i do for you <abvr> fagin </s>
<s>  inquired the man as he followed
him out to the landing </s>
<s>   wont you join us </s>
<s>   theyll be delighted
every one of em </s>
<s> 

the jew shook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he
here </s>
<s> 

no replied the man </s>
<s> 

and no news of barney </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s> 

none replied the landlord of the cripples </s>
<s>  for it was he </s>
<s>  he wont
stir till its all safe </s>
<s>   depend on it theyre on the scent down
there </s>
<s>  and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once </s>
<s>   hes
all right enough barney is else i should have heard of him </s>
<s>   ill
pound it that barneys managing properly </s>
<s>  let him alone for that </s>
<s> 

will he be here tonight </s>
<s>  asked the jew laying the same emphasis
on the pronoun as before </s>
<s> 

monks do you mean </s>
<s>  inquired the landlord hesitating </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob </s>
<s>  i
expected him here before now </s>
<s>   if youll wait ten minutes hell be

no no said the jew hastily </s>
<s>  as though however desirous he might
be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence </s>
<s>   tell him i came here to see him </s>
<s>  and that he must come to me
tonight </s>
<s>   no say tomorrow </s>
<s>   as he is not here tomorrow will be
time enough </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s>   nothing more </s>
<s> 

not a word now said the jew descending the stairs </s>
<s> 

i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a
hoarse whisper </s>
<s>  what a time this would be for a sell </s>
<s>   ive got phil
barker here </s>
<s>  so drunk that a boy might take him </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up </s>
<s> 

phil has something more to do before we can afford to part with him </s>
<s> 
so go back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry
liveswhile they last </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh </s>
<s>  and returned to his
guests </s>
<s>   the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its
former expression of anxiety and thought </s>
<s>   after a brief reflection he
called a hackcabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green </s>
<s> 
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of <abvr> sikess
residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot </s>
<s> 

now muttered the jew as he knocked at the door if there is any
deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you
are </s>
<s> 

she was in her room the woman said </s>
<s>   fagin crept softly upstairs and
entered it without any previous ceremony </s>
<s>   the girl was alone </s>
<s>  lying
with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it </s>
<s> 

she has been drinking thought the jew cooly or perhaps she is
only miserable </s>
<s> 

the old man turned to close the door as he made this reflection </s>
<s>  the
noise thus occasioned roused the girl </s>
<s>   she eyed his crafty face
narrowly as she inquired to his recital of toby crackits story </s>
<s>   when
it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a
word </s>
<s>   she pushed the candle impatiently away </s>
<s>  and once or twice as she
feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground </s>
<s>  but
this was all </s>
<s> 

during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to
assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly
returned </s>
<s>   apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice
or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation </s>
<s>  but the
girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone </s>
<s>   at length
he made another attempt </s>
<s>  and rubbing his hands together said in his
most conciliatory tone

and where should you think bill was now my dear </s>
<s> 

the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not
tell </s>
<s>  and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be
crying </s>
<s> 

and the boy too said the jew straining his eyes to catch a glimpse
of her face </s>
<s>   poor leetle child </s>
<s>   left in a ditch nance </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s> 

the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he
is than among us </s>
<s>  and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies
dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the jew in amazement </s>
<s> 

ay i do returned the girl meeting his gaze </s>
<s>   i shall be glad to
have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over </s>
<s>   i
cant bear to have him about me </s>
<s>   the sight of him turns me against
myself and all of you </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said the jew scornfully </s>
<s>   youre drunk </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s>  cried the girl bitterly </s>
<s>   its no fault of yours if i am not </s>
<s> 
youd never have me anything else if you had your will except
now </s>
<s> the humour doesnt suit you doesnt it </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  rejoined the jew furiously </s>
<s>   it does not </s>
<s> 

change it then </s>
<s>  responded the girl with a laugh </s>
<s> 

change it </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his
companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i
will change it </s>
<s>   listen to me you drab </s>
<s>   listen to me who with six
words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat
between my fingers now </s>
<s>   if he comes back and leaves the boy behind
him </s>
<s>  if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to
me </s>
<s>  murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch </s>
<s>   and
do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too
late </s>
<s> 

what is all this </s>
<s>  cried the girl involuntarily </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  pursued fagin mad with rage </s>
<s>   when the boys worth
hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way
of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could
whistle away the lives of </s>
<s>   and me bound too to a born devil that
only wants the will and has the power to to

panting for breath the old man stammered for a word </s>
<s>  and in that
instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole
demeanour </s>
<s>   a moment before his clenched hands had grasped the air </s>
<s> 
his eyes had dilated </s>
<s>  and his face grown livid with passion </s>
<s>  but now
he shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the
apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy </s>
<s>   after a
short silence he ventured to look round at his companion </s>
<s>   he appeared
somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from
which he had first roused her </s>
<s> 

nancy dear </s>
<s>  croaked the jew in his usual voice </s>
<s>   did you mind me
dear </s>
<s> 

dont worry me now fagin </s>
<s>  replied the girl raising her head
languidly </s>
<s>   if bill has not done it this time he will another </s>
<s>  he has
done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can </s>
<s>  and
when he cant he wont </s>
<s>  so no more about that </s>
<s> 

regarding this boy my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew rubbing the palms of his
hands nervously together </s>
<s> 

the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy
hastily </s>
<s>  and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way
and out of yoursthat is if bill comes to no harm </s>
<s>   and if toby got
clear off bills pretty sure to be safe </s>
<s>  for bills worth two of toby
any time </s>
<s> 

and about what i was saying my dear </s>
<s>  observed the jew keeping his
glistening eye steadily upon her </s>
<s> 

you must say it all over again if its anything you want me to do
rejoined nancy </s>
<s>  and if it is you had better wait till tomorrow </s>
<s>   you
put me up for a minute </s>
<s>  but now im stupid again </s>
<s> 

fagin put several other questions </s>
<s>  all with the same drift of
ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints </s>
<s>  but
she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his
searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a
trifle in liquor was confirmed </s>
<s>   nancy indeed was not exempt from a
failing which was very common among the jews female pupils </s>
<s>  and in
which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than
checked </s>
<s>  her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva

the justice of the jews supposition </s>

temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into
dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings </s>

influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave
utterance to various exclamations of never say die </s>

calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a
lady or gentleman was happy <abvr> fagin who had had considerable
experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction
that she was very far gone indeed </s>

having eased his mind by this discovery </s>
<s>  and having accomplished his
twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard
and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned
mr </s>
<s>  fagin again turned his face homeward </s>
<s>  leaving his young friend
asleep with her head upon the table </s>
<s> 

it was within an hour of midnight </s>
<s>   the weather being dark and
piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter </s>
<s>   the sharp wind
that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as
of dust and mud for few people were abroad and they were to all
appearance hastening fast home </s>
<s>  it blew from the right quarter for the
jew however and straight before it he went </s>
<s>  trembling and shivering
as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way </s>
<s> 

he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling
in his pocket for the doorkey when a dark figure emerged from a
projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road
glided up to him unperceived </s>
<s> 

fagin </s>
<s>  whispered a voice close to his ear </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning quickly round is that

yes </s>
<s>  interrupted the stranger </s>
<s>   i have been lingering here these two
hours </s>
<s>   where the devil have you been </s>
<s> 

on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily at his
companion and slackening his pace as he spoke </s>
<s>   on your business all
night </s>
<s> 

oh of course </s>
<s>  said the stranger with a sneer </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  and whats
come of it </s>
<s> 

nothing good said the jew </s>
<s> 

nothing bad i hope </s>
<s>  said the stranger stopping short and turning a
startled look on his companion </s>
<s> 

the jew shook his head and was about to reply when the stranger
interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this
time arrived </s>
<s>   remarking that he had better say what he had got to
say under cover </s>
<s>   for his blood was chilled with standing about so
long and the wind blew through him </s>
<s> 

fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking
home a visitor at that unseasonable hour </s>
<s>  and indeed muttered
something about having no fire </s>
<s>  but his companion repeating his request
in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to
close it softly while he got a light </s>
<s> 

its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps </s>
<s> 
make haste </s>
<s> 

shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage </s>
<s>  as he
spoke it closed with a loud noise </s>
<s> 

that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way </s>
<s>  the wind
blew it to or it shut of its own accord </s>
<s>  one or the other </s>
<s>  look sharp
with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in
this confounded hole </s>
<s> 

fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs </s>
<s>   after a short absence
he returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that toby
crackit was asleep in the back room below and that the boys were in
the front one </s>
<s>   beckoning the man to follow him he led the way
upstairs </s>
<s> 

we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the
jew throwing open a door on the first floor </s>
<s>  and as there are holes
in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours well set
the candle on the stairs </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s> 

with those words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper
flight of stairs exactly opposite to the room door </s>
<s>   this done he led
the way into the apartment </s>
<s>  which was destitute of all movables save a
broken armchair and an old couch or sofa without covering which
stood behind the door </s>
<s>   upon this piece of furniture the stranger sat
himself with the air of a weary man </s>
<s>  and the jew drawing up the
armchair opposite they sat face to face </s>
<s>   it was not quite dark </s>
<s>  the
door was partially open </s>
<s>  and the candle outside threw a feeble
reflection on the opposite wall </s>
<s> 

they conversed for some time in whispers </s>
<s>   though nothing of the
conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be
defending himself against some remarks of the stranger </s>
<s>  and that the
latter was in a state of considerable irritation </s>
<s>   they might have been
talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monksby which
name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course
of their colloquysaid raising his voice a little

i tell you again it was badly planned </s>
<s>   why not have kept him here
among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at
once </s>
<s> 

only hear him </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders </s>
<s> 

why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen </s>
<s> 
demanded monks sternly </s>
<s>   havent you done it with other boys scores
of times </s>
<s>   if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt
you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom </s>
<s>  perhaps
for life </s>
<s> 

whose turn would that have served my dear </s>
<s>  inquired the jew humbly </s>
<s> 

mine replied monks </s>
<s> 

but not mine said the jew submissively </s>
<s>   he might have become of
use to me </s>
<s>   when there are two parties to a bargain it is only
reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted </s>

good friend </s>
<s> 

what then </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew </s>
<s> 
he was not like other boys in the same circumstances </s>
<s> 

curse him no </s>
<s>  muttered the man or he would have been a thief long
ago </s>
<s> 

i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously
watching the countenance of his companion </s>
<s>   his hand was not in </s>
<s>   i
had nothing to frighten him with </s>
<s>  which we always must have in the
beginning or we labour in vain </s>
<s>   what could i do </s>
<s>   send him out with
the dodger and charley </s>
<s>   we had enough of that at first my dear </s>
<s>  i
trembled for us all </s>
<s> 

that was not my doing observed monks </s>
<s> 

no no my dear </s>
<s>  renewed the jew </s>
<s>   and i dont quarrel with it now </s>
<s> 
because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on
the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you
were looking for </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>   i got him back for you by means of the girl </s>
<s> 
and then she begins to favour him </s>
<s> 

throttle the girl </s>
<s>  said monks impatiently </s>
<s> 

why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew
smiling </s>
<s>  and besides that sort of thing is not in our way </s>
<s>  or one
of these days i might be glad to have it done </s>
<s>   i know what these
girls are monks well </s>
<s>   as soon as the boy begins to harden shell

thief </s>

<s>  interposed the other man with a look
of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands </s>
<s>   mind
that </s>
<s>   fagin </s>
<s>   i had no hand in it </s>
<s>   anything but his death i told you
from the first </s>

arms as he sprung to his feet </s>

yonder </s>
<s>  replied the man glaring at the opposite wall </s>
<s>   the shadow </s>
<s> 
i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the
wainscot like a breath </s>
<s> 

the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the room </s>
<s> 
the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been
placed </s>
<s>   it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white
faces </s>
<s>   they listened intently </s>
<s>   a profound silence reigned throughout
the house </s>
<s> 

its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his
companion </s>
<s> 

ill swear i saw it </s>
<s>  replied monks trembling </s>
<s>   it was bending
forward when i saw it first </s>
<s>  and when i spoke it darted away </s>
<s> 

the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate and
telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs </s>
<s>   they
looked into all the rooms </s>
<s>  they were cold bare and empty </s>
<s>   they
descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below </s>
<s>   the
green damp hung upon the low walls </s>
<s>  the tracks of the snail and slug
glistened in the light of the candle </s>
<s>  but all was still as death </s>
<s> 

what do you think now </s>
<s>  said the jew when they had regained the
passage </s>
<s>   besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house
except toby and the boys </s>
<s>  and theyre safe enough </s>
<s>  see here </s>
<s> 

as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket </s>
<s> 
and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them
in to prevent any intrusion on the conference </s>
<s> 

this accumulated testimony effectually staggered <abvr> monks </s>
<s>  his
protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
proceeded in their search without making any discovery </s>
<s>  and now he
gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have
been his excited imagination </s>

conversation however for that night </s>
<s>   suddenly remembering that it
was past one oclock </s>
<s>   and so the amiable couple parted </s>

chapter xxvii

atones for the unpoliteness of a former </s>

<s>  which deserted a lady
most unceremoniously

mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and
the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as
it might suit his pleasure to relieve him </s>
<s>  and as it would still less
become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming

demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their
exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at
his hands </s>
<s>   towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in
this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and
elucidative of the position that a beadle can do no wrong </s>
<s>   which
could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
rightminded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of
time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
opportunity </s>

capacity the parochial church </s>

before he began to think that it was time for <abvr> corney to return </s>
<s> 
thinking begets thinking </s>
<s>  as there were no sounds of <abvr> corneys
approach it occured to <abvr> bumble that it would be an innocent and
virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his
curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of <abvr> corneys chest
of drawers </s>
<s> 

having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was
approaching the chamber <abvr> bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded
to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers </s>
<s> 
which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture
carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with
dried lavender </s>
<s>  seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction </s>
<s>   arriving
in course of time at the righthand corner drawer in which was the
key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken
gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin <abvr> bumble
returned with a stately walk to the fireplace </s>

attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do it </s>

followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a
waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were remonstrating with
himself for being such a pleasant dog </s>

legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest </s>

he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when <abvr> corney
hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a
chair by the fireside and covering her eyes with one hand placed the
other over her heart and gasped for breath </s>

nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards </s>

matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract

accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched

the dove then turned up his coatcollar and put on his cocked hat </s>

mr </s>

<s>   a more
than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and
a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in a slight
degree intoxicated </s>
<s>  these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish

<s>  cried the robber shouting after toby
crackit who making the best use of his long legs was already ahead </s>
<s> 
stop </s>
<s> 

the repetition of the word brought toby to a dead standstill </s>
<s>  for he
was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistolshot </s>
<s> 
and sikes was in no mood to be played with </s>
<s> 

bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his
confederate </s>
<s>   come back </s>
<s> 

toby made a show of returning </s>
<s>  but ventured in a low voice broken for
want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly
along </s>
<s> 

quicker </s>
<s>  cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet and
drawing a pistol from his pocket </s>
<s>   dont play booty with me </s>
<s> 

at this moment the noise grew louder </s>
<s>   sikes again looking round
could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing
the gate of the field in which he stood </s>
<s>  and that a couple of dogs were
some paces in advance of them </s>
<s> 

its all up bill </s>
<s>  cried toby </s>
<s>  drop the kid and show em your
heels </s>
<s>   with this parting advice <abvr> crackit preferring the chance
of being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his
enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed </s>
<s>   sikes
clenched his teeth </s>
<s>  took one look around </s>
<s>  threw over the prostrate form
of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled </s>
<s>  ran along
the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those
behind from the spot where the boy lay </s>
<s>  paused for a second before
another hedge which met it at right angles </s>
<s>  and whirling his pistol
high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone </s>
<s> 

ho ho there </s>
<s>  cried a tremulous voice in the rear </s>
<s>  pincher </s>
<s> 
neptune </s>
<s>   come here come here </s>
<s> 

the dogs who in common with their masters seemed to have no
particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily
answered to the command </s>
<s>   three men who had by this time advanced some
distance into the field stopped to take counsel together </s>
<s> 

my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the
fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again </s>
<s> 

i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to <abvr> giles said a
shorter man </s>
<s>  who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very
pale in the face and very polite </s>
<s>  as frightened men frequently are </s>
<s> 

i shouldnt wish to appear illmannered gentlemen said the third
who had called the dogs back <abvr> giles ought to know </s>
<s> 

certainly replied the shorter man </s>
<s>  and whatever <abvr> giles says it
isnt our place to contradict him </s>
<s>   no no i know my sitiwation </s>
<s> 
thank my stars i know my sitiwation </s>
<s>   to tell the truth the little
man did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that
it was by no means a desirable one </s>
<s>  for his teeth chattered in his head
as he spoke </s>
<s> 

you are afraid brittles said <abvr> giles </s>
<s> 

i ant said brittles </s>
<s> 

you are said giles </s>
<s> 

youre a falsehood <abvr> giles said brittles </s>
<s> 

youre a lie brittles said <abvr> giles </s>
<s> 

now these four retorts arose from <abvr> giless taunt </s>
<s>  and <abvr> giless
taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of
going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment </s>
<s> 
the third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid </s>
<s> 

speak for yourself sir said <abvr> giles who was the palest of the
party </s>
<s> 

so i do replied the man </s>
<s>   its natural and proper to be afraid
under such circumstances </s>
<s>   i am </s>
<s> 

so am i said brittles </s>
<s>  only theres no call to tell a man he is so
bounceably </s>
<s> 

these frank admissions softened <abvr> giles who at once owned that he
was afraid </s>
<s>  upon which they all three faced about and ran back again
with the completest unanimity until <abvr> giles who had the shortest
wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely
insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech </s>
<s> 

but its wonderful said <abvr> giles when he had explained what a
man will do when his blood is up </s>
<s>   i should have committed murderi
know i shouldif wed caught one of them rascals </s>
<s> 

as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment </s>
<s>  and as
their blood like his had all gone down again </s>
<s>  some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament </s>
<s> 

i know what it was said <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  it was the gate </s>
<s> 

i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the
idea </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow
of the excitement </s>
<s>   i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was
climbing over it </s>
<s> 

by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the
same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment </s>
<s>   it was quite
obvious therefore that it was the gate </s>
<s>  especially as there was no
doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because
all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the
instant of its occurance </s>
<s> 

this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse
and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in
the pursuit </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles acted in the double capacity of butler and
steward to the old lady of the mansion </s>
<s>  brittles was a lad of allwork </s>
<s> 
who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a
promising young boy still though he was something past thirty </s>
<s> 

encouraging each other with such converse as this </s>
<s>  but keeping very
close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round
whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs </s>
<s>  the three men hurried
back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its
light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire </s>
<s>   catching up
the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot </s>
<s> 
and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the
light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like
some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was
swiftly borne </s>
<s> 

the air grew colder as day came slowly on </s>
<s>  and the mist rolled along
the ground like a dense cloud of smoke </s>
<s>   the grass was wet </s>
<s>  the
pathways and low places were all mire and water </s>
<s>  the damp breath of
an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning </s>
<s>   still
oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left
him </s>
<s> 

morning drew on apace </s>
<s>   the air become more sharp and piercing as its
first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of
dayglimmered faintly in the sky </s>
<s>   the objects which had looked dim
and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually
resolved into their familiar shapes </s>
<s>   the rain came down thick and
fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes </s>
<s>   but oliver felt
it not as it beat against him </s>
<s>  for he still lay stretched helpless
and unconscious on his bed of clay </s>
<s> 

at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed </s>
<s>  and
uttering it the boy awoke </s>
<s>   his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl
hung heavy and useless at his side </s>
<s>  the bandage was saturated with
blood </s>
<s>   he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a
sitting posture </s>
<s>  when he had done so he looked feebly round for help
and groaned with pain </s>
<s>   trembling in every joint from cold and
exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright </s>
<s>  but shuddering from
head to foot fell prostrate on the ground </s>
<s> 

after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long
plunged oliver </s>
<s>   urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which
seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die </s>
<s>   got upon
his feet and essayed to walk </s>
<s>  his head was dizzy and he staggered to
and fro like a drunken man </s>
<s>   but he kept up nevertheless and with
his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he
knew not whither </s>
<s> 

and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his
mind </s>
<s>   he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who
were angrily disputingfor the very words they said sounded in his
ears </s>
<s>  and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some
violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was
talking to them </s>
<s>  then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the
previous day </s>
<s>  and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers
grasp upon his wrist </s>
<s>  suddenly he started back at the report of
firearms </s>
<s>  there rose into the air loud cries and shouts </s>
<s>  lights
gleamed before his eyes </s>
<s>  all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand
bore him hurriedly away </s>
<s>   through all these rapid visions there ran an
undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented
him incessantly </s>
<s> 

thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars
of gates or through hedgegaps as they came in his way until he
reached a road </s>
<s>   here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused
him </s>
<s> 

he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house
which perhaps he could reach </s>
<s>   pitying his condition they might have
compassion on him </s>
<s>  and if they did not it would be better he thought
to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields </s>
<s>   he summoned
up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps
towards it </s>
<s> 

as he drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had
seen it before </s>
<s>   he remembered nothing of its details </s>
<s>  but the shape
and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him </s>
<s> 

that garden wall </s>
<s>   on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last
night and prayed the two mens mercy </s>
<s>   it was the very house they had
attempted to rob </s>
<s> 

oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that
for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of
flight </s>
<s>   flight </s>
<s>   he could scarcely stand </s>
<s>   and if he were in full
possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame
whither could he fly </s>
<s>   he pushed against the gardengate </s>
<s>  it was
unlocked and swung open on its hinges </s>
<s>   he tottered across the lawn </s>
<s> 
climbed the steps </s>
<s>  knocked faintly at the door </s>
<s>  and his whole strength
failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico </s>
<s> 

it happened that about this time <abvr> giles brittles and the tinker
were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the
night with tea and sundries in the kitchen </s>
<s>   not that it was <abvr>
giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants </s>
<s> 
towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty
affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of
his superior position in society </s>
<s>   but death fires and burglary
make all men equals </s>
<s>  so <abvr> giles sat with his legs stretched out
before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while
with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of
the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and
housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest </s>
<s> 

it was about halfpast two said <abvr> giles or i wouldnt swear that
it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and
turning round in my bed as it might be so here <abvr> giles turned
round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him
to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a noise </s>
<s> 

at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the
housemaid to shut the door </s>
<s>  who asked brittles who asked the tinker
who pretended not to hear </s>
<s> 

heerd a noise continued <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   i says at first this is
illusion </s>
<s>  and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the
noise again distinct </s>
<s> 

what sort of a noise </s>
<s>  asked the cook </s>
<s> 

a kind of a busting noise replied <abvr> giles looking round him </s>
<s> 

more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater
suggested brittles </s>
<s> 

it was when you heerd it sir rejoined <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  but at this
time it had a busting sound </s>
<s>   i turned down the clothes </s>
<s>  continued
giles rolling back the tablecloth sat up in bed </s>
<s>  and listened </s>
<s> 

the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor </s>
<s>  and drew their
chairs closer together </s>
<s> 

i heerd it now quite apparent resumed <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  somebody i
says is forcing of a door or window </s>
<s>  whats to be done </s>
<s>  ill call up
that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed </s>
<s> 
or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left
without his ever knowing it </s>
<s> 

here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the
speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face
expressive of the most unmitigated horror </s>
<s> 

i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth
and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of
bed </s>
<s>  drew on a pair of

ladies present <abvr> giles murmured the tinker </s>
<s> 

of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great
emphasis on the word </s>
<s>  seized the loaded pistol that always goes
upstairs with the platebasket </s>
<s>  and walked on tiptoes to his room </s>
<s> 
brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened </s>
<s> 

so you did observed brittles in a low voice </s>
<s> 

were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles </s>
<s>  but
dont be frightened </s>
<s> 

was he frightened </s>
<s>  asked the cook </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   he was as firmah </s>
<s>  pretty near
as firm as i was </s>
<s> 

i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the
housemaid </s>
<s> 

youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little </s>
<s> 

brittles is right said <abvr> giles nodding his head approvingly </s>
<s> 
from a woman nothing else was to be expected </s>
<s>  we being men took a
dark lantern that was standing on brittles hob and groped our way
downstairs in the pitch darkas it might be so </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes
shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he
started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried
back to his chair </s>
<s>   the cook and housemaid screamed </s>
<s> 

it was a knock said <abvr> giles assuming perfect serenity </s>
<s>  open the
door somebody </s>
<s> 

nobody moved </s>
<s> 

it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in
the morning said <abvr> giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him and looking very blank himself </s>
<s>  but the door must be opened </s>
<s>   do
you hear somebody </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles as he spoke looked at brittles </s>
<s>  but that young man being
naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that
the inquiry could not have any application to him </s>
<s>  at all events he
tendered no reply </s>
<s>  <abvr> giles directed an appealing glance at the
tinker </s>
<s>  but he had suddenly fallen asleep </s>
<s>   the women were out of the
question </s>
<s> 

if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses
said <abvr> giles after a short silence i am ready to make one </s>
<s> 

so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen
asleep </s>
<s> 

brittles capitulated on these terms </s>
<s>  and the party being somewhat
reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that
it was now broad day took their way upstairs </s>
<s>  with the dogs in front </s>
<s> 
the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear </s>
<s>   by
the advice of <abvr> giles they all talked very loud to warn any
evildisposed person outside that they were strong in numbers </s>
<s>  and by
a masterstoke of policy originating in the brain of the same
ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to
make them bark savagely </s>
<s> 

these precautions having been taken <abvr> giles held on fast by the
tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and
gave the word of command to open the door </s>
<s>   brittles obeyed </s>
<s>  the group
peeping timorously over each others shoulders beheld no more
formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and
exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their
compassion </s>
<s> 

a boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the
background </s>
<s>   whats the matter with theeh </s>
<s> whybrittleslook
heredont you know </s>
<s> 

brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver
than he uttered a loud cry </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles seizing the boy by one leg and
one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the
hall and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof </s>
<s> 

here he is </s>
<s>  bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up
the staircase </s>
<s>  heres one of the thieves maam </s>
<s>  heres a thief miss </s>
<s> 
wounded miss </s>
<s>   i shot him miss </s>
<s>  and brittles held the light </s>
<s> 

in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side
of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better </s>
<s> 

the two womenservants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that <abvr>
giles had captured a robber </s>
<s>  and the tinker busied himself in
endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be
hanged </s>
<s>   in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard
a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant </s>
<s> 

giles </s>
<s>  whispered the voice from the stairhead </s>
<s> 

im here miss replied <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   dont be frightened miss </s>
<s>  i
aint much injured </s>
<s>   he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss </s>
<s> 
i was soon too many for him </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  replied the young lady </s>
<s>  you frighten my aunt as much as the
thieves did </s>
<s>   is the poor creature much hurt </s>
<s> 

wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable
complacency </s>
<s> 

he looks as if he was agoing miss bawled brittles in the same
manner as before </s>
<s>   wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in
case he should </s>
<s> 

hush pray </s>
<s>  theres a good man </s>
<s>  rejoined the lady </s>
<s>   wait quietly
only one instant while i speak to aunt </s>
<s> 

with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped
away </s>
<s>   she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person
was to be carried carefully upstairs to <abvr> giless room </s>
<s>  and that
brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to
chertsey </s>
<s>   from which place he was to despatch with all speed a
constable and doctor </s>
<s> 

but wont you take one look at him first miss </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> giles
with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he
had skilfully brought down </s>
<s>   not one little peep miss </s>
<s> 

not now for the world replied the young lady </s>
<s>   poor fellow </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
treat him kindly giles for my sake </s>
<s> 

the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a
glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child </s>
<s>   then
bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and
solicitude of a woman </s>
<s> 



chapter xxix

has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which
oliver resorted

in a handsome room </s>
<s>   though its furniture had rather the air of
oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance </s>
<s>   there sat two ladies
at a wellspread breakfasttable </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles dressed with scrupulous
care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them </s>
<s>   he had
taken his station some halfway between the sideboard and the
breakfasttable </s>
<s>  and with his body drawn up to its full height his
head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left
leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his
left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who
laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance </s>
<s> 

of the two ladies one was well advanced in years </s>
<s>  but the highbacked
oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she </s>
<s>   dressed
with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of bygone
costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which
rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its
effect she sat in a stately manner with her hands folded on the
table before her </s>
<s>   her eyes and age had dimmed but little of their
brightness were attentively upon her young companion </s>
<s> 

the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood </s>
<s> 
at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned
in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in
such as hers </s>
<s> 

she was not past seventeen </s>
<s>   cast in so slight and exquisite a mould </s>
<s> 
so mild and gentle </s>
<s>  so pure and beautiful </s>
<s>  that earth seemed not her
element nor its rough creatures her fit companions </s>
<s>   the very
intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye and was stamped upon her
noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world </s>
<s>  and yet the
changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights
that played about the face and left no shadow there </s>
<s>  above all the
smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside
peace and happiness </s>
<s> 

she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table </s>
<s>  chancing to
raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her she playfully put
back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead </s>
<s>  and threw into
her beaming look such an expression of affection and artless
loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her </s>
<s> 

and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he </s>
<s>  asked the old
lady after a pause </s>
<s> 

an hour and twelve minutes maam replied <abvr> giles referring to a
silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon </s>
<s> 

he is always slow remarked the old lady </s>
<s> 

brittles always was a slow boy maam replied the attendant </s>
<s>  and
seeing by the bye that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of
thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a
fast one </s>
<s> 

he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady </s>
<s> 

it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other
boys said the young lady smiling </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the gardengate </s>
<s>  out
of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door </s>
<s> 
and who getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process
burst into the room and nearly overturned <abvr> giles and the
breakfasttable together </s>
<s> 

i never heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  exclaimed the fat gentleman </s>
<s>  my dear
mrs </s>
<s>  mayliebless my soulin the silence of the night tooi never
heard of such a thing </s>
<s> 

with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands
with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found
themselves </s>
<s> 

you ought to be dead </s>
<s>  positively dead with the fright said the fat
gentleman </s>
<s>   why didnt you send </s>
<s>   bless me my man should have come in
a minute </s>
<s>  and so would i </s>
<s>  and my assistant would have been delighted </s>
<s> 
or anybody im sure under such circumstances </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>   so
unexpected </s>
<s>   in the silence of the night too </s>
<s> 

the doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
been unexpected and attempted in the nighttime </s>
<s>  as if it were the
established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
business at noon and to make an appointment by post a day or two
previous </s>
<s> 

and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i

oh </s>
<s>  very much so indeed said rose interrupting him </s>
<s>  but there is
a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  to be sure replied the doctor so there is </s>
<s>   that was your
handiwork giles i understand </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles who had been feverishly putting the teacups to rights
blushed very red and said that he had had that honour </s>
<s> 

honour eh </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>  well i dont know </s>
<s>  perhaps its as
honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at
twelve paces </s>
<s>   fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a
duel giles </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was
not for the like of him to judge about that </s>
<s>  but he rather thought it
was no joke to the opposite party </s>
<s> 

gad thats true </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>   where is he </s>
<s>   show me the way </s>
<s> 
ill look in again as i come down <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   thats the little
window that he got in at eh </s>
<s>   well i couldnt have believed it </s>
<s> 

talking all the way he followed <abvr> giles upstairs </s>
<s>  and while he is
going upstairs the reader may be informed that <abvr> losberne a
surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles
round as the doctor had grown fat more from goodhumour than from
good living </s>
<s>   and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an
old bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any
explorer alive </s>
<s> 

the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had
anticipated </s>
<s>   a large flat box was fetched out of the gig </s>
<s>  and a
bedroom bell was rung very often </s>
<s>  and the servants ran up and down
stairs perpetually </s>
<s>  from which tokens it was justly concluded that
something important was going on above </s>
<s>   at length he returned </s>
<s>  and in
reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient </s>
<s>  looked very mysterious
and closed the door carefully </s>
<s> 

this is a very extraordinary thing <abvr> maylie said the doctor
standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut </s>
<s> 

he is not in danger i hope </s>
<s>  said the old lady </s>
<s> 

why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the
circumstances replied the doctor </s>
<s>  though i dont think he is </s>
<s>  have
you seen the thief </s>
<s> 

no rejoined the old lady </s>
<s> 

nor heard anything about him </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon maam interposed <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  but i was going to
tell you about him when doctor losberne came in </s>
<s> 

the fact was that <abvr> giles had not at first been able to bring his
mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy </s>
<s>   such commendations
had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of
him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes </s>
<s> 
during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief
reputation for undaunted courage </s>
<s> 

rose wished to see the man said <abvr> maylie but i wouldnt hear of
it </s>
<s> 

humph </s>
<s>  rejoined the doctor </s>
<s>   there is nothing very alarming in his
appearance </s>
<s>   have you any objection to see him in my presence </s>
<s> 

if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not </s>
<s> 

then i think it is necessary said the doctor </s>
<s>  at all events i am
quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you
postponed it </s>
<s>   he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now </s>

chapter xxx

relates what olivers new visitors thought of him

with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised
in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm
through one of his </s>
<s>  and offering his disengaged hand to <abvr> maylie
led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs </s>
<s> 

now said the doctor in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of
a bedroomdoor let us hear what you think of him </s>
<s>   he has not been
shaved very recently but he dont look at all ferocious
notwithstanding </s>
<s>   stop though </s>
<s>   let me first see that he is in
visiting order </s>
<s> 

stepping before them he looked into the room </s>
<s>   motioning them to
advance he closed the door when they had entered </s>
<s>  and gently drew back
the curtains of the bed </s>
<s>   upon it in lieu of the dogged blackvisaged
ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere child </s>
<s>   worn with
pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep </s>
<s>   his wounded arm
bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast </s>
<s>  his head reclined
upon the other arm which was half hidden by his long hair as it
streamed over the pillow </s>
<s> 

the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a
minute or so in silence </s>
<s>   whilst he was watching the patient thus the
younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the
bedside gathered olivers hair from his face </s>
<s>   as she stooped over
him her tears fell upon his forehead </s>
<s> 

the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity
and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
he had never known </s>
<s>   thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of
water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or the mention of a
familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
that never were in this life </s>
<s>  which vanish like a breath </s>
<s>  which some
brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have
awakened </s>
<s>  which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall </s>
<s> 

what can this mean </s>
<s>  exclaimed the elder lady </s>
<s>   this poor child can
never have been the pupil of robbers </s>
<s> 

vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in
many temples </s>
<s>  and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine
her </s>
<s> 

but at so early an age </s>
<s>  urged rose </s>
<s> 

my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his
head </s>
<s>  crime like death is not confined to the old and withered
alone </s>
<s>   the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims </s>
<s> 

but can youoh </s>
<s>  can you really believe that this delicate boy has
been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society </s>
<s>  said
rose </s>
<s> 

the surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared
it was very possible </s>
<s>  and observing that they might disturb the
patient led the way into an adjoining apartment </s>
<s> 

but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is </s>
<s> 
think that he may never have known a mothers love or the comfort of a
home </s>
<s>  that illusage and blows or the want of bread may have driven
him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt </s>
<s>   aunt dear aunt
for mercys sake think of this before you let them drag this sick
child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his
chances of amendment </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  as you love me and know that i have never
felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i
might have done so and might have been equally helpless and
unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too
late </s>
<s> 

my dear love said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to
her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  replied rose eagerly </s>
<s> 

no surely said the old lady </s>
<s>  my days are drawing to their close </s>
<s> 
and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others </s>
<s>  what can i do to
save him sir </s>
<s> 

let me think maam said the doctor </s>
<s>  let me think </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns
up and down the room </s>
<s>  often stopping and balancing himself on his
toes and frowning frightfully </s>
<s>   after various exclamations of ive
got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking
and frowning he at length made a dead halt and spoke as follows </s>
<s> 

i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles
and that little boy brittles i can manage it </s>
<s>   giles is a faithful
fellow and an old servant i know </s>
<s>  but you can make it up to him in a
thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides </s>
<s>   you
dont object to that </s>
<s> 

unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied <abvr>
maylie </s>
<s> 

there is no other said the doctor </s>
<s>   no other take my word for it </s>
<s> 

then my aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through
her tears </s>
<s>  but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is
indispensably necessary </s>
<s> 

you seem to think retorted the doctor that everybody is disposed
to be hardhearted today except yourself miss rose </s>
<s>  i only hope for
the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as
vulnerable and softhearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow
who appeals to your compassion </s>
<s>  and i wish i were a young fellow that
i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for
doing so as the present </s>
<s> 

you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself returned rose
blushing </s>
<s> 

well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult
matter </s>
<s>   but to return to this boy </s>
<s>   the great point of our agreement
is yet to come </s>
<s>   he will wake in an hour or so i dare say </s>
<s>  and
although i have told that thickheaded constablefellow downstairs that
he musnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may
converse with him without danger </s>
<s>   now i make this stipulationthat i
shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we
judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he
is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall
be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at
all events </s>
<s> 

oh no aunt </s>
<s>  entreated rose </s>
<s> 

oh yes aunt </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>   is is a bargain </s>
<s> 

he cannot be hardened in vice said rose </s>
<s>  it is impossible </s>
<s> 

very good retorted the doctor </s>
<s>  then so much the more reason for
acceding to my proposition </s>
<s> 

finally the treaty was entered into </s>
<s>  and the parties thereunto sat down
to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake </s>
<s> 

the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial
than <abvr> losberne had led them to expect </s>
<s>  for hour after hour passed
on and still oliver slumbered heavily </s>
<s>   it was evening indeed before
the kindhearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he was at
length sufficiently restored to be spoken to </s>
<s>   the boy was very ill he
said and weak from the loss of blood </s>
<s>  but his mind was so troubled
with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give
him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next
morning </s>
<s>  which he should otherwise have done </s>
<s> 

the conference was a long one </s>
<s>   oliver told them all his simple
history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength </s>
<s> 
it was a solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice
of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities
which hard men had brought upon him </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  if when we oppress and grind
our fellowcreatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences
of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly
it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their
aftervengeance on our heads </s>
<s>  if we heard but one instant in
imagination the deep testimony of dead mens voices which no power
can stifle and no pride shut out </s>
<s>  where would be the injury and
injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each days
life brings with it </s>
<s> 

olivers pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night </s>
<s>  and loveliness
and virtue watched him as he slept </s>
<s>   he felt calm and happy and could
have died without a murmur </s>
<s> 

the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to
rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them
for being weak all at once betook himself downstairs to open upon <abvr>
giles </s>
<s>   and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that
he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the
kitchen </s>
<s>  so into the kitchen he went </s>
<s> 

there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament
the womenservants <abvr> brittles <abvr> giles the tinker who had
received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of
the day in consideration of his services and the constable </s>
<s>   the
latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and
large halfboots </s>
<s>  and he looked as if he had been taking a
proportionate allowance of aleas indeed he had </s>
<s> 

the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion </s>
<s>  for
mr </s>
<s>  giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind when the doctor
entered </s>
<s>  <abvr> brittles with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating
everything before his superior said it </s>
<s> 

sit still </s>
<s>  said the doctor waving his hand </s>
<s> 

thank you sir said <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   misses wished some ale to be given
out sir </s>
<s>  and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir
and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here </s>
<s> 

brittles headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen
generally were understood to express the gratification they derived
from <abvr> giless condescension </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles looked round with a
patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved
properly he would never desert them </s>
<s> 

how is the patient tonight sir </s>
<s>  asked giles </s>
<s> 

soso </s>
<s>  returned the doctor </s>
<s>   i am afraid you have got yourself into
a scrape there <abvr> giles </s>
<s> 

i hope you dont mean to say sir said <abvr> giles trembling that
hes going to die </s>
<s>   if i thought it i should never be happy again </s>
<s>   i
wouldnt cut a boy off </s>
<s>   no not even brittles here </s>
<s>  not for all the
plate in the county sir </s>
<s> 

thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles are
you a protestant </s>
<s> 

yes sir i hope so faltered <abvr> giles who had turned very pale </s>
<s> 

and what are you boy </s>
<s>  said the doctor turning sharply upon
brittles </s>
<s> 

lord bless me sir </s>
<s>  replied brittles starting violently </s>
<s>  im the
same as <abvr> giles sir </s>
<s> 

then tell me this said the doctor both of you both of you </s>
<s>  are
you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is
the boy that was put through the little window last night </s>
<s>   out with
it </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   we are prepared for you </s>
<s> 

the doctor who was universally considered one of the besttempered
creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger
that giles and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and
excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction </s>
<s> 

pay attention to the reply constable will you </s>
<s>  said the doctor
shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the
bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthys
utmost acuteness </s>
<s>  something may come of this before long </s>
<s> 

the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of
office </s>
<s>  which had been reclining indolently in the chimneycorner </s>
<s> 

its a simple question of identity you will observe said the doctor </s>
<s> 

thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great
violence </s>
<s>  for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had
gone the wrong way </s>
<s> 

heres the house broken into said the doctor and a couple of men
catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke
and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness </s>
<s>   heres a boy comes
to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have
his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon himby doing which
they place his life in great dangerand swear he is the thief </s>
<s>   now
the question is whether these men are justified by the fact </s>
<s>  if not
in what situation do they place themselves </s>
<s> 

the constable nodded profoundly </s>
<s>   he said if that wasnt law he would
be glad to know what was </s>
<s> 

i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn
oaths able to identify that boy </s>
<s> 

brittles looked doubtfully at <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  <abvr> giles looked doubtfully at
brittles </s>
<s>  the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the
reply </s>
<s>  the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen </s>
<s>  the
doctor glanced keenly round </s>
<s>  when a ring was heard at the gate and at
the same moment the sound of wheels </s>
<s> 

its the runners </s>
<s>  cried brittles to all appearance much relieved </s>
<s> 

the what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn </s>
<s> 

the bow street officers sir replied brittles taking up a candle </s>
<s> 
me and <abvr> giles sent for em this morning </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the doctor </s>
<s> 

yes replied brittles </s>
<s>  i sent a message up by the coachman and i
only wonder they werent here before sir </s>
<s> 

you did did you </s>
<s>   then confound yourslow coaches down here </s>
<s>  thats
all said the doctor walking away </s>

chapter xxxi

involves a critical position

whos that </s>
<s>  inquired brittles opening the door a little way with
the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand </s>
<s> 

open the door replied a man outside </s>
<s>  its the officers from bow
street as was sent to today </s>
<s> 

much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the door to its full
width and confronted a portly man in a greatcoat </s>
<s>  who walked in
without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly
as if he lived there </s>
<s> 

just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man </s>
<s>  said
the officer </s>
<s>  hes in the gig aminding the prad </s>
<s>   have you got a
coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes </s>
<s> 

brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building
the portly man stepped back to the gardengate and helped his
companion to put up the gig </s>
<s>   while brittles lighted them in a state
of great admiration </s>
<s>   this done they returned to the house and being
shown into a parlour took off their greatcoats and hats and showed
like what they were </s>
<s> 

the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle
height aged about fifty </s>
<s>  with shiny black hair cropped pretty close </s>
<s> 
halfwhiskers a round face and sharp eyes </s>
<s>   the other was a
redheaded bony man in topboots </s>
<s>  with a rather illfavoured
countenance and a turnedup sinisterlooking nose </s>
<s> 

tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you </s>
<s>  said the
stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on
the table </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   goodevening master </s>
<s>   can i have a word or two with
you in private if you please </s>
<s> 

this was addressed to <abvr> losberne who now made his appearance </s>
<s>  that
gentleman motioning brittles to retire brought in the two ladies and
shut the door </s>
<s> 

this is the lady of the house said <abvr> losberne motioning towards
mrs </s>
<s>  maylie </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  blathers made a bow </s>
<s>   being desired to sit down he put his hat on
the floor and taking a chair motioned to duff to do the same </s>
<s>   the
latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good
society or quite so much at his ease in itone of the twoseated
himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and
the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment </s>
<s> 

now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers </s>
<s>  what
are the circumstances </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at
great length and with much circumlocution </s>
<s>   messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff
looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod </s>
<s> 

i cant say for certain till i see the work of course said
blathers </s>
<s>  but my opinion at once isi dont mind committing myself
to that extentthat this wasnt done by a yokel </s>
<s>  eh duff </s>
<s> 

certainly not replied duff </s>
<s> 

and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i
apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a
countryman </s>
<s>  said <abvr> losberne with a smile </s>
<s> 

thats it master replied blathers </s>
<s>   this is all about the robbery
is it </s>
<s> 

all replied the doctor </s>
<s> 

now what is this about this here boy that the servants are atalking
on </s>
<s>  said blathers </s>
<s> 

nothing at all replied the doctor </s>
<s>   one of the frightened servants
chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house </s>
<s>  but its nonsense </s>
<s>  sheer absurdity </s>
<s> 

wery easy disposed of if it is remarked duff </s>
<s> 

what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in
a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if
they were a pair of castanets </s>
<s>   who is the boy </s>
<s>  what account does he
give of himself </s>
<s>   where did he come from </s>
<s>  he didnt drop out of the
clouds did he master </s>
<s> 

of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two
ladies </s>
<s>   i know his whole history </s>
<s>  but we can talk about that
presently </s>
<s>   you would like first to see the place where the thieves
made their attempt i suppose </s>
<s> 

certainly rejoined <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>   we had better inspect the
premises first and examine the servants afterwards </s>
<s>  thats the usual
way of doing business </s>
<s> 

lights were then procured </s>
<s>  and messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff attended by
the native constable brittles giles and everybody else in short
went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at
the window </s>
<s>  and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in
at the window </s>
<s>  and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the
shutter with </s>
<s>  and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with </s>
<s> 
and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with </s>
<s>   this done amidst
the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of
their share in the previous nights adventures </s>
<s>  which they performed
some six times over </s>
<s>  contradicting each other in not more than one
important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the
last </s>
<s>   this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared
the room and held a long council together compared with which for
secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest
point in medicine would be mere childs play </s>
<s> 

meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
state </s>
<s>  and <abvr> maylie and rose looked on with anxious faces </s>
<s> 

upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very
rapid turns i hardly know what to do </s>
<s> 

surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to
these men will be sufficient to exonerate him </s>
<s> 

i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head </s>
<s> 
i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal
functionaries of a higher grade </s>
<s>   what is he after all they would
say </s>
<s>   a runaway </s>
<s>   judged by mere worldly considerations and
probabilities his story is a very doubtful one </s>
<s> 

you believe it surely </s>
<s>  interrupted rose </s>
<s> 

i believe it strange as it is </s>
<s>  and perhaps i may be an old fool for
doing so rejoined the doctor </s>
<s>  but i dont think it is exactly the
tale for a practical policeofficer nevertheless </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s>  demanded rose </s>
<s> 

because my pretty crossexaminer replied the doctor </s>
<s>  because
viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it </s>
<s>  he can
only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well </s>
<s> 
confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and
will take nothing for granted </s>
<s>   on his own showing you see he has
been the companion of thieves for some time past </s>
<s>  he has been carried
to a policeofficer on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket </s>
<s>  he
has been taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place
which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he
has not the remotest idea </s>
<s>   he is brought down to chertsey by men who
seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no </s>
<s>  and
is put through a window to rob a house </s>
<s>  and then just at the very
moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing
that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a
blundering dog of a halfbred butler and shoots him </s>
<s>  as if on purpose
to prevent his doing any good for himself </s>
<s>  dont you see all this </s>
<s> 

i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors
impetuosity </s>
<s>  but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the
poor child </s>
<s> 

no replied the doctor </s>
<s>  of course not </s>
<s>   bless the bright eyes of
your sex </s>
<s>   they never see whether for good or bad more than one side
of any question </s>
<s>  and that is always the one which first presents
itself to them </s>
<s> 

having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his
hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even
greater rapidity than before </s>
<s> 

the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will
occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
possession of the boys real story </s>
<s>   i am certain it will not be
believed </s>
<s>  and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the
dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will
be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan
of rescuing him from misery </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  what is to be done </s>
<s>  cried rose </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>  why did they send
for these people </s>
<s> 

why indeed </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   i would not have had them here
for the world </s>
<s> 

all i know is said <abvr> losberne at last </s>
<s>   sitting down with a kind
of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold
face </s>
<s>   the object is a good one and that must be our excuse </s>
<s>   the boy
has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be
talked to any more </s>
<s>  thats one comfort </s>
<s>   we must make the best of it </s>
<s> 
and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours </s>
<s>   come in </s>
<s> 

well master said blathers entering the room followed by his
colleague and making the door fast before he said any more </s>
<s>  this
warnt a putup thing </s>
<s> 

and what the devils a putup thing </s>
<s>  demanded the doctor impatiently </s>
<s> 

we call it a putup robbery ladies said blathers turning to them
as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors
when the servants is in it </s>
<s> 

nobody suspected them in this case said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

wery likely not maam replied blathers </s>
<s>  but they might have been
in it for all that </s>
<s> 

more likely on that wery account said duff </s>
<s> 

we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report </s>
<s> 
for the style of work is firstrate </s>
<s> 

wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an undertone </s>
<s> 

there was two of em in it continued blathers </s>
<s>  and they had a boy
with em </s>
<s>  thats plain from the size of the window </s>
<s>   thats all to be
said at present </s>
<s>   well see this lad that youve got upstairs at once
if you please </s>
<s> 

perhaps they will take something to drink first <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  said
the doctor </s>
<s>  his face brightening as if some new thought had occurred
to him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to be sure </s>
<s>  exclaimed rose eagerly </s>
<s>   you shall have it
immediately if you will </s>
<s> 

why thank you miss </s>
<s>  said blathers drawing his coatsleeve across
his mouth </s>
<s>  its dry work this sort of duty </s>
<s>   anythink thats handy
miss </s>
<s>  dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts </s>
<s> 

what shall it be </s>
<s>  asked the doctor following the young lady to the
sideboard </s>
<s> 

a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied
blathers </s>
<s>   its a cold ride from london maam </s>
<s>  and i always find that
spirits comes home warmer to the feelings </s>
<s> 

this interesting communication was addressed to <abvr> maylie who
received it very graciously </s>
<s>   while it was being conveyed to her the
doctor slipped out of the room </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>   not holding his wineglass by the stem but
grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand </s>
<s> 
and placing it in front of his chest </s>
<s>  i have seen a good many pieces
of business like this in my time ladies </s>
<s> 

that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said <abvr>
duff assisting his colleagues memory </s>
<s> 

that was something in this way warnt it </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 
that was done by conkey chickweed that was </s>
<s> 

you always gave that to him replied duff </s>
<s>   it was the family pet i
tell you </s>
<s>   conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had </s>
<s> 

get out </s>
<s>  retorted <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>  i know better </s>
<s>   do you mind that
time when conkey was robbed of his money though </s>
<s>   what a start that
was </s>
<s>   better than any novelbook i ever see </s>
<s> 

what was that </s>
<s>  inquired rose </s>
<s>   anxious to encourage any symptoms of
goodhumour in the unwelcome visitors </s>
<s> 

it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down
upon said blathers </s>
<s>   this here conkey chickweed

conkey means nosey maam interposed duff </s>
<s> 

of course the lady knows that dont she </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 
always interrupting you are partner </s>
<s>   this here conkey chickweed
miss kept a publichouse over battlebridge way and he had a cellar
where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and
badgerdrawing and that </s>
<s>  and a wery intellectual manner the sports was

at that time </s>
<s>  and one night he was robbed of three hundred and
twentyseven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom
in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye
who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the
robbery jumped slap out of window </s>
<s>   which was only a story high </s>
<s>  he
was wery quick about it </s>

<s>  for he fired a
blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  they set up a
hueandcry directly and when they came to look about em found that
conkey had hit the robber </s>
<s>  for there was traces of blood all the way
to some palings a good distance off </s>

<s>   however
he had made off with the blunt </s>
<s>  and consequently the name of <abvr>
chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other
bankrupts </s>
<s>  and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont
know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state
of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or
four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many
people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself </s>
<s>  one day
he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview
with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and
orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go
and assist <abvr> chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house </s>

i see him spyers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morning
why didnt you up and collar him </s>
<s>  says spyers </s>
<s>   i was so struck all
of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick
says the poor man </s>

<s>  for between ten and
eleven oclock at night he passed again </s>
<s>   spyers no sooner heard this
than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he
should have to stop a day or two </s>

down at one of the publichouse windows behind the little red curtain
with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moments notice </s>

smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed
roars out here he is </s>

out thieves </s>

shoots round </s>

dme </s>
<s>  says chickweed ive lost him again </s>
<s>   it was a remarkable
occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the
publichouse </s>
<s>  next morning spyers took his old place and looked out
from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his
eye till his own two eyes ached again </s>
<s>   at last he couldnt help
shutting em to ease em a minute </s>
<s>  and the very moment he did so he
hears chickweed aroaring out here he is </s>
<s>   off he starts once more
with chickweed halfway down the street ahead of him </s>
<s>  and after twice
as long a run as the yesterdays one the mans lost again </s>
<s>   this was
done once or twice more till onehalf the neighbours gave out that
mr </s>

him arterwards </s>

mad with grief </s>

what did jem spyers say </s>
<s>  inquired the doctor </s>
<s>  who had returned to the
room shortly after the commencement of the story </s>
<s> 

jem spyers resumed the officer for a long time said nothing at
all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he
understood his business </s>
<s>   but one morning he walked into the bar and
taking out his snuffbox says chickweed ive found out who done this
here robbery </s>
<s>   have you </s>
<s>  said chickweed </s>
<s>   oh my dear spyers only
let me have wengeance and i shall die contented </s>
<s>   oh my dear spyers
where is the villain </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>  said spyers offering him a pinch of
snuff none of that gammon </s>
<s>   you did it yourself </s>
<s>   so he had </s>
<s>  and a
good bit of money he had made by it too </s>
<s>  and nobody would never have
found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up
appearances </s>
<s>  said <abvr> blathers putting down his wineglass and
clinking the handcuffs together </s>
<s> 

very curious indeed observed the doctor </s>
<s>   now if you please you
can walk upstairs </s>
<s> 

if you please sir returned <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>   closely following <abvr>
losberne the two officers ascended to olivers bedroom </s>
<s>  <abvr> giles
preceding the party with a lighted candle </s>
<s> 

oliver had been dozing </s>
<s>  but looked worse and was more feverish than he
had appeared yet </s>
<s>   being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up
in bed for a minute or so </s>
<s>  and looked at the strangers without at all
understanding what was going forwardin fact without seeming to
recollect where he was or what had been passing </s>
<s> 

this said <abvr> losberne speaking softly but with great vehemence
notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a
springgun in some boyish trespass on <abvr> whatd yecallhims
grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this
morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand </s>
<s>   who has placed his
life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify </s>
<s> 

messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff looked at <abvr> giles as he was thus
recommended to their notice </s>
<s>   the bewildered butler gazed from them
towards oliver and from oliver towards <abvr> losberne with a most
ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to deny that i suppose </s>
<s>  said the doctor laying
oliver gently down again </s>
<s> 

it was all done for thefor the best sir answered giles </s>
<s>  i am
sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him </s>
<s>   i
am not of an inhuman disposition sir </s>
<s> 

thought it was what boy </s>
<s>  inquired the senior officer </s>
<s> 

the housebreakers boy sir </s>
<s>  replied giles </s>
<s>   theythey certainly
had a boy </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>   do you think so now </s>
<s>  inquired blathers </s>
<s> 

think what now </s>
<s>  replied giles looking vacantly at his questioner </s>
<s> 

think its the same boy stupidhead </s>
<s>  rejoined blathers impatiently </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s>  i really dont know said giles with a rueful
countenance </s>
<s>   i couldnt swear to him </s>
<s> 

what do you think </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 

i dont know what to think replied poor giles </s>
<s>   i dont think it is
the boy </s>
<s>  indeed im almost certain that it isnt </s>
<s>   you know it cant
be </s>
<s> 

has this man been adrinking sir </s>
<s>  inquired blathers turning to the
doctor </s>
<s> 

what a precious muddleheaded chap you are </s>
<s>  said duff addressing <abvr>
giles with supreme contempt </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short
dialogue </s>
<s>  but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked
that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would
perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittles before them </s>
<s> 

acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring
apartment where <abvr> brittles being called in involved himself and
his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light on
anything but the fact of his own strong mystification </s>
<s>  except indeed
his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put
before him that instant </s>
<s>  that he had only taken oliver to be he
because <abvr> giles had said he was </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> giles had five minutes
previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much
afraid he had been a little too hasty </s>
<s> 

among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether
mr </s>
<s>  giles had really hit anybody </s>
<s>  and upon examination of the fellow
pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more
destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper </s>
<s>  a discovery which
made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor who had
drawn the ball about ten minutes before </s>
<s>  upon no one however did it
make a greater impression than on <abvr> giles himself </s>
<s>  who after
labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a
fellowcreature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to
the utmost </s>
<s>   finally the officers without troubling themselves very
much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took
up their rest for that night in the town </s>
<s>  promising to return the next
morning </s>
<s> 

with the next morning there came a rumour that two men and a boy were
in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended over night under
suspicious circumstances </s>
<s>  and to kingston messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff
journeyed accordingly </s>
<s>  the suspicious circumstances however resolving
themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been
discovered sleeping under a haystack </s>
<s>  which although a great crime is
only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the
english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects
held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence
that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with
violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
punishment of death </s>
<s>  messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff came back again as wise
as they went </s>
<s> 

in short after some more examination and a great deal more
conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the
joint bail of <abvr> maylie and <abvr> losberne for olivers appearance if
he should ever be called upon </s>
<s>  and blathers and duff being rewarded
with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the
subject of their expedition </s>
<s>  the latter gentleman on a mature
consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that
the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet </s>
<s>  and the
former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
great <abvr> conkey chickweed </s>
<s> 

meanwhile oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care
of <abvr> maylie rose and the kindhearted <abvr> losberne </s>
<s>   if fervent
prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in
heavenand if they be not what prayers are </s>
<s> the blessings which the
orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing
peace and happiness </s>

chapter xxxii

of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends

olivers ailings were neither slight nor few </s>
<s>   in addition to the pain
and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold
had brought on fever and ague </s>
<s>   which hung about him for many weeks
and reduced him sadly </s>
<s>  but at length he began by slow degrees to
get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words
how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how
ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do
something to show his gratitude </s>
<s>  only something which would let them
see the love and duty with which his breast was full </s>
<s>  something
however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness
had not been cast away </s>
<s>  but that the poor boy whom their charity had
rescued from misery or death was eager to serve them with his whole
heart and soul </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said rose when oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale
lips </s>
<s>  you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will </s>
<s> 
we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall
accompany us </s>
<s>   the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasure and
beauties of spring will restore you in a few days </s>
<s>   we will employ you
in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble </s>
<s> 

the trouble </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  dear lady if i could but work for
you </s>
<s>  if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or
watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make
you happy </s>
<s>  what would i give to do it </s>
<s> 

you shall give nothing at all said miss maylie smiling </s>
<s>  for as i
told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways </s>
<s>  and if you only
take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make
me very happy indeed </s>
<s> 

happy maam </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>  how kind of you to say so </s>
<s> 

you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady </s>
<s> 
to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an
unspeakable pleasure to me </s>
<s>  but to know that the object of her goodness
and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence
would delight me more than you can well imagine </s>
<s>   do you understand
me </s>
<s>  she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face </s>
<s> 

oh yes maam yes </s>
<s>  replied oliver eagerly </s>
<s>  but i was thinking that
i am ungrateful now </s>
<s> 

to whom </s>
<s>  inquired the young lady </s>
<s> 

to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care
of me before rejoined oliver </s>
<s>   if they knew how happy i am they
would be pleased i am sure </s>
<s> 

i am sure they would rejoined olivers benefactress </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well
enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them </s>
<s> 

has he maam </s>
<s>  cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure </s>
<s>   i
dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once
again </s>
<s> 

in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the
fatigue of this expedition </s>
<s>   one morning he and <abvr> losberne set out
accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   when
they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a
loud exclamation </s>
<s> 

whats the matter with the boy </s>
<s>  cried the doctor as usual all in a
bustle </s>
<s>   do you see anythinghear anythingfeel anythingeh </s>
<s> 

that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window </s>
<s>  that
house </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  well what of it </s>
<s>   stop coachman </s>
<s>   pull up here cried the
doctor </s>
<s>   what of the house my man </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

the thievesthe house they took me to </s>
<s>  whispered oliver </s>
<s> 

the devil it is </s>
<s>  cried the doctor </s>
<s>   hallo there </s>
<s>  let me out </s>
<s> 

but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled
out of the coach by some means or other </s>
<s>  and running down to the
deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said a little ugly humpbacked man </s>
<s>   opening the door so
suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick
nearly fell forward into the passage </s>
<s>  whats the matter here </s>
<s> 

matter </s>
<s>  exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments
reflection </s>
<s>   a good deal </s>
<s>   robbery is the matter </s>
<s> 

therell be murder the matter too replied the humpbacked man
coolly if you dont take your hands off </s>
<s>   do you hear me </s>
<s> 

i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake </s>
<s> 

wheresconfound the fellow whats his rascally namesikes </s>
<s>  thats
it </s>
<s>   wheres sikes you thief </s>
<s> 

the humpbacked man stared as if in excess of amazement and
indignation </s>
<s>  then twisting himself dexterously from the doctors
grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the
house </s>
<s>   before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed
into the parlour without a word of parley </s>
<s> 

he looked anxiously round </s>
<s>  not an article of furniture </s>
<s>  not a vestige
of anything animate or inanimate </s>
<s>  not even the position of the
cupboards </s>
<s>  answered olivers description </s>
<s> 

now </s>
<s>  said the humpbacked man who had watched him keenly what do
you mean by coming into my house in this violent way </s>
<s>  do you want to
rob me or to murder me </s>
<s>   which is it </s>
<s> 

did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair
you ridiculous old vampire </s>
<s>  said the irritable doctor </s>
<s> 

what do you want then </s>
<s>  demanded the hunchback </s>
<s>   will you take
yourself off before i do you a mischief </s>
<s>   curse you </s>
<s> 

as soon as i think proper said <abvr> losberne looking into the other
parlour </s>
<s>  which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to
olivers account of it </s>
<s>   i shall find you out some day my friend </s>
<s> 

will you </s>
<s>  sneered the illfavoured cripple </s>
<s>   if you ever want me
im here </s>
<s>   i havent lived here mad and all alone for fiveandtwenty
years to be scared by you </s>
<s>   you shall pay for this </s>
<s>  you shall pay for
this </s>
<s>   and so saying the misshapen little demon set up a yell and
danced upon the ground as if wild with rage </s>
<s> 

stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself </s>
<s>  the boy must
have made a mistake </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>   put that in your pocket and shut yourself
up again </s>
<s>   with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money
and returned to the carriage </s>
<s> 

the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations
and curses all the way </s>
<s>  but as <abvr> losberne turned to speak to the
driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant
with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and
vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months
afterwards </s>
<s>   he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until
the driver had resumed his seat </s>
<s>  and when they were once more on their
way they could see him some distance behind </s>
<s>  beating his feet upon the
ground and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage </s>
<s> 

i am an ass </s>
<s>  said the doctor after a long silence </s>
<s>   did you know
that before oliver </s>
<s> 

no sir </s>
<s> 

then dont forget it another time </s>
<s> 

an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some
minutes </s>
<s>   even if it had been the right place and the right fellows
had been there what could i have done singlehanded </s>
<s>  and if i had had
assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my
own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i
have hushed up this business </s>
<s>  that would have served me right though </s>
<s> 
i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on
impulse </s>
<s>   it might have done me good </s>
<s> 

now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon
anything but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment
to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from
being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the
warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him </s>
<s>   if the truth must be
told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being
disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on
the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any </s>
<s>   he
soon came round again however </s>
<s>  and finding that olivers replies to
his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still
delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever
been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that
time forth </s>
<s> 

as oliver knew the name of the street in which <abvr> brownlow resided
they were enabled to drive straight thither </s>
<s>   when the coach turned
into it his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his
breath </s>
<s> 

now my boy which house is it </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> losberne </s>
<s> 

that </s>
<s>   that </s>
<s>  replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window </s>
<s> 
the white house </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s>   pray make haste </s>
<s>  i feel as if i
should die </s>
<s>  it makes me tremble so </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  you
will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and
well </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   i hope so </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>   they were so good to me </s>
<s>  so very
very good to me </s>
<s> 

the coach rolled on </s>
<s>   it stopped </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  that was the wrong house </s>
<s>  the
next door </s>
<s>   it went on a few paces and stopped again </s>
<s>  oliver looked up
at the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>  the white house was empty and there was a bill in the window </s>
<s> 
to let </s>
<s> 

knock at the next door cried <abvr> losberne taking olivers arm in
his </s>
<s>   what has become of <abvr> brownlow who used to live in the
adjoining house do you know </s>
<s> 

the servant did not know </s>
<s>  but would go and inquire </s>
<s>   she presently
returned and said that <abvr> brownlow had sold off his goods and gone
to the west indies six weeks before </s>
<s>   oliver clasped his hands and
sank feebly backward </s>
<s> 

has his housekeeper gone too </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> losberne after a moments
pause </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>
<s>  replied the servant </s>
<s>   the old gentleman the housekeeper
and a gentleman who was a friend of <abvr> brownlows all went together </s>
<s> 

then turn towards home again said <abvr> losberne to the driver </s>
<s>  and
dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded
london </s>
<s> 

the bookstall keeper sir </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>   i know the way there </s>
<s>   see
him pray sir </s>
<s>   do see him </s>
<s> 

my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day said the
doctor </s>
<s>   quite enough for both of us </s>
<s>   if we go to the bookstall
keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house
on fire or run away </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  home again straight </s>
<s>   and in obedience to
the doctors impulse home they went </s>
<s> 

this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in
the midst of his happiness </s>
<s>  for he had pleased himself many times
during his illness with thinking of all that <abvr> brownlow and <abvr>
bedwin would say to him </s>
<s>  and what delight it would be to tell them how
many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had
done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them </s>
<s>  the hope
of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he
had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many
of his recent trials </s>
<s>  and now the idea that they should have gone so
far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a
robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying
daywas almost more than he could bear </s>
<s> 

the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of
his benefactors </s>
<s>   after another fortnight when the fine warm weather
had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young
leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house
at chertsey for some months </s>
<s> 

sending the plate which had so excited fagins cupidity to the
bankers </s>
<s>  and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took
oliver with them </s>
<s> 

who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft
tranquillity the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green
hills and rich woods of an inland village </s>
<s>   who can tell how scenes of
peace and quietude sink into the minds of painworn dwellers in close
and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded
hearts </s>
<s>   men who have lived in crowded pentup streets through lives
of toil and who have never wished for change </s>
<s>  men to whom custom has
indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick
and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks </s>
<s>  even
they with the hand of death upon them have been known to yearn at
last for one short glimpse of natures face </s>
<s>  and carried far from the
scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once
into a new state of being </s>
<s>   crawling forth from day to day to some
green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by
the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a
foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they
have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they
watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before faded
from their dim and feeble sight </s>
<s>   the memories which peaceful country
scenes call up are not of this world nor of its thoughts and hopes </s>
<s> 
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the
graves of those we loved </s>
<s>   may purify our thoughts and bear down
before it old enmity and hatred </s>
<s>  but beneath all this there lingers
in the least reflective mind a vague and halfformed consciousness of
having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time
which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down
pride and worldliness beneath it </s>
<s> 

it was a lovely spot to which they repaired </s>
<s>   oliver whose days had
been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and
brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there </s>
<s>   the rose and
honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls </s>
<s>  the ivy crept round the trunks
of the trees </s>
<s>  and the gardenflowers perfumed the air with delicious
odours </s>
<s>   hard by was a little churchyard </s>
<s>  not crowded with tall
unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh
turf and moss </s>
<s>  beneath which the old people of the village lay at
rest </s>
<s>   oliver often wandered here </s>
<s>  and thinking of the wretched grave
in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen </s>
<s> 
but when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead he would cease
to think of her as lying in the ground and would weep for her sadly
but without pain </s>
<s> 

it was a happy time </s>
<s>   the days were peaceful and serene </s>
<s>  the nights
brought with them neither fear nor care </s>
<s>  no languishing in a wretched
prison or associating with wretched men </s>
<s>  nothing but pleasant and
happy thoughts </s>
<s>   every morning he went to a whiteheaded old gentleman
who lived near the little church </s>
<s>  who taught him to read better and to
write </s>
<s>   and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could
never try enough to please him </s>
<s>   then he would walk with <abvr> maylie
and rose and hear them talk of books </s>
<s>  or perhaps sit near them in
some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read </s>
<s>  which he could
have done until it grew too dark to see the letters </s>
<s>  then he had his
own lesson for the next day to prepare </s>
<s>  and at this he would work
hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came
slowly on when the ladies would walk out again and he with them </s>
<s> 
listening with such pleasure to all they said </s>
<s>   and so happy if they
wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything
he could run to fetch </s>
<s>  that he could never be quick enough about it </s>
<s> 
when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would
sit down to the piano and play some pleasant air or sing in a low
and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear </s>
<s> 
there would be no candles lighted at such times as these </s>
<s>  and oliver
would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music in a
perfect rapture </s>
<s> 

and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from any way
in which he had ever spent it yet </s>
<s>  and how happily too </s>
<s>  like all the
other days in that most happy time </s>
<s>   there was the little church in
the morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows </s>
<s>   the
birds singing without </s>
<s>   and the sweetsmelling air stealing in at the
low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance </s>
<s>  the poor
people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that
it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there
together </s>
<s>  and though the singing might be rude it was real and
sounded more musical to olivers ears at least than any he had ever
heard in church before </s>
<s>   then there were the walks as usual and many
calls at the clean houses of the labouring men </s>
<s>  and at night oliver
read a </s>
<s> or two from the bible which he had been studying all
the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and
pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself </s>
<s> 

in the morning oliver would be afoot by six oclock roaming the
fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild
flowers with which he would return laden home </s>
<s>  and which it took
great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the
embellishment of the breakfasttable </s>
<s>  there was fresh groundsel too
for miss maylies birds with which oliver who had been studying the
subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the
cages in the most approved taste </s>
<s>  when the birds were made all spruce
and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of
charity to execute in the village </s>
<s>  or failing that there was rare
cricketplaying sometimes on the green </s>
<s>  or failing that there was
always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which
oliver who had studied this science also under the same master who
was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty goodwill until
miss rose made her appearance </s>
<s>   when there were a thousand
commendations to be bestowed on all he had done </s>
<s> 

so three months glided away </s>
<s>  three months which in the life of the
most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been unmingled
happiness and which in olivers were true felicity </s>
<s>  with the purest
and most amiable generosity on one side </s>
<s>  and the truest warmest
soulfelt gratitude on the other </s>
<s>  it is no wonder that by the end of
that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with
the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his
young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment
to himself </s>

chapter xxxiii

wherein the happiness of oliver and his friends experiences a sudden
check

spring flew swiftly by and summer came </s>
<s>   if the village had been
beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
richness </s>
<s>   the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the
earlier months had now burst into strong life and health </s>
<s>  and
stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground converted
open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant
shade from which to look upon the wide prospect steeped in sunshine
which lay stretched beyond </s>
<s>   the earth had donned her mantle of
brightest green </s>
<s>  and shed her richest perfumes abroad </s>
<s>   it was the
prime and vigour of the year </s>
<s>  all things were glad and flourishing </s>
<s> 

still the same quiet life went on at the little cottage and the same
cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates </s>
<s>   oliver had long since
grown stout and healthy </s>
<s>  but health or sickness made no difference in
his warm feelings of a great many people </s>
<s>   he was still the same
gentle attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and
suffering had wasted his strength and when he was dependent for every
slight attention and comfort on those who tended him </s>
<s> 

one beautiful night when they had taken a longer walk than was
customary with them </s>
<s>   for the day had been unusually warm and there
was a brilliant moon and a light wind had sprung up which was
unusually refreshing </s>
<s>   rose had been in high spirits too and they had
walked on in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their
ordinary bounds </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie being fatigued they returned more slowly
home </s>
<s>   the young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet sat down
to the piano as usual </s>
<s>   after running abstractedly over the keys for a
few minutes she fell into a low and very solemn air </s>
<s>  and as she played
it they heard a sound as if she were weeping </s>
<s> 

rose my dear </s>
<s>  said the elder lady </s>
<s> 

rose made no reply but played a little quicker as though the words
had roused her from some painful thoughts </s>
<s> 

rose my love </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> maylie rising hastily and bending over
her </s>
<s>   what is this </s>
<s>   in tears </s>
<s>   my dear child what distresses you </s>
<s> 

nothing aunt </s>
<s>  nothing replied the young lady </s>
<s>   i dont know what
it is </s>
<s>  i cant describe it </s>
<s>  but i feel

not ill my love </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>   oh not ill </s>
<s>  replied rose </s>
<s>  shuddering as though some deadly
chillness were passing over her while she spoke </s>
<s>  i shall be better
presently </s>
<s>   close the window pray </s>
<s> 

oliver hastened to comply with her request </s>
<s>   the young lady making an
effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune </s>
<s> 
but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys </s>
<s>  covering her face with
her hands she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the tears which she
was now unable to repress </s>
<s> 

my child </s>
<s>  said the elderly lady folding her arms about her i never
saw you so before </s>
<s> 

i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose </s>
<s>  but indeed
i have tried very hard and cannot help this </s>
<s>  i fear i am ill aunt </s>
<s> 

she was indeed </s>
<s>  for when candles were brought they saw that in the
very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of
her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness </s>
<s>  its expression had
lost nothing of its beauty </s>
<s>  but it was changed </s>
<s>  and there was an
anxious haggard look about the gentle face which it had never worn
before </s>
<s>   another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush </s>
<s>   and
a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye </s>
<s>   again this disappeared
like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud </s>
<s>  and she was once more deadly
pale </s>
<s> 

oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was
alarmed by these appearances </s>
<s>  and so in truth was he </s>
<s>  but seeing that
she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and
they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to
retire for the night she was in better spirits </s>
<s>  and appeared even in
better health </s>
<s>   assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in
the morning quite well </s>
<s> 

i hope said oliver when <abvr> maylie returned that nothing is the
matter </s>
<s>   she dont look well tonight but

the old lady motioned to him not to speak </s>
<s>  and sitting herself down in
a dark corner of the room remained silent for some time </s>
<s>  at length
she said in a trembling voice </s>
<s> 

i hope not oliver </s>
<s>   i have been very happy with her for some years </s>
<s> 
too happy perhaps </s>
<s>   it may be time that i should meet with some
misfortune </s>
<s>  but i hope it is not this </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

the heavy blow said the old lady of losing the dear girl who has
so long been my comfort and happiness </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   god forbid </s>
<s>  exclaimed oliver hastily </s>
<s> 

amen to that my child </s>
<s>  said the old lady wringing her hands </s>
<s> 

surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  two
hours ago she was quite well </s>
<s> 

she is very ill now rejoined <abvr> maylies </s>
<s>  and will be worse i am
sure </s>
<s>   my dear dear rose </s>
<s>   oh what shall i do without her </s>
<s> 

she gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own
emotion ventured to remonstrate with her </s>
<s>  and to beg earnestly that
for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm </s>
<s> 

and consider maam said oliver as the tears forced themselves into
his eyes despite of his efforts to the contrary </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  consider how
young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all
about her </s>
<s>   i am surecertainquite certainthat for your sake who
are so good yourself </s>
<s>  and for her own </s>
<s>  and for the sake of all she
makes so happy </s>
<s>  she will not die </s>
<s>   heaven will never let her die so
young </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said <abvr> maylie laying her hand on olivers head </s>
<s>  you think
like a child poor boy </s>
<s>   but you teach me my duty notwithstanding </s>
<s>   i
had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned
for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
agony of separation from the objects of our love </s>
<s>   i have seen enough
too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared
to those that love them </s>
<s>  but this should give us comfort in our sorrow </s>
<s> 
for heaven is just </s>
<s>  and such things teach us impressively that there
is a brighter world than this </s>
<s>  and that the passage to it is speedy </s>
<s> 
gods will be done </s>
<s>   i love her </s>
<s>  and he knows how well </s>
<s> 

oliver was surprised to see that as <abvr> maylie said these words she
checked her lamentations as though by one effort </s>
<s>  and drawing herself
up as she spoke became composed and firm </s>
<s>   he was still more
astonished to find that this firmness lasted </s>
<s>  and that under all the
care and watching which ensued <abvr> maylie was ever ready and
collected </s>
<s>  performing all the duties which had devolved upon her
steadily and to all external appearances even cheerfully </s>
<s>   but he
was young and did not know what strong minds are capable of under
trying circumstances </s>
<s>   how should he when their possessors so seldom
know themselves </s>
<s> 

an anxious night ensued </s>
<s>   when morning came <abvr> maylies predictions
were but too well verified </s>
<s>   rose was in the first stage of a high and
dangerous fever </s>
<s> 

we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said
mrs </s>
<s>  maylie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into
his face </s>
<s>  this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to
mr </s>
<s>  losberne </s>
<s>   it must be carried to the markettown </s>
<s>  which is not more
than four miles off by the footpath across the field </s>
<s>   and thence
dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey </s>
<s>  the
people at the inn will undertake to do this </s>
<s>  and i can trust to you to
see it done i know </s>
<s> 

oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once </s>
<s> 

here is another letter said <abvr> maylie pausing to reflect </s>
<s>  but
whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i
scarcely know </s>
<s>   i would not forward it unless i feared the worst </s>
<s> 

is it for chertsey too maam </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s>  impatient to execute
his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter </s>
<s> 

no replied the old lady giving it to him mechanically </s>
<s>  oliver
glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry maylie esquire
at some great lords house in the country </s>
<s>  where he could not make out </s>
<s> 

shall it go maam </s>
<s>  asked oliver looking up impatiently </s>
<s> 

i think not replied <abvr> maylie taking it back </s>
<s>   i will wait until
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off
without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster </s>
<s> 

swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which
sometimes divided them </s>
<s>  now almost hidden by the high corn on either
side and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers
were busy at their work </s>
<s>   nor did he stop once save now and then for
a few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and
covered with dust on the little marketplace of the markettown </s>
<s> 

here he paused and looked about for the inn </s>
<s>   there were a white bank
and a red brewery and a yellow townhall </s>
<s>  and in one corner there was
a large house with all the wood about it painted green </s>
<s>   before which
was the sign of the george </s>
<s>   to this he hastened as soon as it
caught his eye </s>
<s> 

he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway </s>
<s>  and who after
hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler </s>
<s>  who after hearing
all he had to say again referred him to the landlord </s>
<s>  who was a tall
gentleman in a blue neckcloth a white hat drab breeches and boots
with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stabledoor picking
his teeth with a silver toothpick </s>
<s> 

this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out
the bill </s>
<s>   which took a long time making out </s>
<s>   and after it was ready
and paid a horse had to be saddled and a man to be dressed which
took up ten good minutes more </s>
<s>   meanwhile oliver was in such a
desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could
have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to
the next stage </s>
<s>   at length all was ready </s>
<s>  and the little parcel having
been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy
delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven
paving of the marketplace was out of the town and galloping along
the turnpikeroad in a couple of minutes </s>
<s> 

as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and
that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the innyard with a
somewhat lighter heart </s>
<s>   he was turning out of the gateway when he
accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak who was at
that moment coming out of the inn door </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly
recoiling </s>
<s>   what the devils this </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon sir said oliver </s>
<s>  i was in a great hurry to get
home and didnt see you were coming </s>
<s> 

death </s>
<s>  muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large
dark eyes </s>
<s>   who would have thought it </s>
<s>  grind him to ashes </s>
<s>  hed start
up from a stone coffin to come in my way </s>
<s> 

i am sorry stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild
look </s>
<s>   i hope i have not hurt you </s>
<s> 

rot you </s>
<s>  murmured the man in a horrible passion </s>
<s>  between his
clenched teeth </s>
<s>  if i had only had the courage to say the word i might
have been free of you in a night </s>
<s>   curses on your head and black death
on your heart you imp </s>
<s>   what are you doing here </s>
<s> 

the man shook his fist as he uttered these words incoherently </s>
<s>  he
advanced towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at
him but fell violently on the ground </s>
<s>   writhing and foaming in a fit </s>
<s> 

oliver gazed for a moment at the struggles of the madman for such he
supposed him to be </s>
<s>  and then darted into the house for help </s>
<s>   having
seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards
running as fast as he could to make up for lost time </s>
<s>   and recalling
with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary
behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted </s>
<s> 

the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however </s>
<s>  for
when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and
to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory </s>
<s> 

rose maylie had rapidly grown worse </s>
<s>  before midnight she was
delirious </s>
<s>   a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in
constant attendance upon her </s>
<s>  and after first seeing the patient he
had taken <abvr> maylie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a
most alarming nature </s>
<s>  in fact he said it would be little short of
a miracle if she recovered </s>
<s> 

how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out
with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest
sound from the sick chamber </s>
<s>   how often did a tremble shake his frame
and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling
of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had
even then occurred </s>
<s>   and what had been the fervency of all the prayers
he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the
agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the
gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by
while the life of one we dearly love is trembling in the balance </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s> 
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heart beat
violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they
conjure up before it </s>
<s>  the desperate anxiety to be doing something to
relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to
alleviate </s>
<s>  the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of
our helplessness produces </s>
<s>  what tortures can equal these </s>
<s>  what
reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the time
allay them </s>
<s> 

morning came </s>
<s>  and the little cottage was lonely and still </s>
<s>  people spoke
in whispers </s>
<s>  anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time </s>
<s> 
women and children went away in tears </s>
<s>  all the livelong day and for
hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the
garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and
shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay
stretched inside </s>
<s>   late that night <abvr> losberne arrived </s>
<s>   it is
hard said the good doctor turning away as he spoke </s>
<s>  so young </s>
<s>  so
much beloved </s>
<s>  but there is very little hope </s>
<s> 

another morning </s>
<s>   the sun shone brightly </s>
<s>  as brightly as if it looked
upon no misery or care </s>
<s>  and with every leaf and flower in full bloom
about her </s>
<s>  with life and health and sounds and sights of joy
surrounding her on every side </s>
<s>  the fair young creature lay wasting
fast </s>
<s>   oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one
of the green mounds wept and prayed for her in silence </s>
<s> 

there was such peace and beauty in the scene </s>
<s>  so much of brightness and
mirth in the sunny landscape </s>
<s>  such blithesome music in the songs of the
summer birds </s>
<s>  such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering
overhead </s>
<s>  so much of life and joyousness in all </s>
<s>  that when the boy
raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively
occurred to him that this was not a time for death </s>
<s>  that rose could
surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay </s>
<s>  that
graves were for cold and cheerless winter </s>
<s>   not for sunlight and
fragrance </s>
<s>  he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
shrunken </s>
<s>  and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in
their ghastly folds </s>
<s> 

a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts </s>
<s> 
another </s>
<s>   again </s>
<s>   it was tolling for the funeral service </s>
<s>   a group of
humble mourners entered the gate </s>
<s>  wearing white favours </s>
<s>  for the corpse
was young </s>
<s>   they stood uncovered by a grave </s>
<s>  and there was a mothera
mother onceamong the weeping train </s>
<s>   but the sun shone brightly and
the birds sang on </s>
<s> 

oliver turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received
from the young lady and wishing that the time could come again that
he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was </s>
<s>   he
had no cause for selfreproach on the score of neglect or want of
thought for he had been devoted to her service </s>
<s>  and yet a hundred
little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have
been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been </s>
<s>   we need
be careful how we deal with those about us when every death carries to
some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so
little doneof so many things forgotten and so many more which might
have been repaired </s>
<s>   there is no remorse so deep as that which is
unavailing </s>
<s>  if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this
in time </s>
<s> 

when he reached home <abvr> maylie was sitting in the little parlour </s>
<s> 
olivers heart sank at sight of her </s>
<s>  for she had never left the bedside
of her niece </s>
<s>  and he trembled to think what change could have driven
her away </s>
<s>   he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which
she would waken either to recovery and life or to bid them farewell
and die </s>
<s> 

they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours </s>
<s>   the untasted meal
was removed with looks which showed that their thoughts were
elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at
length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his
departure </s>
<s>   their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep </s>
<s>   they both involuntarily darted to the door as <abvr> losberne
entered </s>
<s> 

what of rose </s>
<s>  cried the old lady </s>
<s>   tell me at once </s>
<s>   i can bear it </s>
<s> 
anything but suspense </s>
<s>   oh tell me </s>
<s>  in the name of heaven </s>
<s> 

you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her </s>
<s>  be calm
my dear maam pray </s>
<s> 

let me go in gods name </s>
<s>   my dear child </s>
<s>   she is dead </s>
<s>  she is dying </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  cried the doctor passionately </s>
<s>   as he is good and merciful she
will live to bless us all for years to come </s>
<s> 

the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together </s>
<s>  but
the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her
first thanksgiving </s>
<s>  and she sank into the friendly arms which were
extended to receive her </s>
<s> 



chapter xxxiv

contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman
who now arrives upon the scene </s>
<s>  and a new adventure which happened to
oliver

it was almost too much happiness to bear </s>
<s>   oliver felt stunned and
stupefied by the unexpected intelligence </s>
<s>  he could not weep or speak
or rest </s>
<s>   he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of
tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a
full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast </s>
<s> 

the night was fast closing in when he returned homeward </s>
<s>   laden with
flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of
the sick chamber </s>
<s>   as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind
him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace </s>
<s>   looking
round he saw that it was a postchaise driven at great speed </s>
<s>  and as
the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning
against a gate until it should have passed him </s>
<s> 

as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap
whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that
he could not identify the person </s>
<s>   in another second or two the
nightcap was thrust out of the chaisewindow and a stentorian voice
bellowed to the driver to stop </s>
<s>   which he did as soon as he could pull
up his horses </s>
<s>   then the nightcap once again appeared </s>
<s>  and the same
voice called oliver by his name </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s>  cried the voice </s>
<s>   oliver whats the news </s>
<s>   miss rose </s>
<s>  master
oliver </s>
<s> 

is it you giles </s>
<s>  cried oliver running up to the chaisedoor </s>
<s> 

giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply
when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news </s>
<s> 

in a word </s>
<s>  cried the gentleman better or worse </s>
<s> 

bettermuch better </s>
<s>  replied oliver hastily </s>
<s> 

thank heaven </s>
<s>  exclaimed the gentleman </s>
<s>   you are sure </s>
<s> 

quite sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   the change took place only a few hours
ago </s>
<s>  and <abvr> losberne says that all danger is at an end </s>
<s> 

the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaisedoor
leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside </s>
<s> 

you are quite certain </s>
<s>   there is no possibility of any mistake on your
part my boy is there </s>
<s>  demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice </s>
<s> 
do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled </s>
<s> 

i would not for the world sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   indeed you may
believe me </s>
<s>   <abvr> losbernes words were that she would live to bless us
all for many years to come </s>
<s>   i heard him say so </s>
<s> 

the tears stood in olivers eyes as he recalled the scene which was the
beginning of so much happiness </s>
<s>  and the gentleman turned his face away
and remained silent for some minutes </s>
<s>   oliver thought he heard him
sob more than once </s>
<s>  but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh
remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood
apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay </s>
<s> 

all this time <abvr> giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting
on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and
wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pockethandkerchief dotted with
white spots </s>
<s>   that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was
abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the
young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him </s>
<s> 

i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles
said he </s>
<s>   i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time
before i see her </s>
<s>   you can say i am coming </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon <abvr> harry said giles </s>
<s>   giving a final polish to
his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief </s>
<s>  but if you would leave
the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you </s>
<s>   it
wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir </s>
<s>  i should
never have any more authority with them if they did </s>
<s> 

well rejoined harry maylie smiling you can do as you like </s>
<s>  let
him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us </s>
<s> 
only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering
or we shall be taken for madmen </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and
pocketed his nightcap </s>
<s>  and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape
which he took out of the chaise </s>
<s>   this done the postboy drove off </s>
<s> 
giles <abvr> maylie and oliver followed at their leisure </s>
<s> 

as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much
interest and curiosity at the new comer </s>
<s>   he seemed about
fiveandtwenty years of age and was of the middle height </s>
<s>  his
countenance was frank and handsome </s>
<s>  and his demeanor easy and
prepossessing </s>
<s>   notwithstanding the difference between youth and age
he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have
had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not
already spoken of her as his mother </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>

the cottage </s>
<s>   the meeting did not take place without great emotion on
both sides </s>
<s> 

mother </s>
<s>  whispered the young man </s>
<s>  why did you not write before </s>
<s> 

i did replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  but on reflection i determined to keep
back the letter until i had heard <abvr> losbernes opinion </s>
<s> 

but why said the young man why run the chance of that occurring
which so nearly happened </s>
<s>   if rose hadi cannot utter that word
nowif this illness had terminated differently how could you ever
have forgiven yourself </s>
<s>   how could i ever have know happiness again </s>
<s> 

if that had been the case harry said <abvr> maylie i fear your
happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival
here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little
import </s>
<s> 

and who can wonder if it be so mother </s>
<s>  rejoined the young man </s>
<s>  or
why should i say if </s>
<s> it isit isyou know it motheryou must
know it </s>
<s> 

i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
offer said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  i know that the devotion and affection of
her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and
lasting </s>
<s>   if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed
behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my
task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the
strict line of duty </s>
<s> 

this is unkind mother said harry </s>
<s>   do you still suppose that i am
a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own
soul </s>
<s> 

i think my dear son returned <abvr> maylie laying her hand upon his
shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last </s>
<s>  and
that among them are some which being gratified become only the more
fleeting </s>
<s>   above all i think said the lady fixing her eyes on her
sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a
wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no
fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and
upon his children also </s>
<s>  and in exact proportion to his success in the
world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against
him </s>
<s>   he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day
repent of the connection he formed in early life </s>
<s>   and she may have the
pain of knowing that he does so </s>
<s> 

mother said the young man impatiently he would be a selfish
brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe
who acted thus </s>
<s> 

you think so now harry replied his mother </s>
<s> 

and ever will </s>
<s>  said the young man </s>
<s>   the mental agony i have
suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of
a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i
have lightly formed </s>
<s>   on rose sweet gentle girl </s>
<s>  my heart is set as
firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman </s>
<s>   i have no thought no
view no hope in life beyond her </s>
<s>  and if you oppose me in this great
stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to
the wind </s>
<s>   mother think better of this and of me and do not
disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little </s>
<s> 

harry said <abvr> maylie it is because i think so much of warm and
sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded </s>
<s>  but we
have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now </s>
<s> 

let it rest with rose then interposed harry </s>
<s>   you will not press
these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle
in my way </s>
<s> 

i will not rejoined <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  but i would have you consider

i have considered </s>
<s>  was the impatient reply </s>
<s>  mother i have
considered years and years </s>
<s>   i have considered ever since i have been
capable of serious reflection </s>
<s>   my feelings remain unchanged as they
ever will </s>
<s>  and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them
vent which can be productive of no earthly good </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   before i leave
this place rose shall hear me </s>
<s> 

she shall said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she
will hear me coldly mother said the young man </s>
<s> 

not coldly rejoined the old lady </s>
<s>  far from it </s>
<s> 

how then </s>
<s>  urged the young man </s>
<s>   she has formed no other attachment </s>
<s> 

no indeed replied his mother </s>
<s>  you have or i mistake too strong a
hold on her affections already </s>
<s>   what i would say resumed the old
lady stopping her son as he was about to speak is this </s>
<s>   before you
stake your all on this chance </s>
<s>  before you suffer yourself to be carried
to the highest point of hope </s>
<s>  reflect for a few moments my dear child
on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her
doubtful birth may have on her decision </s>
<s>   devoted as she is to us with
all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of
self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her
characteristic </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s> 

that i leave you to discover replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   i must go back
to her </s>
<s>   god bless you </s>
<s> 

i shall see you again tonight </s>
<s>  said the young man eagerly </s>
<s> 

by and by replied the lady </s>
<s>  when i leave rose </s>
<s> 

you will tell her i am here </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s> 

of course replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how
i long to see her </s>
<s>   you will not refuse to do this mother </s>
<s> 

no said the old lady </s>
<s>  i will tell her all </s>
<s>   and pressing her sons
hand affectionately she hastened from the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment
while this hurried conversation was proceeding </s>
<s>   the former now held
out his hand to harry maylie </s>
<s>  and hearty salutations were exchanged
between them </s>
<s>   the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious
questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients
situation </s>
<s>  which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as
olivers statement had encouraged him to hope </s>
<s>  and to the whole of
which <abvr> giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened
with greedy ears </s>
<s> 

have you shot anything particular lately giles </s>
<s>  inquired the
doctor when he had concluded </s>
<s> 

nothing particular sir replied <abvr> giles colouring up to the eyes </s>
<s> 

nor catching any thieves nor identifying any housebreakers </s>
<s>  said
the doctor </s>
<s> 

none at all sir replied <abvr> giles with much gravity </s>
<s> 

well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that
sort of thing admirably </s>
<s>   pray how is brittles </s>
<s> 

the boy is very well sir said <abvr> giles recovering his usual tone
of patronage </s>
<s>  and sends his respectful duty sir </s>
<s> 

thats well said the doctor </s>
<s>   seeing you here reminds me <abvr>
giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so
hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small
commission in your favour </s>
<s>   just step into this corner a moment will
you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder
and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on
the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with
steps of unusual stateliness </s>
<s>   the subject matter of this conference
was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily
enlightened concerning it </s>
<s>  for <abvr> giles walked straight thither and
having called for a mug of ale announced with an air of majesty
which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in
consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that
attempted robbery to deposit in the local savingsbank the sum of
fiveandtwenty pounds for his sole use and benefit </s>
<s>   at this the two
womenservants lifted up their hands and eyes and supposed that <abvr>
giles pulling out his shirtfrill replied no no </s>
<s>  and that if they
observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank
them to tell him so </s>
<s>   and then he made a great many other remarks no
less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal
favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the
purpose as the remarks of great men commonly are </s>
<s> 

above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away </s>
<s>  for
the doctor was in high spirits </s>
<s>  and however fatigued or thoughtful
harry maylie might have been at first he was not proof against the
worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great
variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of
small jokes which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had
ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately </s>
<s>  to the evident
satisfaction of the doctor who laughed immoderately at himself and
made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy </s>
<s> 
so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they
could well have been </s>
<s>  and it was late before they retired with light
and thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and
suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need </s>
<s> 

oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual
occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many
days </s>
<s>   the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places </s>
<s> 
and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more
gathered to gladden rose with their beauty </s>
<s>  the melancholy which had
seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over
every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic </s>
<s>   the dew
seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves </s>
<s>  the air to rustle
among them with a sweeter music </s>
<s>  and the sky itself to look more blue
and bright </s>
<s>  such is the influence which the condition of our own
thoughts exercise even over the appearance of external objects </s>
<s>   men
who look on nature and their fellowmen and cry that all is dark and
gloomy are in the right </s>
<s>  but the sombre colours are reflections from
their own jaundiced eyes and hearts </s>
<s>   the real hues are delicate and
need a clearer vision </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time
that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone </s>
<s>  harry maylie
after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home was
seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in
their arrangement as left his young companion far behind </s>
<s>   if oliver
were behindhand in these respects he knew where the best were to be
found </s>
<s>  and morning after morning they scoured the country together and
brought home the fairest that blossomed </s>
<s>   the window of the young
ladys chamber was opened now </s>
<s>  for she loved to feel the rich summer
air stream in and revive her with its freshness </s>
<s>  but there always
stood in water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch
which was made up with great care every morning </s>
<s>   oliver could not
help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away
although the little vase was regularly replenished </s>
<s>  nor could he help
observing that whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably
cast his eyes up to that particular corner and nodded his head most
expressively as he set forth on his mornings walk </s>
<s>   pending these
observations the days were flying by </s>
<s>  and rose was rapidly recovering </s>
<s> 

nor did olivers time hang heavy on his hands although the young lady
had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now
and then for a short distance with <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  he applied himself
with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the whiteheaded old
gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even
himself </s>
<s>   it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was
greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence </s>
<s> 

the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his
books was on the groundfloor at the back of the house </s>
<s>   it was quite
a cottageroom with a latticewindow </s>
<s>  around which were clusters of
jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the
place with their delicious perfume </s>
<s>   it looked into a garden whence a
wicketgate opened into a small paddock </s>
<s>  all beyond was fine
meadowland and wood </s>
<s>   there was no other dwelling near in that
direction </s>
<s>  and the prospect it commanded was very extensive </s>
<s> 

one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning
to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his
books </s>
<s>   he had been poring over them for some time </s>
<s>  and as the day had
been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is
no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say
that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep </s>
<s> 

there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it
holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things
about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure </s>
<s>   so far as an
overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called
sleep this is it </s>
<s>  and yet we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us and if we dream at such a time words which are
really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate
themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and
imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
matter of impossibility to separate the two </s>
<s>   nor is this the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state </s>
<s>   it is an undoubted
fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead
yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before
us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent
presence of some external object </s>
<s>  which may not have been near us when
we closed our eyes </s>
<s>   and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
consciousness </s>
<s> 

oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room </s>
<s>  that
his books were lying on the table before him </s>
<s>  that the sweet air was
stirring among the creeping plants outside </s>
<s>   and yet he was asleep </s>
<s> 
suddenly the scene changed </s>
<s>  the air became close and confined </s>
<s>  and he
thought with a glow of terror that he was in the jews house again </s>
<s> 
there sat the hideous old man in his accustomed corner pointing at
him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat
beside him </s>
<s> 

hush my dear </s>
<s>  he thought he heard the jew say </s>
<s>  it is he sure
enough </s>
<s>   come away </s>
<s> 

he </s>
<s>  the other man seemed to answer </s>
<s>  could i mistake him think you </s>
<s> 
if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and
he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to
point him out </s>
<s>   if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across
his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that
he lay buried there </s>
<s> 

the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver
awoke with the fear and started up </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>   what was that which sent the blood tingling to his
heart and deprived him of his voice and of power to move </s>
<s> 
therethereat the windowclose before himso close that he could
have almost touched him before he started back </s>
<s>   with his eyes peering
into the room and meeting his </s>
<s>   there stood the jew </s>
<s>   and beside him
white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the man
who had accosted him in the innyard </s>
<s> 

it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes </s>
<s>  and they
were gone </s>
<s>   but they had recognised him and he them </s>
<s>  and their look
was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply
carved in stone and set before him from his birth </s>
<s>  he stood transfixed
for a moment </s>
<s>  then leaping from the window into the garden called
loudly for help </s>
<s> 



chapter xxxv

containing the unsatisfactory result of olivers adventure </s>
<s>  and a
conversation of some importance between harry maylie and rose

when the inmates of the house attracted by olivers cries hurried to
the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated
pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house and scarcely
able to articulate the words the jew </s>
<s>  the jew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant </s>
<s>  but harry
maylie whose perceptions were something quicker and who had heard
olivers history from his mother understood it at once </s>
<s> 

what direction did he take </s>
<s>  he asked catching up a heavy stick which
was standing in a corner </s>
<s> 

that replied oliver pointing out the course the man had taken </s>
<s>  i
missed them in an instant </s>
<s> 

then they are in the ditch </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s>   follow </s>
<s>   and keep as near
me as you can </s>
<s>  so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off
with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
others to keep near him </s>
<s> 

giles followed as well as he could </s>
<s>  and oliver followed too </s>
<s>  and in the
course of a minute or two <abvr> losberne who had been out walking and
just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking
himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to
possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting
all the while most prodigiously to know what was the matter </s>
<s> 

on they all went </s>
<s>  nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader
striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver began to
search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining </s>
<s>  which afforded time
for the remainder of the party to come up </s>
<s>  and for oliver to
communicate to <abvr> losberne the circumstances that had led to so
vigorous a pursuit </s>
<s> 

the search was all in vain </s>
<s>   there were not even the traces of recent
footsteps to be seen </s>
<s>   they stood now on the summit of a little hill
commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles </s>
<s> 
there was the village in the hollow on the left </s>
<s>  but in order to gain
that after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out the men must
have made a circuit of open ground which it was impossible they could
have accomplished in so short a time </s>
<s>   a thick wood skirted the
meadowland in another direction </s>
<s>  but they could not have gained that
covert for the same reason </s>
<s> 

it must have been a dream oliver said harry maylie </s>
<s> 

oh no indeed sir replied oliver shuddering at the very
recollection of the old wretchs countenance </s>
<s>  i saw him too plainly
for that </s>
<s>   i saw them both as plainly as i see you now </s>
<s> 

who was the other </s>
<s>  inquired harry and <abvr> losberne together </s>
<s> 

the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the
inn said oliver </s>
<s>   we had our eyes fixed full upon each other </s>
<s>  and i
could swear to him </s>
<s> 

they took this way </s>
<s>  demanded harry </s>
<s>   are you sure </s>
<s> 

as i am that the men were at the window replied oliver pointing
down as he spoke to the hedge which divided the cottagegarden from
the meadow </s>
<s>   the tall man leaped over just there </s>
<s>  and the jew
running a few paces to the right crept through that gap </s>
<s> 

the two gentlemen watched olivers earnest face as he spoke and
looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he said </s>
<s>   still in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight </s>
<s>   the grass was
long </s>
<s>  but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own feet had
crushed it </s>
<s>   the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay </s>
<s>  but
in no one place could they discern the print of mens shoes or the
slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
ground for hours before </s>
<s> 

this is strange </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s> 

strange </s>
<s>  echoed the doctor </s>
<s>   blathers and duff themselves could
make nothing of it </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did
not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further
prosecution hopeless </s>
<s>  and even then they gave it up with reluctance </s>
<s> 
giles was dispatched to the different alehouses in the village
furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance
and dress of the strangers </s>
<s>   of these the jew was at all events
sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen
drinking or loitering about </s>
<s>  but giles returned without any
intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery </s>
<s> 

on the next day fresh search was made and the inquiries renewed </s>
<s>  but
with no better success </s>
<s>   on the day following oliver and <abvr> maylie
repaired to the markettown in the hope of seeing or hearing something
of the men there </s>
<s>  but this effort was equally fruitless </s>
<s>   after a few
days the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when
wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself </s>
<s> 

meanwhile rose was rapidly recovering </s>
<s>   she had left her room </s>
<s>  was
able to go out </s>
<s>  and mixing once more with the family carried joy into
the hearts of all </s>
<s> 

but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
circle </s>
<s>  and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more
heard in the cottage </s>
<s>  there was at times an unwonted restraint upon
some there </s>
<s>   even upon rose herself </s>
<s>  which oliver could not fail to
remark </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie and her son were often closeted together for a
long time </s>
<s>  and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon
her face </s>
<s>   after <abvr> losberne had fixed a day for his departure to
chertsey these symptoms increased </s>
<s>  and it became evident that
something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady
and of somebody else besides </s>
<s> 

at length one morning when rose was alone in the breakfastparlour
harry maylie entered </s>
<s>  and with some hesitation begged permission to
speak with her for a few moments </s>
<s> 

a fewa very fewwill suffice rose said the young man drawing
his chair towards her </s>
<s>   what i shall have to say has already
presented itself to your mind </s>
<s>  the most cherished hopes of my heart are
not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated </s>
<s> 

rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance </s>
<s>  but that might
have been the effect of her recent illness </s>
<s>   she merely bowed </s>
<s>  and
bending over some plants that stood near waited in silence for him to
proceed </s>
<s> 

iiought to have left here before said harry </s>
<s> 

you should indeed replied rose </s>
<s>   forgive me for saying so but i
wish you had </s>
<s> 

i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all
apprehensions said the young man </s>
<s>  the fear of losing the one dear
being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed </s>
<s>   you had been dying </s>
<s> 
trembling between earth and heaven </s>
<s>   we know that when the young the
beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits
insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest </s>
<s>  we know
heaven help us </s>
<s>  that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade
in blooming </s>
<s> 

there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl as these words were
spoken </s>
<s>  and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent and
glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as
though the outpouring of her fresh young heart claimed kindred
naturally with the loveliest things in nature </s>
<s> 

a creature continued the young man passionately a creature as
fair and innocent of guile as one of gods own angels fluttered
between life and death </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  who could hope when the distant world to
which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to
the sorrow and calamity of this </s>
<s>   rose rose to know that you were
passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts
upon the earth </s>
<s>  to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
linger here </s>
<s>  hardly to know a reason why you should be </s>
<s>  to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
the best have winged their early flight </s>
<s>  and yet to pray amid all
these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved
youthese were distractions almost too great to bear </s>
<s>  they were mine
by day and night </s>
<s>  and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears
and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never
know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in
its course </s>
<s>   you recovered </s>
<s>  day by day and almost hour by hour some
drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a
high and rushing tide </s>
<s>   i have watched you change almost from death to
life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
affection </s>
<s>  do not tell me that you wish i had lost this </s>
<s>  for it has
softened my heart to all mankind </s>
<s> 

i did not mean that said rose weeping </s>
<s>  i only wish you had left
here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again </s>
<s>  to
pursuits well worthy of you </s>
<s> 

there is no pursuit more worthy of me </s>
<s>   more worthy of the highest
nature that exists </s>
<s>   than the struggle to win such a heart as yours
said the young man taking her hand </s>
<s>  rose my own dear rose </s>
<s>   for
yearsfor yearsi have loved you </s>
<s>  hoping to win my way to fame and
then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to
share </s>
<s>  thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy
moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boys attachment
and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that
had been sealed between us </s>
<s>   that time has not arrived </s>
<s>  but here with
not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so
long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the
offer </s>
<s> 

your behaviour has ever been kind and noble </s>
<s>  said rose mastering the
emotions by which she was agitated </s>
<s>   as you believe that i am not
insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer </s>
<s> 

it is that i may endeavour to deserve you </s>
<s>  it is dear rose </s>
<s> 

it is replied rose that you must endeavour to forget me </s>
<s>  not as
your old and dearlyattached companion for that would wound me deeply </s>
<s>

<s>  think how many
hearts you would be proud to gain are there </s>
<s>  confide some other
passion to me if you will </s>
<s>  i will be the truest warmest and most
faithful friend you have </s>
<s> 

there was a pause during which rose who had covered her face with
one hand gave free vent to her tears </s>
<s>   harry still retained the other </s>
<s> 

and your reasons rose he said at length in a low voice </s>
<s>  your
reasons for this decision </s>

you have a right to know them rejoined rose </s>

<s>   i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless

should we prolong this painful interview </s>
<s>   most painful to me and yet
productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding </s>
<s>  for it will be
happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which
i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me
with new fortitude and firmness </s>
<s>   farewell harry </s>
<s>   as we have met
today we meet no more </s>
<s>  but in other relations than those in which
this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined </s>
<s> 
and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can
call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper
you </s>
<s> 

another word rose said harry </s>
<s>   your reason in your own words </s>
<s> 
from your own lips let me hear it </s>
<s> 

the prospect before you answered rose firmly is a brilliant one </s>
<s> 
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can
help men in public life are in store for you </s>
<s>  but those connections
are proud </s>
<s>  and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the
mother who gave me life </s>
<s>  nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of
her who has so well supplied that mothers place </s>
<s>   in a word said the
young lady turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there
is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads </s>
<s>   i
will carry it into no blood but my own </s>
<s>  and the reproach shall rest
alone on me </s>
<s> 

one word more rose </s>
<s>   dearest rose </s>
<s>  one more </s>
<s>  cried harry throwing
himself before her </s>
<s>   if i had been lessless fortunate the world
would call itif some obscure and peaceful life had been my
destinyif i had been poor sick helplesswould you have turned from
me then </s>
<s>   or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given
this scruple birth </s>
<s> 

do not press me to reply answered rose </s>
<s>   the question does not
arise and never will </s>
<s>   it is unfair almost unkind to urge it </s>
<s> 

if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted harry
it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the
path before me </s>
<s>   it is not an idle thing to do so much by the
utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else </s>
<s> 
oh rose </s>
<s>  in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment </s>
<s>  in the name
of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo </s>
<s>  answer
me this one question </s>
<s> 

then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined rose </s>
<s>  if you
had been even a little but not so far above me </s>
<s>  if i could have been
a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement
and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds </s>
<s>  i
should have been spared this trial </s>
<s>   i have every reason to be happy
very happy now </s>
<s>  but then harry i own i should have been happier </s>
<s> 

busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a girl long ago crowded
into the mind of rose while making this avowal </s>
<s>  but they brought tears
with them as old hopes will when they come back withered </s>
<s>  and they
relieved her </s>
<s> 

i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said
rose extending her hand </s>
<s>   i must leave you now indeed </s>
<s> 

i ask one promise said harry </s>
<s>   once and only once moresay
within a year but it may be much sooneri may speak to you again on
this subject for the last time </s>
<s> 

not to press me to alter my right determination replied rose with a
melancholy smile </s>
<s>  it will be useless </s>
<s> 

no said harry </s>
<s>  to hear you repeat it if you willfinally repeat
it </s>
<s>   i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may
possess </s>
<s>  and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not
seek by word or act to change it </s>
<s> 

then let it be so rejoined rose </s>
<s>  it is but one pang the more and
by that time i may be enabled to bear it better </s>
<s> 

she extended her hand again </s>
<s>   but the young man caught her to his
bosom </s>
<s>  and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead hurried from
the room </s>

chapter xxxvi

is a very short one and may appear of no great importance in its
place but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last
and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives

and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning </s>
<s> 
eh </s>
<s>  said the doctor as harry maylie joined him and oliver at the
breakfasttable </s>
<s>   why you are not in the same mind or intention two
halfhours together </s>
<s> 

you will tell me a different tale one of these days said harry
colouring without any perceptible reason </s>
<s> 

i hope i may have good cause to do so replied <abvr> losberne </s>
<s>  though
i confess i dont think i shall </s>
<s>   but yesterday morning you had made up
your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your
mother like a dutiful son to the seaside </s>
<s>  before noon you announce
that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i
go on your road to london </s>
<s>   and at night you urge me with great
mystery to start before the ladies are stirring </s>
<s>  the consequence of
which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when
he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all
kinds </s>
<s>  too bad isnt it oliver </s>
<s> 

i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and
mr </s>
<s>  maylie went away sir rejoined oliver </s>
<s> 

thats a fine fellow said the doctor </s>
<s>  you shall come and see me
when you return </s>
<s>   but to speak seriously harry </s>
<s>  has any communication
from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be
gone </s>
<s> 

the great nobs replied harry under which designation i presume
you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at
all since i have been here </s>
<s>  nor at this time of the year is it
likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate
attendance among them </s>
<s> 

well said the doctor you are a queer fellow </s>
<s>   but of course they
will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and
these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political
life </s>
<s>   theres something in that </s>
<s>   good training is always desirable
whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes </s>
<s> 

harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue
by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a
little </s>
<s>  but he contented himself with saying we shall see and
pursued the subject no farther </s>
<s>   the postchaise drove up to the door
shortly afterwards </s>
<s>  and giles coming in for the luggage the good
doctor bustled out to see it packed </s>
<s> 

oliver said harry maylie in a low voice let me speak a word with
you </s>
<s> 

oliver walked into the windowrecess to which <abvr> maylie beckoned him </s>
<s> 
much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits which
his whole behaviour displayed </s>
<s> 

you can write well now </s>
<s>  said harry laying his hand upon his arm </s>
<s> 

i hope so sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time </s>
<s>  i wish you would
write to mesay once a fortnight </s>
<s>   every alternate monday </s>
<s>  to the
general post office in london </s>
<s>   will you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly sir </s>
<s>  i shall be proud to do it exclaimed oliver
greatly delighted with the commission </s>
<s> 

i should like to know howhow my mother and miss maylie are said
the young man </s>
<s>  and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks
you take and what you talk about and whether shethey i meanseem
happy and quite well </s>
<s>  you understand me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  quite sir quite replied oliver </s>
<s> 

i would rather you did not mention it to them said harry hurrying
over his words </s>
<s>  because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her </s>
<s>  let it be a secret
between you and me </s>
<s>  and mind you tell me everything </s>
<s>   i depend upon
you </s>
<s> 

oliver quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance
faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  maylie took leave of him with many assurances of his regard and
protection </s>
<s> 

the doctor was in the chaise </s>
<s>  giles who it had been arranged should
be left behind held the door open in his hand </s>
<s>  and the womenservants
were in the garden looking on </s>
<s>   harry cast one slight glance at the
latticed window and jumped into the carriage </s>
<s> 

drive on </s>
<s>  he cried hard fast full gallop </s>
<s>   nothing short of
flying will keep pace with me today </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  cried the doctor letting down the front glass in a great
hurry and shouting to the postillion </s>
<s>  something very short of flying
will keep pace with me </s>
<s>   do you hear </s>
<s> 

jingling and clattering till distance rendered its noise inaudible
and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye the vehicle wound
its way along the road almost hidden in a cloud of dust </s>
<s>  now wholly
disappearing and now becoming visible again as intervening objects
or the intricacies of the way permitted </s>
<s>   it was not until even the
dusty cloud was no longer to be seen that the gazers dispersed </s>
<s> 

and there was one lookeron who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot
where the carriage had disappeared long after it was many miles away </s>
<s> 
for behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when
harry raised his eyes towards the window sat rose herself </s>
<s> 

he seems in high spirits and happy she said at length </s>
<s>  i feared
for a time he might be otherwise </s>
<s>   i was mistaken </s>
<s>   i am very very
glad </s>
<s> 

tears are signs of gladness as well as grief </s>
<s>  but those which coursed
down roses face as she sat pensively at the window still gazing in
the same direction seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy </s>

chapter xxxvii

in which the reader may perceive a contrast not uncommon in
matrimonial cases

mr </s>
<s>  bumble sat in the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on
the cheerless grate whence as it was summer time no brighter gleam
proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which
were sent back from its cold and shining surface </s>
<s>   a paper flycage
dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in
gloomy thought </s>
<s>  and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy
network <abvr> bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy
shadow overspread his countenance </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was meditating </s>
<s>  it might
be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own
past life </s>
<s> 

nor was <abvr> bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator </s>
<s>  there were not wanting
other appearances and those closely connected with his own person
which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of
his affairs </s>
<s>   the laced coat and the cocked hat </s>
<s>  where were they </s>
<s>   he
still wore kneebreeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether
limbs </s>
<s>  but they were not the breeches </s>
<s>   the coat was wideskirted </s>
<s> 
and in that respect like the coat but oh how different </s>
<s>   the mighty
cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was no
longer a beadle </s>
<s> 

there are some promotions in life which independent of the more
substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from
the coats and waistcoats connected with them </s>
<s>   a fieldmarshal has his
uniform </s>
<s>  a bishop his silk apron </s>
<s>  a counsellor his silk gown </s>
<s>  a beadle
his cocked hat </s>
<s>   strip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his
hat and lace </s>
<s>  what are they </s>
<s>   men </s>
<s>   mere men </s>
<s>   dignity and even
holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than
some people imagine </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had married <abvr> corney and was master of the workhouse </s>
<s> 
another beadle had come into power </s>
<s>   on him the cocked hat goldlaced
coat and staff had all three descended </s>
<s> 

and tomorrow two months it was done </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble with a sigh </s>
<s> 
it seems a age </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence
of happiness into the short space of eight weeks </s>
<s>  but the sighthere
was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh </s>
<s> 

i sold myself said <abvr> bumble pursuing the same train of relection
for six teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a milkpot </s>
<s>  with a small
quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money </s>
<s>   i went
very reasonable </s>
<s>   cheap dirt cheap </s>
<s> 

cheap </s>
<s>  cried a shrill voice in <abvr> bumbles ear </s>
<s>  you would have been
dear at any price </s>
<s>  and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows
that </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort
who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his
complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bumble maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble with a sentimental sternness </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  cried the lady </s>
<s> 

have the goodness to look at me said <abvr> bumble fixing his eyes
upon her </s>
<s>   if she stands such a eye as that said <abvr> bumble to
himself she can stand anything </s>
<s>   it is a eye i never knew to fail
with paupers </s>
<s>   if it fails with her my power is gone </s>
<s> 

whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition </s>
<s>  or
whether the late <abvr> corney was particularly proof against eagle
glances </s>
<s>  are matters of opinion </s>
<s>   the matter of fact is that the
matron was in no way overpowered by <abvr> bumbles scowl but on the
contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh
thereat which sounded as though it were genuine </s>
<s> 

on hearing this most unexpected sound <abvr> bumble looked first
incredulous and afterwards amazed </s>
<s>   he then relapsed into his former
state </s>
<s>  nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened
by the voice of his partner </s>
<s> 

are you going to sit snoring there all day </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

i am going to sit here as long as i think proper maam rejoined
mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>  and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape
sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me </s>
<s>  such being my
prerogative </s>
<s> 

your prerogative </s>
<s>  sneered <abvr> bumble with ineffable contempt </s>
<s> 

i said the word maam said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   the prerogative of a man
is to command </s>
<s> 

and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness </s>
<s>  cried
the relict of <abvr> corney deceased </s>
<s> 

to obey maam thundered <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   your late unfortunate husband
should have taught it you </s>
<s>  and then perhaps he might have been alive
now </s>
<s>   i wish he was poor man </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now
arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or
other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this
allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with
a loud scream that <abvr> bumble was a hardhearted brute fell into a
paroxysm of tears </s>
<s> 

but tears were not the things to find their way to <abvr> bumbles soul </s>
<s> 
his heart was waterproof </s>
<s>   like washable beaver hats that improve with
rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of
tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of
his own power pleased and exalted him </s>
<s>   he eyed his good lady with
looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that
she should cry her hardest </s>
<s>   the exercise being looked upon by the
faculty as strongly conducive to health </s>
<s> 

it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and
softens down the temper said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   so cry away </s>
<s> 

as he discharged himself of this pleasantry <abvr> bumble took his hat
from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on one side as a man
might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner
thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with
much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> corney that was had tried the tears because they were less
troublesome than a manual assault </s>
<s>  but she was quite prepared to make
trial of the latter mode of proceeding as <abvr> bumble was not long in
discovering </s>
<s> 

the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow
sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
opposite end of the room </s>
<s>   this preliminary proceeding laying bare his
head the expert lady clasping him tightly round the throat with one
hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and
dexterity upon it with the other </s>
<s>   this done she created a little
variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair </s>
<s>  and having by
this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the
offence she pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated
for the purpose </s>
<s>   and defied him to talk about his prerogative again
if he dared </s>
<s> 

get up </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble in a voice of command </s>
<s>   and take yourself
away from here unless you want me to do something desperate </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble rose with a very rueful countenance </s>
<s>   wondering much what
something desperate might be </s>
<s>   picking up his hat he looked towards
the door </s>
<s> 

are you going </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear certainly rejoined <abvr> bumble making a quicker
motion towards the door </s>
<s>   i didnt intend toim going my dear </s>
<s>   you
are so very violent that really i

at this instant <abvr> bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble
immediately darted out of the room without bestowing another thought
on his unfinished sentence </s>
<s>   leaving the late <abvr> corney in full
possession of the field </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten </s>
<s>   he had a
decided propensity for bullying </s>
<s>   derived no inconsiderable pleasure
from the exercise of petty cruelty </s>
<s>  and consequently was it is
needless to say a coward </s>
<s>   this is by no means a disparagement to his
character </s>
<s>  for many official personages who are held in high respect
and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities </s>
<s>   the remark is
made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of
impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for
office </s>
<s> 

but the measure of his degradation was not yet full </s>
<s>   after making a
tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poorlaws
really were too hard on people </s>
<s>  and that men who ran away from their
wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be
visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious
individuals who had suffered much </s>
<s>  <abvr> bumble came to a room where some
of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish
linen </s>
<s>   when the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble summoning up all his native dignity </s>
<s>  these
women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative </s>
<s>  hallo </s>
<s>  hallo
there </s>
<s>   what do you mean by this noise you hussies </s>
<s> 

with these words <abvr> bumble opened the door and walked in with a very
fierce and angry manner </s>
<s>   which was at once exchanged for a most
humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the
form of his lady wife </s>
<s> 

my dear said <abvr> bumble i didnt know you were here </s>
<s> 

didnt know i was here </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   what do you do
here </s>
<s> 

i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
properly my dear replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   glancing distractedly at a
couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of
admiration at the workhousemasters humility </s>
<s> 

you thought they were talking too much </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  what
business is it of yours </s>
<s> 

why my dear urged <abvr> bumble submissively </s>
<s> 

what business is it of yours </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> bumble again </s>
<s> 

its very true youre matron here my dear submitted <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 
but i thought you mightnt be in the way just then </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what <abvr> bumble returned his lady </s>
<s>   we dont want
any of your interference </s>
<s>   youre a great deal too fond of poking your
nose into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house
laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a
fool every hour in the day </s>
<s>   be off </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two
old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated
for an instant </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble whose patience brooked no delay caught
up a bowl of soapsuds and motioning him towards the door ordered him
instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly
person </s>
<s> 

what could <abvr> bumble do </s>
<s>   he looked dejectedly round and slunk away </s>
<s> 
and as he reached the door the titterings of the paupers broke into a
shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight </s>
<s>   it wanted but this </s>
<s>   he was
degraded in their eyes </s>
<s>  he had lost caste and station before the very
paupers </s>
<s>  he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to
the lowest depth of the most snubbed henpeckery </s>
<s> 

all in two months </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble filled with dismal thoughts </s>
<s> 
two months </s>
<s>   no more than two months ago i was not only my own
master but everybody elses so far as the porochial workhouse was
concerned and now </s>
<s> 

it was too much </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie </s>
<s>  and
walked distractedly into the street </s>
<s> 

he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated
the first passion of his grief </s>
<s>  and then the revulsion of feeling made
him thirsty </s>
<s>   he passed a great many publichouses </s>
<s>  but at length
paused before one in a byway whose parlour as he gathered from a
hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary
customer </s>
<s>   it began to rain heavily at the moment </s>
<s>   this determined
him </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble stepped in </s>
<s>  and ordering something to drink as he
passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the
street </s>
<s> 

the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large
cloak </s>
<s>   he had the air of a stranger </s>
<s>  and seemed by a certain
haggardness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to
have travelled some distance </s>
<s>   he eyed bumble askance as he entered
but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his
salutation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had quite dignity enough for two </s>
<s>  supposing even that the
stranger had been more familiar </s>
<s>   so he drank his ginandwater in
silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance </s>
<s> 

it so happened however </s>
<s>  as it will happen very often when men fall
into company under such circumstances </s>
<s>   that <abvr> bumble felt every now
and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a
look at the stranger </s>
<s>   and that whenever he did so he withdrew his
eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment
stealing a look at him </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the
very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and
bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike
anything he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold </s>
<s> 

when they had encountered each others glance several times in this
way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence </s>
<s> 

were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window </s>
<s> 

not that i am aware of unless youre <abvr>  here <abvr> bumble stopped
short </s>
<s>  for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in
his impatience he might supply the blank </s>
<s> 

i see you were not said the stranger </s>
<s>  an expression of quiet sarcasm
playing about his mouth </s>
<s>  or you have known my name </s>
<s>   you dont know
it </s>
<s>   i would recommend you not to ask for it </s>
<s> 

i meant no harm young man observed <abvr> bumble majestically </s>
<s> 

and have done none said the stranger </s>
<s> 

another silence succeeded this short dialogue </s>
<s>   which was again broken
by the stranger </s>
<s> 

i have seen you before i think </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>   you were differently
dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should
know you again </s>
<s>   you were beadle here once </s>
<s>  were you not </s>
<s> 

i was said <abvr> bumble in some surprise </s>
<s>  porochial beadle </s>
<s> 

just so rejoined the other nodding his head </s>
<s>   it was in that
character i saw you </s>
<s>   what are you now </s>
<s> 

master of the workhouse rejoined <abvr> bumble slowly and
impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might
otherwise assume </s>
<s>   master of the workhouse young man </s>
<s> 

you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i
doubt not </s>
<s>  resumed the stranger looking keenly into <abvr> bumbles
eyes as he raised them in astonishment at the question </s>
<s> 

dont scruple to answer freely man </s>
<s>   i know you pretty well you see </s>
<s> 

i suppose a married man replied <abvr> bumble shading his eyes with
his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident
perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can
than a single one </s>
<s>   porochial officers are not so well paid that they
can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a
civil and proper manner </s>
<s> 

the stranger smiled and nodded his head again </s>
<s>  as much to say he had
not mistaken his man </s>
<s>  then rang the bell </s>
<s> 

fill this glass again he said handing <abvr> bumbles empty tumbler to
the landlord </s>
<s>   let it be strong and hot </s>
<s>   you like it so i suppose </s>
<s> 

not too strong replied <abvr> bumble with a delicate cough </s>
<s> 

you understand what that means landlord </s>
<s>  said the stranger drily </s>
<s> 

the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a
steaming jorum </s>
<s>  of which the first gulp brought the water into <abvr>
bumbles eyes </s>
<s> 

now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and
window </s>
<s>   i came down to this place today to find you out </s>
<s>  and by
one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends
sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you
were uppermost in my mind </s>
<s>   i want some information from you </s>
<s>   i dont
ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is </s>
<s>   put up that to begin
with </s>
<s> 

as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
companion carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money
should be heard without </s>
<s>   when <abvr> bumble had scrupulously examined the
coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much
satisfaction in his waistcoatpocket he went on </s>
<s>

the scene the workhouse </s>

and the time night </s>

the lyingin room i suppose </s>

yes said the stranger </s>
<s>   a boy was born there </s>

a many boys observed <abvr> bumble shaking his head despondingly </s>

a murrain on the young devils </s>
<s>  cried the stranger </s>
<s>  i speak of one </s>
<s>  a
meeklooking palefaced boy who was apprenticed down here to a
coffinmakeri wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in
itand who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed </s>
<s> 

why you mean oliver </s>
<s>   young twist </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  i remember him
of course </s>
<s>   there wasnt a obstinater young rascal

its not of him i want to hear </s>
<s>  ive heard enough of him said the
stranger stopping <abvr> bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject
of poor olivers vices </s>
<s>   its of a woman </s>
<s>  the hag that nursed his
mother </s>
<s>   where is she </s>
<s> 

where is she </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble whom the ginandwater had rendered
facetious </s>
<s>   it would be hard to tell </s>
<s>   theres no midwifery there
whichever place shes gone to </s>
<s>  so i suppose shes out of employment
anyway </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  demanded the stranger sternly </s>
<s> 

that she died last winter rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and
although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards his
gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in
thought </s>
<s>   for some time he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be
relieved or disappointed by the intelligence </s>
<s>  but at length he breathed
more freely </s>
<s>  and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great
matter </s>
<s>  with that he rose as if to depart </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> bumble was cunning enough </s>
<s>  and he at once saw that an
opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in
the possession of his better half </s>
<s>   he well remembered the night of old
sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good
reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to <abvr>
corney </s>
<s>  and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure
of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know
that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans
attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist </s>
<s> 
hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger
with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old
harridan shortly before she died </s>
<s>  and that she could as he had reason
to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry </s>
<s> 

how can i find her </s>
<s>  said the stranger thrown off his guard </s>
<s>  and
plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused
afresh by the intelligence </s>
<s> 

only through me rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

when </s>
<s>  cried the stranger hastily </s>
<s> 

tomorrow rejoined bumble </s>
<s> 

at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of
paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the waterside
in characters that betrayed his agitation </s>
<s>  at nine in the evening
bring her to me there </s>
<s>   i neednt tell you to be secret </s>
<s>   its your
interest </s>
<s> 

with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for
the liquor that had been drunk </s>
<s>   shortly remarking that their roads
were different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic
repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night </s>
<s> 

on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it
contained no name </s>
<s>   the stranger had not gone far so he made after him
to ask it </s>
<s> 

what do you want </s>
<s>  cried the man turning quickly round as bumble
touched him on the arm </s>
<s>   following me </s>
<s> 

only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of
paper </s>

chapter xxxviii

containing an account of what passed between <abvr> and <abvr> bumble and
mr </s>
<s>  monks at their nocturnal interview

it was a dull close overcast summer evening </s>
<s>   the clouds which had
been threatening all day spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of
vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a
violent thunderstorm when <abvr> and <abvr> bumble turning out of the
main street of the town directed their course towards a scattered
little colony of ruinous houses distant from it some mile and ahalf
or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon
the river </s>
<s> 

they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might
perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
rain and sheltering them from observation </s>
<s>   the husband carried a
lantern from which however no light yet shone </s>
<s>  and trudged on a few
paces in front as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the
benefit of treading in his heavy footprints </s>
<s>   they went on in profound
silence </s>
<s>  every now and then <abvr> bumble relaxed his pace and turned
his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following </s>
<s>  then
discovering that she was close at his heels he mended his rate of
walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards
their place of destination </s>
<s> 

this was far from being a place of doubtful character </s>
<s>  for it had long
been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under
various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on
plunder and crime </s>
<s>   it was a collection of mere hovels </s>
<s>   some hastily
built with loose bricks </s>
<s>  others of old wormeaten shiptimber </s>
<s>  jumbled
together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for
the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank </s>
<s>   a few leaky
boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which
skirted it </s>
<s>   and here and there an oar or coil of rope </s>
<s>   appeared at
first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages
pursued some avocation on the river </s>
<s>  but a glance at the shattered and
useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a
passerby without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were
disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with
any view to their being actually employed </s>
<s> 

in the heart of this cluster of huts </s>
<s>  and skirting the river which its
upper stories overhung </s>
<s>  stood a large building formerly used as a
manufactory of some kind </s>
<s>   it had in its day probably furnished
employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements </s>
<s>   but it had
long since gone to ruin </s>
<s>   the rat the worm and the action of the
damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood </s>
<s>  and a
considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the
water </s>
<s>  while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream
seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion
and involving itself in the same fate </s>
<s> 

it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as
the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain
commenced pouring violently down </s>
<s> 

the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap
of paper he held in his hand </s>
<s> 

halloa there </s>
<s>  cried a voice from above </s>
<s> 

following the sound <abvr> bumble raised his head and descried a man
looking out of a door breasthigh on the second story </s>
<s> 

stand still a minute cried the voice </s>
<s>  ill be with you directly </s>
<s> 
with which the head disappeared and the door closed </s>
<s> 

is that the man </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> bumbles good lady </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded in the affirmative </s>
<s> 

then mind what i told you said the matron </s>
<s>  and be careful to say
as little as you can or youll betray us at once </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was
apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was
prevented by the appearance of monks </s>
<s>  who opened a small door near
which they stood and beckoned them inwards </s>
<s> 

come in </s>
<s>  he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground </s>
<s> 
dont keep me here </s>
<s> 

the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any
other invitation </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind
followed </s>
<s>   obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that
remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic </s>
<s> 

what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet </s>
<s>  said
monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the
door behind them </s>
<s> 

wewe were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking
apprehensively about him </s>
<s> 

cooling yourselves </s>
<s>  retorted monks </s>
<s>   not all the rain that ever
fell or ever will fall will put as much of hells fire out as a man
can carry about with him </s>
<s>   you wont cool yourself so easily </s>
<s>  dont
think it </s>
<s> 

with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and
bent his gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was
fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground </s>
<s> 

this is the woman is it </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>   that is the woman replied <abvr> bumble mindful of his wifes
caution </s>
<s> 

you think women never can keep secrets i suppose </s>
<s>  said the matron
interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks </s>
<s> 

i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks </s>
<s> 

and what may that be </s>
<s>  asked the matron </s>
<s> 

the loss of their own good name replied monks </s>
<s>   so by the same
rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her im not afraid of her telling it to anybody </s>
<s>  not i </s>
<s>   do you
understand mistress </s>
<s> 

no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke </s>
<s> 

of course you dont </s>
<s>  said monks </s>
<s>   how should you </s>
<s> 

bestowing something halfway between a smile and a frown upon his two
companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened
across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the
roof </s>
<s>   he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder
leading to another floor of warehouses above </s>
<s>   when a bright flash of
lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed
which shook the crazy building to its centre </s>
<s> 

hear it </s>
<s>  he cried shrinking back </s>
<s>   hear it </s>
<s>   rolling and crashing
on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were
hiding from it </s>
<s>   i hate the sound </s>
<s> 

he remained silent for a few moments </s>
<s>  and then removing his hands
suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable discomposure of <abvr>
bumble that it was much distorted and discoloured </s>
<s> 

these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his
alarm </s>
<s>  and thunder sometimes brings them on </s>
<s>  dont mind me now </s>
<s>  its
all over for this once </s>
<s> 

thus speaking he led the way up the ladder </s>
<s>  and hastily closing the
windowshutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which
hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy
beams in the ceiling </s>
<s>   and which cast a dim light upon an old table and
three chairs that were placed beneath it </s>
<s> 

now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the
sooner we come to our business the better for all </s>
<s>   the woman know
what it is does she </s>
<s> 

the question was addressed to bumble </s>
<s>  but his wife anticipated the
reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it </s>
<s> 

he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died </s>
<s> 
and that she told you something

about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron
interrupting him </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

the first question is of what nature was her communication </s>
<s>  said
monks </s>
<s> 

thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation </s>
<s>  the
first is what may the communication be worth </s>
<s> 

who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is </s>
<s> 
asked monks </s>
<s> 

nobody better than you i am persuaded answered <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  who did
not want for spirit as her yokefellow could abundantly testify </s>
<s> 

humph </s>
<s>  said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry </s>
<s> 
there may be moneys worth to get eh </s>
<s> 

perhaps there may was the composed reply </s>
<s> 

something that was taken from her said monks </s>
<s>   something that she
wore </s>
<s>   something that

you had better bid interrupted <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   i have heard enough
already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any
greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened
to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes </s>
<s>   which he
directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised
astonishment </s>
<s>  increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded
what sum was required for the disclosure </s>
<s> 

whats it worth to you </s>
<s>  asked the woman as collectedly as before </s>
<s> 

it may be nothing </s>
<s>  it may be twenty pounds replied monks </s>
<s>  speak
out and let me know which </s>
<s> 

add five pounds to the sum you have named </s>
<s>  give me fiveandtwenty
pounds in gold said the woman </s>
<s>  and ill tell you all i know </s>
<s>   not
before </s>
<s> 

fiveandtwenty pounds </s>
<s>  exclaimed monks drawing back </s>
<s> 

i spoke as plainly as i could replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   its not a
large sum either </s>
<s> 

not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when its
told </s>
<s>  cried monks impatiently </s>
<s>  and which has been lying dead for
twelve years past or more </s>
<s> 

such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value
in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute
indifference she had assumed </s>
<s>   as to lying dead there are those who
will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for
anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last </s>
<s> 

what if i pay it for nothing </s>
<s>  asked monks hesitating </s>
<s> 

you can easily take it away again replied the matron </s>
<s>  i am but a
woman </s>
<s>  alone here </s>
<s>  and unprotected </s>
<s> 

not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted <abvr> bumble
in a voice tremulous with fear </s>
<s>  i am here my dear </s>
<s>  and besides
said <abvr> bumble his teeth chattering as he spoke <abvr> monks is too
much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons </s>
<s>   <abvr>
monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a
little run to seed as i may say </s>
<s>  bu he has heerd </s>
<s>   i say i have no
doubt <abvr> monks has heerd my dear </s>
<s>   that i am a very determined
officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused </s>
<s>   i only want
a little rousing </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern
with fierce determination </s>
<s>  and plainly showed by the alarmed
expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and
not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration </s>
<s>  unless
indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for
the purpose </s>
<s> 

you are a fool said <abvr> bumble in reply </s>
<s>  and had better hold your
tongue </s>
<s> 

he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a
lower tone said monks grimly </s>
<s>   so </s>
<s>   hes your husband eh </s>
<s> 

he my husband </s>
<s>  tittered the matron parrying the question </s>
<s> 

i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the
angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke </s>
<s>   so
much the better </s>
<s>  i have less hesitation in dealing with two people
when i find that theres only one will between them </s>
<s>   im in earnest </s>
<s> 
see here </s>
<s> 

he thrust his hand into a sidepocket </s>
<s>  and producing a canvas bag told
out twentyfive sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the
woman </s>
<s> 

now he said gather them up </s>
<s>  and when this cursed peal of thunder
which i feel is coming up to break over the housetop is gone lets
hear your story </s>
<s> 

the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break
almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from
the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say </s>
<s>   the
faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the small
table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to
render her whisper audible </s>
<s>   the sickly rays of the suspended lantern
falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of
their countenances </s>
<s>  which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness
looked ghastly in the extreme </s>
<s> 

when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began
she and i were alone </s>
<s> 

was there no one by </s>
<s>  asked monks in the same hollow whisper </s>
<s>  no
sick wretch or idiot in some other bed </s>
<s>   no one who could hear and
might by possibility understand </s>
<s> 

not a soul replied the woman </s>
<s>  we were alone </s>
<s>   i stood alone
beside the body when death came over it </s>
<s> 

good said monks regarding her attentively </s>
<s>   go on </s>
<s> 

she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a
child into the world some years before </s>
<s>  not merely in the same room
but in the same bed in which she then lay dying </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder
blood </s>
<s>   how things come about </s>
<s> 

the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron
nodding carelessly towards her husband </s>
<s>  the mother this nurse had
robbed </s>
<s> 

in life </s>
<s>  asked monks </s>
<s> 

in death replied the woman with something like a shudder </s>
<s>  she
stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the
dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the
infants sake </s>
<s> 

she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness </s>
<s>  did she sell it </s>
<s> 
where </s>
<s>   when </s>
<s>   to whom </s>
<s>   how long before </s>
<s> 

as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said
the matron she fell back and died </s>
<s> 

without saying more </s>
<s>  cried monks in a voice which from its very
suppression seemed only the more furious </s>
<s>   its a lie </s>
<s>  ill not be
played with </s>
<s>   she said more </s>
<s>   ill tear the life out of you both but
ill know what it was </s>
<s> 

she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance
unmoved as <abvr> bumble was very far from being by the strange mans
violence </s>
<s>  but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which
was partly closed </s>
<s>  and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the
hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper </s>
<s> 

which contained interposed monks stretching forward </s>
<s> 

nothing replied the woman </s>
<s>  it was a pawnbrokers duplicate </s>
<s> 

for what </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

in good time ill tell you </s>
<s>  said the woman </s>
<s>   i judge that she had
kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better
account </s>
<s>  and then had pawned it </s>
<s>  and had saved or scraped together
money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its
running out </s>
<s>  so that if anything came of it it could still be
redeemed </s>
<s>   nothing had come of it </s>
<s>  and as i tell you she died with
the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand </s>
<s>   the time was
out in two days </s>
<s>  i thought something might one day come of it too </s>
<s>  and
so redeemed the pledge </s>
<s> 

where is it now </s>
<s>  asked monks quickly </s>
<s> 

there replied the woman </s>
<s>   and as if glad to be relieved of it
she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough
for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling
hands </s>
<s>   it contained a little gold locket </s>
<s>  in which were two locks of
hair and a plain gold weddingring </s>
<s> 

it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman </s>
<s> 

there is a blank left for the surname </s>
<s>  and then follows the date </s>
<s> 
which is within a year before the child was born </s>
<s>   i found out that </s>
<s> 

and this is all </s>
<s>  said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the
contents of the little packet </s>
<s> 

all replied the woman </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the
story was over and no mention made of taking the fiveandtwenty
pounds back again </s>
<s>  and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration
which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of
the previous dialogue </s>
<s> 

i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his
wife addressing monks after a short silence </s>
<s>  and i want to know
nothing </s>
<s>  for its safer not </s>
<s>   but i may ask you two questions may i </s>
<s> 

you may ask said monks with some show of surprise </s>
<s>  but whether i
answer or not is another question </s>
<s> 

which makes three observed <abvr> bumble essaying a stroke of
facetiousness </s>
<s> 

is that what you expected to get from me </s>
<s>  demanded the matron </s>
<s> 

it is replied monks </s>
<s>   the other question </s>
<s> 

what do you propose to do with it </s>
<s>   can it be used against me </s>
<s> 

never rejoined monks </s>
<s>  nor against me either </s>
<s>   see here </s>
<s>   but dont
move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush </s>
<s> 

with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an
iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened
close at <abvr> bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several
paces backward with great precipitation </s>
<s> 

look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf </s>
<s>  dont
fear me </s>
<s>   i could have let you down quietly enough when you were
seated over it if that had been my game </s>
<s> 

thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink </s>
<s>  and even <abvr> bumble
himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same </s>
<s>  the turbid
water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below </s>
<s>  and all
other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against
the green and slimy piles </s>
<s>   there had once been a watermill beneath </s>
<s> 
the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments
of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new
impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted
to stem its headlong course </s>
<s> 

if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow
morning </s>
<s>  said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well </s>
<s> 

twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied
bumble recoiling at the thought </s>
<s> 

monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly
thrust it </s>
<s>  and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed a part of
some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream </s>
<s> 
it fell straight and true as a die </s>
<s>  clove the water with a scarcely
audible splash </s>
<s>  and was gone </s>
<s> 

the three looking into each others faces seemed to breathe more
freely </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back
into its former position </s>
<s>   if the sea ever gives up its dead as books
say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash
among it </s>
<s>   we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant
party </s>
<s> 

by all means observed <abvr> bumble with great alacrity </s>
<s> 

youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you </s>
<s>  said monks with a
threatening look </s>
<s>   i am not afraid of your wife </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon me young man answered <abvr> bumble bowing
himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness </s>
<s>  on
everybodys account young man </s>
<s>  on my own you know <abvr> monks </s>
<s> 

i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks </s>
<s>  light your
lantern </s>
<s>   and get away from here as fast as you can </s>
<s> 

it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or <abvr>
bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would
infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below </s>
<s>   he lighted his
lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now
carried in his hand </s>
<s>  and making no effort to prolong the discourse
descended in silence followed by his wife </s>
<s>   monks brought up the rear
after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other
sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the
rushing of the water </s>
<s> 

they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution </s>
<s>  for monks
started at every shadow </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bumble holding his lantern a foot
above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a
marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure </s>
<s>   looking
nervously about him for hidden trapdoors </s>
<s>   the gate at which they had
entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks </s>
<s>  merely exchanging a
nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into
the wet and darkness outside </s>
<s> 

they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an
invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been
hidden somewhere below </s>
<s>  bidding him go first and bear the light he
returned to the chamber he had just quitted </s>
<s> 



chapter xxxix

introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already
acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads
together

on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned
in the last </s>
<s> disposed of their little matter of business as
therein narrated <abvr> william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily
growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was </s>
<s> 

the room in which <abvr> sikes propounded this question was not one of
those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it
was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great
distance from his former lodgings </s>
<s>   it was not in appearance so
desirable a habitation as his old quarters </s>
<s>   being a mean and
badlyfurnished apartment of very limited size </s>
<s>  lighted only by one
small window in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty
lane </s>
<s>   nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans
having gone down in the world of late </s>
<s>   for a great scarcity of
furniture and total absence of comfort together with the
disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen
bespoke a state of extreme poverty </s>
<s>  while the meagre and attenuated
condition of <abvr> sikes himself would have fully confirmed these
symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration </s>
<s> 

the housebreaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat
by way of dressinggown and displaying a set of features in no degree
improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled

the bedside </s>

pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the
street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention </s>
<s> 
seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which
formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female </s>
<s>   so pale
and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been
considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has
already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to
mr </s>
<s>  sikess question </s>
<s> 

not long gone seven said the girl </s>
<s>   how do you feel tonight bill </s>
<s> 

as weak as water replied <abvr> sikes with an imprecation on his eyes
and limbs </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>  lend us a hand and let me get off this thundering
bed anyhow </s>
<s> 

illness had not improved <abvr> sikess temper </s>
<s>  for as the girl raised
him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her
awkwardness and struck her </s>
<s> 

whining are you </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   dont stand snivelling there </s>
<s> 
if you cant do anything better than that cut off altogether </s>
<s>   dye
hear me </s>
<s> 

i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a
laugh </s>
<s>   what fancy have you got in your head now </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  youve thought better of it have you </s>
<s>  growled sikes marking the
tear which trembled in her eye </s>
<s>   all the better for you you have </s>
<s> 

why you dont mean to say youd be hard upon me tonight bill
said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   why not </s>
<s> 

such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans
tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even
to her voice </s>
<s>  such a number of nights as ive been patient with you
nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child </s>
<s>  and this the
first that ive seen you like yourself </s>
<s>  you wouldnt have served me as
you did just now if youd thought of that would you </s>
<s>   come come </s>
<s>  say
you wouldnt </s>
<s> 

well then rejoined <abvr> sikes i wouldnt </s>
<s>   why damme now the
girlss whining again </s>
<s> 

its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair </s>
<s>  dont
you seem to mind me </s>
<s>   itll soon be over </s>
<s> 

whatll be over </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> sikes in a savage voice </s>
<s>  what foolery
are you up to now again </s>
<s>   get up and bustle about and dont come
over me with your womans nonsense </s>
<s> 

at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was
delivered would have had the desired effect </s>
<s>  but the girl being really
weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and
fainted before <abvr> sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his
threats </s>
<s>   not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon
emergency </s>
<s>  for miss nancys hysterics were usually of that violent kind
which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  sikes tried a little blasphemy </s>
<s>  and finding that mode of treatment
wholly ineffectual called for assistance </s>
<s> 

whats the matter here my dear </s>
<s>  said fagin looking in </s>
<s> 

lend a hand to the girl cant you </s>
<s>  replied sikes impatiently </s>
<s>  dont
stand chattering and grinning at me </s>
<s> 

with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls
assistance while <abvr> john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who
had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on
the floor a bundle with which he was laden </s>
<s>  and snatching a bottle from
the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels uncorked
it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents
down the patients throat </s>
<s>   previously taking a taste himself to
prevent mistakes </s>
<s> 

give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said <abvr>
dawkins </s>
<s>  and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the
petticuts </s>
<s> 

these united restoratives administered with great energy </s>
<s>  especially
that department consigned to master bates who appeared to consider his
share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry </s>
<s>   were not
long in producing the desired effect </s>
<s>   the girl gradually recovered her
senses </s>
<s>  and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon
the pillow </s>
<s>   leaving <abvr> sikes to confront the new comers in some
astonishment at their unlookedfor appearance </s>
<s> 

why what evil wind has blowed you here </s>
<s>  he asked fagin </s>
<s> 

no evil wind at all my dear for evil winds blow nobody any good </s>
<s>  and
ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see </s>
<s> 
dodger my dear open the bundle </s>
<s>  and give bill the little trifles that
we spent all our money on this morning </s>
<s> 

in compliance with <abvr> fagins request the artful untied this bundle
which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth </s>
<s>  and handed
the articles it contained one by one to charley bates </s>
<s>  who placed
them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and
excellence </s>
<s> 

sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing
to view a huge pasty </s>
<s>  sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender
limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no
occasion to pick em </s>
<s>  half a pound of seven and sixpenny green so
precious strong that if you mix it with biling water itll go nigh to
blow the lid of the teapot off </s>
<s>  a pound and a half of moist sugar that
the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it up to sitch a
pitch of goodnessoh no </s>
<s>   two halfquartern brans </s>
<s>  pound of best
fresh </s>
<s>  piece of double gloster </s>
<s>  and to wind up all some of the
richest sort you ever lushed </s>
<s> 

uttering this last panegyric master bates produced from one of his
extensive pockets a fullsized winebottle carefully corked </s>
<s>  while
mr </s>
<s>  dawkins at the same instant poured out a wineglassful of raw
spirits from the bottle he carried </s>
<s>   which the invalid tossed down his
throat without a moments hesitation </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said fagin rubbing his hands with great satisfaction </s>
<s>  youll
do bill </s>
<s>  youll do now </s>
<s> 

do </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  i might have been done for twenty times
over afore youd have done anything to help me </s>
<s>   what do you mean by
leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you falsehearted
wagabond </s>
<s> 

only hear him boys </s>
<s>  said fagin shrugging his shoulders </s>
<s>  and us
come to bring him all these beautiful things </s>
<s> 

the things is well enough in their way observed <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   a little
soothed as he glanced over the table </s>
<s>  but what have you got to say for
yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health
blunt and everything else </s>
<s>  and take no more notice of me all this
mortal time than if i was that ere dog </s>
<s> drive him down charley </s>
<s> 

i never see such a jolly dog as that cried master bates doing as he
was desired </s>
<s>   smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market </s>
<s> 
hed make his fortun on the stage that dog would and rewive the
drayma besides </s>
<s> 

hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed </s>
<s>  still
growling angrily </s>
<s>   what have you got to say for yourself you withered
old fence eh </s>
<s> 

i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied
the jew </s>
<s> 

and what about the other fortnight </s>
<s>  demanded sikes </s>
<s>   what about the
other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his
hole </s>
<s> 

i couldnt help it bill </s>
<s>   i cant go into a long explanation before
company </s>
<s>  but i couldnt help it upon my honour </s>
<s> 

upon your what </s>
<s>  growled sikes with excessive disgust </s>
<s>  here </s>
<s>  cut me
off a piece of that pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out
of my mouth or itll choke me dead </s>
<s> 

dont be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively </s>
<s>  i have
never forgot you bill </s>
<s>  never once </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin </s>
<s> 
youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that i have laid
shivering and burning here </s>
<s>  and bill was to do this </s>
<s>  and bill was to do
that </s>
<s>  and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well </s>
<s> 
and was quite poor enough for your work </s>
<s>  if it hadnt been for the
girl i might have died </s>
<s> 

there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word </s>
<s> 
if it hadnt been for the girl </s>
<s>   who but poor ould fagin was the means
of your having such a handy girl about you </s>
<s> 

he says true enough there </s>
<s>  said nancy coming hastily forward </s>
<s>  let
him be </s>
<s>  let him be </s>
<s> 

nancys appearance gave a new turn to the conversation </s>
<s>  for the boys
receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with
liquor </s>
<s>  of which however she took very sparingly </s>
<s>  while fagin
assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought <abvr> sikes into a
better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant
banter </s>
<s>  and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough
jokes which after repeated applications to the spiritbottle he
condescended to make </s>
<s> 

its all very well said <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  but i must have some blunt from
you tonight </s>
<s> 

i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew </s>
<s> 

then youve got lots at home retorted sikes </s>
<s>  and i must have some
from there </s>
<s> 

lots </s>
<s>  cried fagin holding up is hands </s>
<s>   i havent so much as
would

i dont know how much youve got and i dare say you hardly know
yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes </s>
<s> 
but i must have some tonight </s>
<s>  and thats flat </s>
<s> 

well well said fagin with a sigh ill send the artful round
presently </s>
<s> 

you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  the artfuls a
deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get
dodged by traps and so be perwented or anything for an excuse if you
put him up to it </s>
<s>   nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all
sure </s>
<s>  and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone </s>
<s> 

after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence </s>
<s>  protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with </s>
<s>  <abvr> sikes sullenly
remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must accompany him home </s>
<s> 
with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard </s>
<s>   the
jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homeward
attended by nancy and the boys </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes meanwhile flinging himself
on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the
young ladys return </s>
<s> 

in due course they arrived at fagins abode where they found toby
crackit and <abvr> chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage
which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and
with it his fifteenth and last sixpence </s>
<s>  much to the amusement of his
young friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found
relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and
mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat
to go </s>
<s> 

has nobody been toby </s>
<s>  asked fagin </s>
<s> 

not a living leg answered <abvr> crackit pulling up his collar </s>
<s>  its
been as dull as swipes </s>
<s>   you ought to stand something handsome fagin
to recompense me for keeping house so long </s>
<s>  damme im as flat as a
juryman </s>
<s>  and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt
had the good natur to amuse this youngster </s>
<s>   horrid dull im blessed
if i ant </s>
<s> 

with these and other ejaculations of the same kind <abvr> toby crackit
swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with
a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly
beneath the consideration of a man of his figure </s>
<s>  this done he
swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that
mr </s>
<s>  chitling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots
till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his
acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he
didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger </s>
<s> 

wot a rum chap you are tom </s>
<s>  said master bates highly amused by this
declaration </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   am i fagin </s>
<s> 

a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the
shoulder and winking to his other pupils </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> crackit is a heavy swell </s>
<s>  ant he fagin </s>
<s>  asked tom </s>
<s> 

no doubt at all of that my dear </s>
<s> 

and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance </s>
<s>  ant it
fagin </s>
<s>  pursued tom </s>
<s> 

very much so indeed my dear </s>
<s>   theyre only jealous tom because he
wont give it to them </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  cried tom triumphantly thats where it is </s>
<s>   he has cleaned me
out </s>
<s>   but i can go and earn some more when i like </s>
<s>  cant i fagin </s>
<s> 

to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom </s>
<s>  so make up
your loss at once and dont lose any more time </s>
<s>   dodger </s>
<s>  charley </s>
<s> 
its time you were on the lay </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   its near ten and nothing done
yet </s>
<s> 

in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their
hats and left the room </s>
<s>  the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging
as they went in many witticisms at the expense of <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>  in
whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very
conspicuous or peculiar </s>
<s>   inasmuch as there are a great number of
spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than <abvr>
chitling for being seen in good society </s>
<s>   and a great number of fine
gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their
reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit </s>
<s> 

now said fagin when they had left the room ill go and get you
that cash nancy </s>
<s>   this is only the key of a little cupboard where i
keep a few odd things the boys get my dear </s>
<s>   i never lock up my money
for ive got none to lock up my dearha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> none to lock up </s>
<s> 
its a poor trade nancy and no thanks </s>
<s>  but im fond of seeing the
young people about me </s>
<s>  and i bear it all i bear it all </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s>  he
said hastily concealing the key in his breast </s>
<s>  whos that </s>
<s>   listen </s>
<s> 

the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared
in no way interested in the arrival </s>
<s>  or to care whether the person
whoever he was came or went </s>
<s>   until the murmur of a mans voice
reached her ears </s>
<s>   the instant she caught the sound she tore off her
bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under
the table </s>
<s>  the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered
a complaint of the heat </s>
<s>   in a tone of languor that contrasted very
remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action </s>
<s>   which
however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at
the time </s>
<s> 

bah </s>
<s>  he whispered as though nettled by the interruption </s>
<s>  its the
man i expected before </s>
<s>  hes coming downstairs </s>
<s>   not a word about the
money while hes here nance </s>
<s>   he wont stop long </s>
<s>   not ten minutes my
dear </s>
<s> 

laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to
the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without </s>
<s>   he
reached it at the same moment as the visitor who coming hastily into
the room was close upon the girl before he observed her </s>
<s> 

it was monks </s>
<s> 

only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew
back on beholding a stranger </s>
<s>   dont move nancy </s>
<s> 

the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of
careless levity withdrew her eyes </s>
<s>  but as he turned towards fagin she
stole another look </s>
<s>  so keen and searching and full of purpose that if
there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly
have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person </s>
<s> 

any news </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s> 

great </s>
<s> 

andandgood </s>
<s>  asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex
the other man by being too sanguine </s>
<s> 

not bad any way replied monks with a smile </s>
<s>   i have been prompt
enough this time </s>
<s>   let me have a word with you </s>
<s> 

the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room
although she could see that monks was pointing to her </s>
<s>   the jew </s>
<s> 
perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money if he
endeavoured to get rid of her </s>
<s>   pointed upward and took monks out of
the room </s>
<s> 

not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say
as they went upstairs </s>
<s>   fagin laughed </s>
<s>  and making some reply which did
not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his
companion to the second story </s>
<s> 

before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the
house the girl had slipped off her shoes </s>
<s>  and drawing her gown loosely
over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door
listening with breathless interest </s>
<s>   the moment the noise ceased she
glided from the room </s>
<s>  ascended the stairs with incredible softness and
silence </s>
<s>  and was lost in the gloom above </s>
<s> 

the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more </s>
<s>  the girl
glided back with the same unearthly tread </s>
<s>  and immediately afterwards
the two men were heard descending </s>
<s>   monks went at once into the street </s>
<s> 
and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money </s>
<s>   when he returned
the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone </s>
<s> 

why nance </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the
candle how pale you are </s>
<s> 

pale </s>
<s>  echoed the girl shading her eyes with her hands as if to look
steadily at him </s>
<s> 

quite horrible </s>
<s>   what have you been doing to yourself </s>
<s> 

nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont
know how long and all replied the girl carelessly </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>   let me get
back </s>
<s>  thats a dear </s>
<s> 

with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her
hand </s>
<s>   they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a
goodnight </s>
<s> 

when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep </s>
<s> 
and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue
her way </s>
<s>   suddenly she arose </s>
<s>  and hurrying on in a direction quite
opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened
her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run </s>
<s>   after
completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath </s>
<s>   and as if
suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do
something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears </s>
<s> 

it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full
hopelessness of her condition </s>
<s>  but she turned back </s>
<s>  and hurrying with
nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction </s>
<s>  partly to recover
lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own
thoughts </s>
<s>   soon reached the dwelling where she had left the
housebreaker </s>
<s> 

if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to <abvr> sikes
he did not observe it </s>
<s>  for merely inquiring if she had brought the
money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of
satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the
slumbers which her arrival had interrupted </s>
<s> 

it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so
much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking </s>
<s>  and withal
had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his
temper </s>
<s>  that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical
upon her behaviour and deportment </s>
<s>   that she had all the abstracted and
nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous
step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would
have been obvious to the lynxeyed fagin who would most probably have
taken the alarm at once </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sikes lacking the niceties of
discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than
those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
towards everybody </s>
<s>  and being furthermore in an unusually amiable
condition as has been already observed </s>
<s>  saw nothing unusual in her
demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had
her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been
very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions </s>
<s> 

as that day closed in the girls excitement increased </s>
<s>  and when night
came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink
himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire
in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water
with his gin to render it less inflammatory </s>
<s>  and had pushed his glass
towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when
these symptoms first struck him </s>
<s> 

why burn my body </s>
<s>  said the man raising himself on his hands as he
stared the girl in the face </s>
<s>   you look like a corpse come to life
again </s>
<s>   whats the matter </s>
<s> 

matter </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   nothing </s>
<s>   what do you look at me so hard
for </s>
<s> 

what foolery is this </s>
<s>  demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and
shaking her roughly </s>
<s>   what is it </s>
<s>   what do you mean </s>
<s>   what are you
thinking of </s>
<s> 

of many things bill replied the girl shivering and as she did so
pressing her hands upon her eyes </s>
<s>   but lord </s>
<s>   what odds in that </s>
<s> 

the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed
to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look
which had preceded them </s>
<s> 

i tell you wot it is said sikes </s>
<s>  if you havent caught the fever
and got it comin on now theres something more than usual in the
wind and something dangerous too </s>
<s>   youre not agoing to </s>
<s>   no
damme </s>
<s>  you wouldnt do that </s>
<s> 

do what </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

there aint said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the
words to himself </s>
<s>  there aint a stauncherhearted gal going or id
have cut her throat three months ago </s>
<s>   shes got the fever coming on </s>
<s> 
thats it </s>
<s> 

fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the
bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic </s>
<s> 
the girl jumped up with great alacrity </s>
<s>  poured it quickly out but
with her back towards him </s>
<s>  and held the vessel to his lips while he
drank off the contents </s>
<s> 

now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own
face </s>
<s>  or ill alter it so that you wont know it agin when you do want
it </s>
<s> 

the girl obeyed </s>
<s>   sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the
pillow </s>
<s>  turning his eyes upon her face </s>
<s>   they closed </s>
<s>  opened again </s>
<s> 
closed once more </s>
<s>  again opened </s>
<s>   he shifted his position restlessly </s>
<s> 
and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as
often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about
him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of
rising into a deep and heavy sleep </s>
<s>   the grasp of his hand relaxed </s>
<s> 
the upraised arm fell languidly by his side </s>
<s>  and he lay like one in a
profound trance </s>
<s> 

the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose
from the bedside </s>
<s>   i may be too late even now </s>
<s> 

she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl </s>
<s>   looking fearfully
round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she
expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikess heavy hand upon
her shoulder </s>
<s>  then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the
robbers lips </s>
<s>  and then opening and closing the roomdoor with
noiseless touch hurried from the house </s>
<s> 

a watchman was crying halfpast nine down a dark passage through which
she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare </s>
<s> 

has it long gone the halfhour </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man </s>
<s>  raising his
lantern to her face </s>
<s> 

and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy </s>
<s> 
brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street </s>
<s> 

many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards
the westend of london </s>
<s>   the clock struck ten increasing her
impatience </s>
<s>   she tore along the narrow pavement </s>
<s>   elbowing the
passengers from side to side </s>
<s>  and darting almost under the horses
heads crossed crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly
watching their opportunity to do the like </s>
<s> 

the woman is mad </s>
<s>  said the people turning to look after her as she
rushed away </s>
<s> 

when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were
comparatively deserted </s>
<s>  and here her headlong progress excited a still
greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past </s>
<s>   some
quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening
at such an unusual rate </s>
<s>  and a few made head upon her and looked back
surprised at her undiminished speed </s>
<s>  but they fell off one by one </s>
<s>  and
when she neared her place of destination she was alone </s>
<s> 

it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park </s>
<s> 
as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided
her to the spot the clock struck eleven </s>
<s>   she had loitered for a few
paces as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance </s>
<s>  but the
sound determined her and she stepped into the hall </s>
<s>   the porters seat
was vacant </s>
<s>   she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced
towards the stairs </s>
<s> 

now young woman </s>
<s>  said a smartlydressed female looking out from a
door behind her who do you want here </s>
<s> 

a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl </s>
<s> 

a lady </s>
<s>  was the reply accompanied with a scornful look </s>
<s>  what lady </s>
<s> 

miss maylie said nancy </s>
<s> 

the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied
only by a look of virtuous disdain </s>
<s>  and summoned a man to answer her </s>
<s> 
to him nancy repeated her request </s>
<s> 

what name am i to say </s>
<s>  asked the waiter </s>
<s> 

its of no use saying any replied nancy </s>
<s> 

nor business </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s> 

no nor that neither rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   i must see the lady </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said the man pushing her towards the door </s>
<s>   none of this </s>
<s> 
take yourself off </s>
<s> 

i shall be carried out if i go </s>
<s>  said the girl violently </s>
<s>  and i can
make that a job that two of you wont like to do </s>
<s>   isnt there anybody
here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried
for a poor wretch like me </s>
<s> 

this appeal produced an effect on a goodtemperedfaced mancook who
with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward
to interfere </s>
<s> 

take it up for her joe </s>
<s>  cant you </s>
<s>  said this person </s>
<s> 

whats the good </s>
<s>  replied the man </s>
<s>   you dont suppose the young lady
will see such as her </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

this allusion to nancys doubtful character raised a vast quantity of
chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great
fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex </s>
<s>  and strongly
advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel </s>
<s> 

do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again </s>
<s> 
but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for
god almightys sake </s>
<s> 

the softhearted cook added his intercession and the result was that
the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery </s>
<s> 

whats it to be </s>
<s>  said the man with one foot on the stairs </s>
<s> 

that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone said
nancy </s>
<s>  and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to
say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned
out of doors as an impostor </s>
<s> 

i say said the man youre coming it strong </s>

you give the message said the girl firmly </s>

answer </s>
<s> 

the man ran upstairs </s>
<s>   nancy remained pale and almost breathless
listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn
of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific </s>
<s>  and of which they
became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman
was to walk upstairs </s>
<s> 

its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid </s>
<s> 

brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the
second </s>
<s> 

the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of </s>
<s> 
and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful </s>
<s>  with which
the dianas concluded </s>
<s> 

regardless of all this </s>

followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber
lighted by a lamp from the ceiling </s>

chapter xl

a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber

the girls life had been squandered in the streets and among the most
noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the
womans original nature left in her still </s>
<s>  and when she heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered
and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
moment contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame
and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with
whom she had sought this interview </s>
<s> 

but struggling with these better feelings was pridethe vice of the
lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and
selfassured </s>
<s>   the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the
fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the
jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itselfeven
this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the
womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected
her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated so
many many traces when a very child </s>
<s> 

she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl </s>
<s>  then bending
them on the ground she tossed her head with affected carelessness as
she said </s>
<s> 

its a hard matter to get to see you lady </s>
<s>   if i had taken offence
and gone away as many would have done youd have been sorry for it
one day and not without reason either </s>
<s> 

i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you replied rose </s>
<s> 
do not think of that </s>
<s>   tell me why you wished to see me </s>
<s>  i am the
person you inquired for </s>
<s> 

the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the
absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl
completely by surprise and she burst into tears </s>
<s> 

oh lady lady </s>
<s>  she said clasping her hands passionately before her
face if there was more like you there would be fewer like methere
wouldthere would </s>
<s> 

sit down said rose earnestly </s>
<s>   if you are in poverty or affliction
i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i cani shall indeed </s>
<s>   sit
down </s>
<s> 

let me stand lady said the girl still weeping and do not speak
to me so kindly till you know me better </s>
<s>   it is growing late </s>
<s> 
isisthat door shut </s>
<s> 

yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance
in case she should require it </s>
<s>   why </s>
<s> 

because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of
others in your hands </s>
<s>   i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to
old fagins on the night he went out from the house in pentonville </s>
<s> 

you </s>

<s> 

i lady </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   i am the infamous creature you have
heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first
moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets
have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so
help me god </s>
<s>   do not mind shrinking openly from me lady </s>
<s>   i am younger
than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it </s>
<s>  the
poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement </s>
<s> 

what dreadful things are these </s>
<s>  said rose involuntarily falling from
her strange companion </s>
<s> 

thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you
had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you
were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness
andandsomething worse than allas i have been from my cradle </s>
<s>   i
may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will
be my deathbed </s>
<s> 

i pity you </s>
<s>  said rose in a broken voice </s>
<s>   it wrings my heart to
hear you </s>
<s> 

heaven bless you for your goodness </s>
<s>  rejoined the girl </s>
<s>  if you knew
what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed </s>
<s>  but i have stolen away
from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to
tell you what i have overheard </s>
<s>   do you know a man named monks </s>
<s> 

no said rose </s>
<s> 

he knows you replied the girl </s>
<s>  and knew you were here for it was
by hearing him tell the place that i found you out </s>
<s> 

i never heard the name said rose </s>
<s> 

then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i
more than thought before </s>
<s>   some time ago and soon after oliver was put
into your house on the night of the robbery isuspecting this
manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark </s>
<s> 
i found out from what i heard that monksthe man i asked you about
you know

yes said rose i understand </s>
<s> 

that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidently with two of
our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be
the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out
why </s>
<s>   a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he
should have a certain sum </s>
<s>  and he was to have more for making him a
thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own </s>
<s> 

for what purpose </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of
finding out said the girl </s>
<s>  and there are not many people besides me
that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery </s>
<s>   but
i did </s>
<s>  and i saw him no more till last night </s>
<s> 

and what occurred then </s>
<s> 

ill tell you lady </s>
<s>   last night he came again </s>
<s>   again they went
upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray
me again listened at the door </s>
<s>   the first words i heard monks say were
these </s>
<s>   so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of
the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is
rotting in her coffin </s>
<s>   they laughed and talked of his success in
doing this </s>
<s>  and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild
said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed
rather have had it the other way </s>
<s>  for what a game it would have been
to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him
through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital
felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit
of him besides </s>
<s> 

what is all this </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s> 

the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl </s>
<s> 
then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to
yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life
without bringing his own neck in danger he would </s>
<s>  but as he couldnt
hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life </s>
<s>  and if he
took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet </s>
<s>  in
short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as
ill contrive for my young brother oliver </s>
<s> 

his brother </s>
<s>  exclaimed rose </s>
<s> 

those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had
scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes
haunted her perpetually </s>
<s>   and more </s>
<s>  when he spoke of you and the other
lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against
him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said
there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds
of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who
your twolegged spaniel was </s>
<s> 

you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this
was said in earnest </s>
<s> 

he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did replied the
girl shaking her head </s>
<s>   he is an earnest man when his hatred is up </s>
<s> 
i know many who do worse things </s>
<s>  but id rather listen to them all a
dozen times than to that monks once </s>
<s>   it is growing late and i have
to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as
this </s>
<s>   i must get back quickly </s>
<s> 

but what can i do </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s>   to what use can i turn this
communication without you </s>
<s>   back </s>
<s>   why do you wish to return to
companions you paint in such terrible colors </s>
<s>   if you repeat this
information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the
next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an
hours delay </s>
<s> 

i wish to go back said the girl </s>
<s>   i must go back becausehow can
i tell such things to an innocent lady like you </s>
<s> because among the men
i have told you of there is one </s>
<s>  the most desperate among them all </s>
<s> 
that i cant leave </s>
<s>   no not even to be saved from the life i am
leading now </s>
<s> 

your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose </s>
<s> 
your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard </s>
<s> 
your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say </s>
<s>  your
evident contrition and sense of shame </s>
<s>  all lead me to believe that you
might yet be reclaimed </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  said the earnest girl folding her hands
as the tears coursed down her face do not turn a deaf ear to the
entreaties of one of your own sex </s>
<s>  the firstthe first i do believe
who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion </s>
<s>   do hear
my words and let me save you yet for better things </s>
<s> 

lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady
you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and
if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of
sin and sorrow </s>
<s>  but it is too late it is too late </s>
<s> 

it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement </s>
<s> 

it is cried the girl writhing in agony of her mind </s>
<s>  i cannot leave
him now </s>
<s>   i could not be his death </s>

why should you be </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

nothing could save him cried the girl </s>
<s>   if i told others what i
have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die </s>
<s> 
he is the boldest and has been so cruel </s>
<s> 

is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can
resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue </s>
<s>   it is
madness </s>
<s> 

i dont know what it is answered the girl </s>
<s>  i only know that it is
so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and
wretched as myself </s>
<s>   i must go back </s>
<s>   whether it is gods wrath for the
wrong i have done i do not know </s>
<s>  but i am drawn back to him through
every suffering and ill usage </s>
<s>  and i should be i believe if i knew
that i was to die by his hand at last </s>
<s> 

what am i to do </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s>   i should not let you depart from me
thus </s>
<s> 

you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising </s>
<s> 
you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness
and forced no promise from you as i might have done </s>
<s> 

of what use then is the communication you have made </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s> 
this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me
benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve </s>
<s> 

you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl </s>
<s> 

but where can i find you again when it is necessary </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s>   i
do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will
you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time </s>
<s> 

will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and
come alone or with the only other person that knows it </s>
<s>  and that i
shall not be watched or followed </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

i promise you solemnly answered rose </s>
<s> 

every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said
the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am
alive </s>
<s> 

stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly
towards the door </s>
<s>   think once again on your own condition and the
opportunity you have of escaping from it </s>
<s>   you have a claim on me </s>
<s>   not
only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost
almost beyond redemption </s>
<s>   will you return to this gang of robbers and
to this man when a word can save you </s>
<s>   what fascination is it that can
take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  is
there no chord in your heart that i can touch </s>
<s>   is there nothing left
to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation </s>
<s> 

when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the
girl steadily give away your hearts love will carry you all
lengthseven such as you who have home friends other admirers
everything to fill them </s>
<s>   when such as i who have no certain roof but
the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital
nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place
that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to
cure us </s>
<s>   pity us ladypity us for having only one feeling of the
woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a
comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering </s>
<s> 

you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which
may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet
again </s>
<s> 

not a penny replied the girl waving her hand </s>
<s> 

do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said
rose stepping gently forward </s>
<s>   i wish to serve you indeed </s>
<s> 

you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands
if you could take my life at once </s>
<s>  for i have felt more grief to think
of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be
something not to die in the hell in which i have lived </s>
<s>   god bless you
sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought
shame on mine </s>
<s> 

thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away </s>
<s> 
while rose maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which
had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank
into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts </s>
<s> 



chapter xli

containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like
misfortunes seldom come alone

her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty </s>
<s>  while
she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the
confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed
had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl </s>
<s>   her words and
manner had touched rose maylies heart </s>
<s>  and mingled with her love for
her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour
was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope </s>
<s> 

they purposed remaining in london only three days prior to departing
for some weeks to a distant part of the coast </s>
<s>   it was now midnight of
the first day </s>
<s>   what course of action could she determine upon which
could be adopted in eightandforty hours </s>
<s>  or how could she postpone
the journey without exciting suspicion </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne was with them and would be for the next two days </s>
<s>  but
rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans
impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first
explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of
olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her
representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no
experienced person </s>
<s>   these were all reasons for the greatest caution
and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to <abvr> maylie
whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the
worthy doctor on the subject </s>
<s>   as to resorting to any legal adviser
even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of
for the same reason </s>
<s>   once the thought occurred to her of seeking
assistance from harry </s>
<s>  but this awakened the recollection of their last
parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back whenthe
tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflectionhe
might have by this time learnt to forget her and to be happier away </s>
<s> 

disturbed by these different reflections </s>
<s>  inclining now to one course
and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive
consideration presented itself to her mind </s>
<s>  rose passed a sleepless and
anxious night </s>
<s>   after more communing with herself next day she arrived
at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry </s>
<s> 

if it be painful to him she thought to come back here how painful
it will be to me </s>
<s>   but perhaps he will not come </s>
<s>  he may write or he
may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when
he went away </s>
<s>   i hardly thought he would </s>
<s>  but it was better for us
both </s>
<s>   and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the
very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep </s>
<s> 

she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and
had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without
writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the
streets with <abvr> giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such
breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new
cause of alarm </s>
<s> 

what makes you look so flurried </s>
<s>  asked rose advancing to meet him </s>
<s> 

i hardly know how </s>
<s>  i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy </s>
<s> 
oh dear </s>
<s>   to think that i should see him at last and you should be
able to know that i have told you the truth </s>
<s> 

i never thought you had told us anything but the truth said rose
soothing him </s>
<s>   but what is this </s>
<s> of whom do you speak </s>
<s> 

i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to
articulate the gentleman who was so good to memr </s>
<s>  brownlow that we
have so often talked about </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight
and going into a house </s>
<s>   i didnt speak to himi couldnt speak to
him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go
up to him </s>
<s>   but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they
said he did </s>
<s>   look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here
it is </s>
<s>  heres where he livesim going there directly </s>
<s>   oh dear me
dear me </s>
<s>   what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak
again </s>
<s> 

with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many
other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was
craven street in the strand </s>
<s>   she very soon determined upon turning
the discovery to account </s>
<s> 

quick </s>
<s>  she said </s>
<s>   tell them to fetch a hackneycoach and be ready
to go with me </s>
<s>   i will take you there directly without a minutes loss
of time </s>
<s>   i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour
and be ready as soon as you are </s>
<s> 

oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five
minutes they were on their way to craven street </s>
<s>   when they arrived
there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the
old gentleman to receive him </s>
<s>  and sending up her card by the servant
requested to see <abvr> brownlow on very pressing business </s>
<s>   the servant
soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs </s>
<s>  and following him
into an upper room miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman
of benevolent appearance in a bottlegreen coat </s>
<s>   at no great distance
from whom was seated another old gentleman in nankeen breeches and
gaiters </s>
<s>  who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting
with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin
propped thereupon </s>
<s> 

dear me said the gentleman in the bottlegreen coat hastily rising
with great politeness i beg your pardon young ladyi imagined it
was some importunate person whoi beg you will excuse me </s>
<s>   be seated
pray </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow i believe sir </s>
<s>  said rose glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken </s>
<s> 

that is my name said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   this is my friend <abvr>
grimwig </s>
<s>   grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes </s>
<s> 

i believe interposed miss maylie that at this period of our
interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away </s>
<s> 
if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i
wish to speak to you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow inclined his head </s>
<s>   <abvr> grimwig who had made one very
stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and
dropped into it again </s>
<s> 

i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally
embarrassed </s>
<s>  but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest
in hearing of him again </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

oliver twist you knew him as replied rose </s>
<s> 

the words no sooner escaped her lips than <abvr> grimwig who had been
affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with
a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his
features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder and indulged
in a prolonged and vacant stare </s>
<s>  then as if ashamed of having betrayed
so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into
his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long
deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air
but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  browlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not
expressed in the same eccentric manner </s>
<s>   he drew his chair nearer to
miss maylies and said

do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which
nobody else knows anything </s>
<s>  and if you have it in your power to produce
any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once
induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in
possession of it </s>
<s> 

a bad one </s>
<s>   ill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled <abvr>
grimwig speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle
of his face </s>
<s> 

he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose
colouring </s>
<s>  and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do
honour to many who have numbered his days six times over </s>
<s> 

im only sixtyone said <abvr> grimwig with the same rigid face </s>
<s>  and
as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i
dont see the application of that remark </s>
<s> 

do not heed my friend miss maylie said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  he does not
mean what he says </s>
<s> 

yes he does growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

no he does not said <abvr> brownlow obviously rising in wrath as he
spoke </s>
<s> 

hell eat his head if he doesnt growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said <abvr>
brownlow </s>
<s> 

and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded <abvr>
grimwig knocking his stick upon the floor </s>
<s> 

having gone thus far the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and
afterwards shook hands according to their invariable custom </s>
<s> 

now miss maylie said <abvr> brownlow to return to the subject in
which your humanity is so much interested </s>
<s>   will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child </s>
<s>   allowing me to promise that
i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since
i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had
imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob
me has been considerably shaken </s>
<s> 

rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a
few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left <abvr>
brownlows house </s>
<s>  reserving nancys information for that gentlemans
private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow
for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former
benefactor and friend </s>
<s> 

thank god </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   this is great happiness to me
great happiness </s>
<s>   but you have not told me where he is now miss
maylie </s>
<s>   you must pardon my finding fault with youbut why not have
brought him </s>
<s> 

he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose </s>
<s> 

at this door </s>
<s>  cried the old gentleman </s>
<s>   with which he hurried out of
the room down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach
without another word </s>
<s> 

when the roomdoor closed behind him <abvr> grimwig lifted up his head
and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot
described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and
the table </s>
<s>  sitting in it all the time </s>
<s>   after performing this
evolution he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room
at least a dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed
her without the slightest preface </s>

hush </s>
<s>  he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
proceeding </s>
<s>   dont be afraid </s>
<s>   im old enough to be your grandfather </s>
<s> 
youre a sweet girl </s>
<s>   i like you </s>
<s>   here they are </s>
<s> 

in fact as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
seat <abvr> brownlow returned accompanied by oliver whom <abvr> grimwig
received very graciously </s>
<s>  and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf
rose maylie would have been well repaid </s>
<s> 

there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said
mr </s>
<s>  brownlow ringing the bell </s>
<s>   send <abvr> bedwin here if you please </s>
<s> 

the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch </s>
<s>  and
dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders </s>
<s> 

why you get blinder every day bedwin said <abvr> brownlow rather
testily </s>
<s> 

well that i do sir replied the old lady </s>
<s>   peoples eyes at my
time of life dont improve with age sir </s>
<s> 

i could have told you that rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  but put on your
glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will
you </s>
<s> 

the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles </s>
<s>  but
olivers patience was not proof against this new trial </s>
<s>  and yielding to
his first impulse he sprang into her arms </s>
<s> 

god be good to me </s>
<s>  cried the old lady embracing him </s>
<s>  it is my
innocent boy </s>
<s> 

my dear old nurse </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s> 

he would come backi knew he would said the old lady holding him
in her arms </s>
<s>   how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is
dressed again </s>
<s>   where have you been this long long while </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  the
same sweet face but not so pale </s>
<s>  the same soft eye but not so sad </s>
<s>   i
have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every
day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone
since i was a lightsome young creature </s>
<s>   running on thus and now
holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to
her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul
laughed and wept upon his neck by turns </s>
<s> 

leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure <abvr> brownlow led
the way into another room </s>
<s>  and there heard from rose a full narration
of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise
and perplexity </s>
<s>   rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in
her friend <abvr> losberne in the first instance </s>
<s>   the old gentleman
considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold
solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself </s>
<s>   to afford him an
early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged
that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and
that in the meantime <abvr> maylie should be cautiously informed of all
that had occurred </s>
<s>   these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver
returned home </s>
<s> 

rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath </s>
<s> 
nancys history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a
shower of mingled threats and execrations </s>
<s>  threatened to make her the
first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff </s>
<s> 
and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the
assistance of those worthies </s>
<s>   and doubtless he would in this first
outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments
consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in
part by corresponding violence on the side of <abvr> brownlow who was
himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and
representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his
hotbrained purpose </s>
<s> 

then what the devil is to be done </s>
<s>  said the impetuous doctor when
they had rejoined the two ladies </s>
<s>   are we to pass a vote of thanks to
all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred
pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some
slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver </s>
<s> 

not exactly that rejoined <abvr> brownlow laughing </s>
<s>  but we must
proceed gently and with great care </s>
<s> 

gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor </s>
<s>   id send them one and
all to

never mind where interposed <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   but reflect whether
sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view </s>
<s> 

what object </s>
<s>  asked the doctor </s>
<s> 

simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the
inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently
deprived </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> losberne cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s> 
i almost forgot that </s>
<s> 

you see pursued <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  placing this poor girl entirely out
of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these
scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should
we bring about </s>
<s> 

hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the
doctor and transporting the rest </s>
<s> 

very good replied <abvr> brownlow smiling </s>
<s>  but no doubt they will
bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step
in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interestor at least to
olivers which is the same thing </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s>  inquired the doctor </s>
<s> 

thus </s>
<s>   it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in
getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man
monks upon his knees </s>
<s>   that can only be done by stratagem and by
catching him when he is not surrounded by these people </s>
<s>   for suppose
he were apprehended we have no proof against him </s>
<s>   he is not even so
far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang
in any of their robberies </s>
<s>  if he were not discharged it is very
unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being
committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond </s>
<s>  and of course ever
afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as
well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot </s>
<s> 

then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether
you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
considered binding </s>
<s>  a promise made with the best and kindest
intentions but really

do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said <abvr>
brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak </s>
<s>  the promise
shall be kept </s>
<s>   i dont think it will in the slightest degree
interfere with our proceedings </s>
<s>   but before we can resolve upon any
precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl </s>
<s>  to
ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the
understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law </s>
<s> 
or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an
account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us
to identify him </s>
<s>   she cannot be seen until next sunday night </s>
<s>  this is
tuesday </s>
<s>   i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly
quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself </s>
<s> 

although <abvr> losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving
a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course
occurred to him just then </s>
<s>  and as both rose and <abvr> maylie sided very
strongly with <abvr> brownlow that gentlemans proposition was carried
unanimously </s>
<s> 

i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grimwig </s>
<s>   he
is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material
assistance to us </s>
<s>  i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted
the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of
course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not
you must determine for yourselves </s>
<s> 

i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in
mine said the doctor </s>
<s> 

we must put it to the vote replied <abvr> brownlow who may he be </s>
<s> 

that ladys son and this young ladysvery old friend said the
doctor motioning towards <abvr> maylie and concluding with an
expressive glance at her niece </s>
<s> 

rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this
motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority </s>
<s>  and harry maylie and
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig were accordingly added to the committee </s>
<s> 

we stay in town of course said <abvr> maylie while there remains
the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
success </s>
<s>   i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the
object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to
remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that
any hope remains </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   and as i see on the faces about me a
disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to
corroborate olivers tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me
stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may
deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story </s>
<s>   believe
me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite
hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and
disappointments already quite numerous enough </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   supper has been
announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will
have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company
and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the
world </s>
<s> 

with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to <abvr> maylie and
escorted her into the supperroom </s>
<s>   <abvr> losberne followed leading
rose </s>
<s>  and the council was for the present effectually broken up </s>

chapter xlii

an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius
becomes a public character in the metropolis

upon the night when nancy having lulled <abvr> sikes to sleep hurried on
her selfimposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london
by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that
this history should bestow some attention </s>
<s> 

they were a man and woman </s>
<s>  or perhaps they would be better described as
a male and female </s>
<s>   for the former was one of those longlimbed
knockkneed shambling bony people to whom it is difficult to assign
any precise agelooking as they do when they are yet boys like
undergrown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys </s>
<s>   the
woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been
to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back </s>
<s> 
her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely
dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel
wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough </s>
<s>   this
circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual
extent enabled him with much ease to keep some halfdozen paces in
advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an
impatient jerk of the head </s>
<s>   as if reproaching her tardiness and
urging her to greater exertion </s>
<s> 

thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any
object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider
passage for the mailcoaches which were whirling out of town until
they passed through highgate archway </s>
<s>  when the foremost traveller
stopped and called impatiently to his companion

come on cant yer </s>
<s>   what a lazybones yer are charlotte </s>
<s> 

its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost
breathless with fatigue </s>
<s> 

heavy </s>
<s>   what are yer talking about </s>
<s>   what are yer made for </s>
<s>  rejoined
the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the
other shoulder </s>
<s>   oh there yer are resting again </s>
<s>  well if yer aint
enough to tire anybodys patience out i dont know what is </s>
<s> 

is it much farther </s>
<s>  asked the woman resting herself against a bank
and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face </s>
<s> 

much farther </s>
<s>   yer as good as there said the longlegged tramper
pointing out before him </s>
<s>   look there </s>
<s>   those are the lights of london </s>
<s> 

theyre a good two mile off at least said the woman despondingly </s>
<s> 

never mind whether theyre two mile off or twenty said noah
claypole </s>
<s>  for he it was </s>
<s>  but get up and come on or ill kick yer and
so i give yer notice </s>
<s> 

as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road
while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution
the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his
side </s>
<s> 

where do you mean to stop for the night noah </s>
<s>  she asked after they
had walked a few hundred yards </s>
<s> 

how should i know </s>
<s>  replied noah whose temper had been considerably
impaired by walking </s>
<s> 

near i hope said charlotte </s>
<s> 

no not near replied <abvr> claypole </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>   not near </s>
<s>  so dont
think it </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s> 

when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough
without any why or because either replied <abvr> claypole with dignity </s>
<s> 

well you neednt be so cross said his companion </s>
<s> 

a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very
first publichouse outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up
after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart
with handcuffs on said <abvr> claypole in a jeering tone </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   i shall
go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop
till we come to the very outofthewayest house i can set eyes on </s>
<s> 
cod yer may thanks yer stars ive got a head </s>
<s>  for if we hadnt gone
at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yerd
have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady </s>
<s>   and serve yer
right for being a fool </s>
<s> 

i know i aint as cunning as you are replied charlotte </s>
<s>  but dont
put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up </s>
<s>   you
would have been if i had been any way </s>
<s> 

yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte </s>
<s> 

did i keep it </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you
are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm
through his </s>
<s> 

this was indeed the case </s>
<s>  but as it was not <abvr> claypoles habit to
repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be
observed in justice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte
to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be
found on her </s>
<s>   which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his
innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of
escape </s>
<s>   of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of
his motives and they walked on very lovingly together </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this cautious plan <abvr> claypole went on without
halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely
judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that
london began in earnest </s>
<s>   just pausing to observe which appeared the
most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he
crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of
the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and
smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst
that improvement has left in the midst of london </s>
<s> 

through these streets noah claypole walked dragging charlotte after
him </s>
<s>  now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole
external character of some small publichouse </s>
<s>  now jogging on again as
some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his
purpose </s>
<s>   at length he stopped in front of one more humble in
appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen </s>
<s>  and having crossed
over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced
his intention of putting up there for the night </s>
<s> 

so give us the bundle said noah unstrapping it from the womans
shoulders and slinging it over his own </s>
<s>  and dont yer speak except
when yer spoke to </s>
<s>   whats the name of the housethrthree what </s>
<s> 

cripples said charlotte </s>
<s> 

three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too </s>
<s>   now then </s>
<s> 
keep close at my heels and come along </s>
<s>   with these injunctions he
pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house
followed by his companion </s>
<s> 

there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows
on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper </s>
<s>  he stared very hard at
noah and noah stared very hard at him </s>
<s> 

if noah had been attired in his charityboys dress there might have
been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide </s>
<s>  but as he had
discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smockfrock over his
leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting
so much attention in a publichouse </s>
<s> 

is this the three cripples </s>
<s>  asked noah </s>
<s> 

that is the dabe of this ouse replied the jew </s>
<s> 

a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country
recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her
attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and
perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise </s>
<s>   we want to sleep here
tonight </s>
<s> 

ib dot certaid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite </s>
<s> 
but ill idquire </s>
<s> 

show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
while yer inquiring will yer </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s> 

barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting
the required viands before them </s>
<s>  having done which he informed the
travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable
couple to their refreshment </s>
<s> 

now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps
lower so that any person connected with the house undrawing a small
curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the
lastnamed apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only
look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of
being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between
which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but
could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable
distinctness their subject of conversation </s>
<s>   the landlord of the house
had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes
and barney had only just returned from making the communication above
related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into
the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said barney </s>
<s>   stradegers id the next roob </s>
<s> 

strangers </s>
<s>  repeated the old man in a whisper </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   ad rub uds too added barney </s>
<s>   frob the cuttry but subthig in
your way or ib bistaked </s>
<s> 

fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest </s>
<s> 

mounting a stool he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass
from which secret post he could see <abvr> claypole taking cold beef from
the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses
of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his
pleasure </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  he whispered looking round to barney i like that fellows
looks </s>
<s>   hed be of use to us </s>
<s>  he knows how to train the girl already </s>
<s> 
dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em
talklet me hear em </s>
<s> 

he again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the
partition listened attentively </s>
<s>   with a subtle and eager look upon his
face that might have appertained to some old goblin </s>
<s> 

so i mean to be a gentleman said <abvr> claypole kicking out his legs
and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had
arrived too late to hear </s>
<s>  no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a
gentlemans life for me </s>
<s>   and if yer like yer shall be a lady </s>
<s> 

i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte </s>
<s>  but tills
aint to be emptied every day and people to get clear off after it </s>
<s> 

tills be blowed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> claypole </s>
<s>  theres more things besides
tills to be emptied </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  asked his companion </s>
<s> 

pockets womens ridicules houses mailcoaches banks </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
claypole rising with the porter </s>
<s> 

but you cant do all that dear said charlotte </s>
<s> 

i shall look out to get into company with them as can replied noah </s>
<s> 
theyll be able to make us useful some way or another </s>
<s>  why you
yourself are worth fifty women </s>
<s>  i never see such a precious sly and
deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer </s>
<s> 

lor how nice it is to hear yer say so </s>
<s>  exclaimed charlotte
imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face </s>
<s> 

there thatll do </s>
<s>   dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross
with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity </s>
<s>   i
should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of
em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves </s>
<s>   that would suit
me if there was good profit </s>
<s>  and if we could only get in with some
gentleman of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twentypound
note youve gotespecially as we dont very well know how to get rid
of it ourselves </s>
<s> 

after expressing this opinion <abvr> claypole looked into the porterpot
with an aspect of deep wisdom </s>
<s>  and having well shaken its contents
nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught wherewith he
appeared greatly refreshed </s>
<s>   he was meditating another when the sudden
opening of the door and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him </s>
<s> 

the stranger was <abvr> fagin </s>
<s>   and very amiable he looked and a very low
bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest
table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney </s>
<s> 

a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin
rubbing his hands </s>
<s>   from the country i see sir </s>
<s> 

how do yer see that </s>
<s>  asked noah claypole </s>
<s> 

we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing
from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two
bundles </s>
<s> 

yer a sharp feller said noah </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  only hear that charlotte </s>
<s> 

why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew
sinking his voice to a confidential whisper </s>
<s>  and thats the truth </s>
<s> 

fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his
right forefingera gesture which noah attempted to imitate though
not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being
large enough for the purpose </s>
<s>   however <abvr> fagin seemed to interpret
the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and
put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly
manner </s>
<s> 

good stuff that observed <abvr> claypole smacking his lips </s>
<s> 

dear </s>
<s>  said fagin </s>
<s>   a man need be always emptying a till or a
pocket or a womans reticule or a house or a mailcoach or a bank
if he drinks it regularly </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he
fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a
countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror </s>
<s> 

dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 
ha </s>
<s>  it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance </s>
<s>  it was very
lucky it was only me </s>
<s> 

i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs
like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well as he could
under his chair </s>
<s>  it was all her doing </s>
<s>  yerve got it now charlotte
yer know yer have </s>
<s> 

no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin
glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two
bundles </s>
<s>   im in that way myself and i like you for it </s>
<s> 

in what way </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole a little recovering </s>
<s> 

in that way of business rejoined fagin </s>
<s>  and so are the people of
the house </s>
<s>   youve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe
here as you could be </s>
<s>   there is not a safer place in all this town than
is the cripples </s>
<s>  that is when i like to make it so </s>
<s>   and i have taken
a fancy to you and the young woman </s>
<s>  so ive said the word and you may
make your minds easy </s>
<s> 

noah claypoles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but
his body certainly was not </s>
<s>  for he shuffled and writhed about into
various uncouth positions </s>
<s>   eyeing his new friend meanwhile with
mingled fear and suspicion </s>
<s> 

ill tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by
dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements </s>
<s>  i have got a friend
that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right
way where you can take whatever department of the business you think
will suit you best at first and be taught all the others </s>
<s> 

yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah </s>
<s> 

what advantage would it be to me to be anything else </s>
<s>  inquired fagin
shrugging his shoulders </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>   let me have a word with you outside </s>
<s> 

theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting
his legs by gradual degrees abroad again </s>
<s>  shell take the luggage
upstairs the while </s>
<s>   charlotte see to them bundles </s>
<s> 

this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed
without the slightest demur </s>
<s>  and charlotte made the best of her way off
with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out </s>
<s> 

shes kept tolerably well under aint she </s>
<s>  he asked as he resumed
his seat </s>
<s>   in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal </s>
<s> 

quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  youre
a genius my dear </s>
<s> 

why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah </s>
<s>  but
i say shell be back if yer lose time </s>
<s> 

now what do you think </s>
<s>  said fagin </s>
<s>   if you was to like my friend
could you do better than join him </s>
<s> 

is he in a good way of business </s>
<s>  thats where it is </s>
<s>  responded noah
winking one of his little eyes </s>
<s> 

the top of the tree </s>
<s>  employs a power of hands </s>
<s>  has the very best
society in the profession </s>
<s> 

regular townmaders </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole </s>

not a countryman among em </s>
<s>  and i dont think hed take you even on
my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just
now replied fagin </s>
<s> 

should i have to hand over </s>
<s>  said noah slapping his breechespocket </s>
<s> 

it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most
decided manner </s>
<s> 

twenty pound thoughits a lot of money </s>
<s> 

not when its in a note you cant get rid of retorted fagin </s>
<s>  number
and date taken i suppose </s>
<s>   payment stopped at the bank </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>   its not
worth much to him </s>
<s>   itll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it
for a great deal in the market </s>

when could i see him </s>
<s>  asked noah doubtfully </s>
<s> 

tomorrow morning </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s> 

um </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   whats the wages </s>
<s> 

live like a gentlemanboard and lodging pipes and spirits freehalf
of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied <abvr>
fagin </s>
<s> 

whether noah claypole whose rapacity was none of the least
comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he

something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not

you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we

certainly replied <abvr> bolter </s>

well </s>

number two you mean said <abvr> bolter who was largely endowed with

no i dont </s>

mr </s>

inconveniently tight </s>
<s>  and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not
in substance </s>
<s> 

the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly
fingerpost which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway </s>
<s>   to keep in
the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with

of course it is replied <abvr> bolter </s>

only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his

thats true rejoined <abvr> bolter thoughtfully </s>

old codger </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no
mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a
sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should
entertain in the outset of their acquaintance </s>
<s>   to strengthen an
impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by
acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his
operations </s>
<s>  blending truth and fiction together as best served his
purpose </s>
<s>  and bringing both to bear with so much art that <abvr> bolters
respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with
a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken </s>
<s> 

its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
heavy losses said fagin </s>

morning </s>

you dont mean to say he died </s>

a pocket and they found a silver snuffbox on himhis own my dear

the dodger </s>

well but i shall know him i hope </s>

bolter </s>
<s> 

im doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh </s>
<s>   if they dont
get any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we
shall have him back again after six weeks or so </s>

a case of lagging </s>

what do you mean by lagging and a lifer </s>

the good of talking in that way to me </s>
<s>  why dont yer speak so as i can
understand yer </s>
<s> 

fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the
vulgar tongue </s>
<s>  and being interpreted <abvr> bolter would have been
informed that they represented that combination of words
transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry
of master bates with his hands in his breechespockets and his face
twisted into a look of semicomical woe </s>

its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had
been made known to each other </s>

what do you mean </s>

theyve found the gentleman as owns the box </s>

oh why didnt he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables and
go out as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour

<s> 

with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master
bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
despondency </s>

what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for </s>

exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil </s>

that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder </s>

never mind charley said fagin soothingly </s>

it fagin </s>

would </s>

<s> 

ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands </s>

i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his pupil </s>

so do i cried charley bates </s>

<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>

<s>   i see it all
afore me upon my soul i do fagin </s>

all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of
em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges own son making
a speech arter dinnerha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

in fact <abvr> fagin had so well humoured his young friends eccentric
disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to
consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now
looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and
exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time
when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of
displaying his abilities </s>
<s> 

we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other
said fagin </s>
<s>   let me think </s>
<s> 

shall i go </s>

not for the world replied fagin </s>

that youd walk into the very place whereno charley no </s>

enough to lose at a time </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to go yourself i suppose </s>
<s>  said charley with a
humorous leer </s>
<s> 

that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head </s>
<s> 

then why dont you send this new cove </s>
<s>  asked master bates laying his
hand on noahs arm </s>
<s>   nobody knows him </s>
<s> 

why if he didnt mind observed fagin </s>
<s> 

mind </s>
<s>  interposed charley </s>
<s>   what should he have to mind </s>
<s> 

really nothing my dear said fagin turning to <abvr> bolter really
nothing </s>
<s> 

oh i dare say about that yer know observed noah backing towards
the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm </s>
<s>   no
nonone of that </s>
<s>   its not in my department that aint </s>
<s> 

wot department has he got fagin </s>
<s>  inquired master bates surveying
noahs lank form with much disgust </s>
<s>   the cutting away when theres
anything wrong and the eating all the wittles when theres everything
right </s>
<s>  is that his branch </s>
<s> 

never mind retorted <abvr> bolter </s>
<s>  and dont yer take liberties with
yer superiors little boy or yerll find yerself in the wrong shop </s>
<s> 

master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it
was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to <abvr> bolter
that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the policeoffice </s>
<s> 
that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had
engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to
the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of
having resorted to it for shelter </s>
<s>  and that if he were properly
disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in
london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which
he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will </s>
<s> 

persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much
greater degree by his fear of fagin <abvr> bolter at length consented
with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition </s>
<s>  by fagins
directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoners
frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings </s>
<s>   all of which articles
the jew had at hand </s>
<s>   he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well
garnished with turnpike tickets </s>
<s>  and a carters whip </s>
<s>   thus equipped
he was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent
garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his
curiousity </s>
<s>  and as he was as awkward ungainly and rawboned a fellow
as need be <abvr> fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to
perfection </s>
<s> 

these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs
and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by
master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short
distance of bow street </s>
<s>  having described the precise situation of the
office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk
straight up the passage and when he got into the side and pull off
his hat as he went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on
alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting </s>
<s> 

noah claypole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually
followed the directions he had received whichmaster bates being
pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was
enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question
or meeting with any interruption by the way </s>
<s> 

he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who
were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room at the upper end of which
was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the
prisoners on the left hand against the wall a box for the witnesses in
the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right </s>
<s>  the awful
locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed
the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they
could the full majesty of justice </s>
<s> 

there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to
their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a
couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the
table </s>
<s>   a jailer stood reclining against the dockrail tapping his
nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue
tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence </s>
<s>  or
looked sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the
gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries halfsmothered in the
mothers shawl from some meagre infant </s>
<s>   the room smelt close and
unwholesome </s>
<s>  the walls were dirtdiscoloured </s>
<s>  and the ceiling
blackened </s>
<s>   there was an old smoky bust over the mantelshelf and a
dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present that seemed to go
on as it ought </s>
<s>  for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance
with both had left a taint on all the animate matter hardly less
unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that
frowned upon it </s>
<s> 

noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger </s>
<s>  but although there were
several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be
supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all
answering the description given him of <abvr> dawkins was to be seen </s>
<s>   he
waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women
being committed for trial went flaunting out </s>
<s>  and then was quickly
relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once
could be no other than the object of his visit </s>
<s> 

it was indeed <abvr> dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big
coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left hand in his pocket and his
hat in his right hand preceded the jailer with a rolling gait
altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested
in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful
sitivation for </s>
<s>

aint there to my time and then praps ther wont be an action for
damage against them as kep me away </s>
<s>   oh no certainly not </s>
<s> 

at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a
view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to
communicate the names of them two files as was on the bench </s>
<s>   which
so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as
master bates could have done if he had heard the request </s>
<s> 

silence there </s>
<s>  cried the jailer </s>

<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thats right added the dodger </s>
<s>   where are they </s>
<s>   i should like

<s> 

this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward
who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in
a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very
old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own
countenance </s>
<s>   for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon
as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon
his person a silver snuffbox with the owners name engraved upon the
lid </s>

guide and being then and there present swore that the snuffbox was
his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had

remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making
his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him </s>

collar </s>

business of it </s>

glee and selfapproval </s>

deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape </s>
<s> 
still there were times when even towards him she felt some
relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp
he had so long eluded and he should fall at lastrichly as he merited
such a fateby her hand </s>
<s> 

but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix
itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by
any consideration </s>
<s>   her fears for sikes would have been more powerful
inducements to recoil while there was yet time </s>

that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which
could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a
refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses herand
what more could she do </s>
<s>  she was resolved </s>
<s> 

though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they
forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too </s>
<s> 
she grew pale and thin even within a few days </s>
<s>   at times she took no
heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where
once she would have been the loudest </s>
<s>   at other times she laughed
without merriment and was noisy without a moment afterwardsshe sat
silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the
very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even
these indications that she was ill at ease and that her thoughts were
occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the
course of discussion by her companions </s>
<s> 

it was sunday night and the bell of the nearest church struck the
hour </s>
<s>   sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen </s>
<s>   the
girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched and listened
too </s>
<s>   eleven </s>
<s> 

an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look
out and returning to his seat </s>
<s>   dark and heavy it is too </s>
<s>  a good night
for business this </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  replied fagin </s>
<s>   what a pity bill my dear that theres none
quite ready to be done </s>
<s> 

youre right for once replied sikes gruffly </s>
<s>   it is a pity for im
in the humour too </s>
<s> 

fagin sighed and shook his head despondingly </s>
<s> 

we must make up for lost time when weve got things into a good train </s>
<s> 
thats all i know said sikes </s>
<s> 

thats the way to talk my dear replied fagin venturing to pat him
on the shoulder </s>
<s>   it does me good to hear you </s>

does you good does it </s>
<s>  cried sikes </s>
<s>   well so be it </s>
<s> 

ha </s>

<s>  laughed fagin as if he were relieved by even this
concession </s>
<s>   youre like yourself tonight bill </s>
<s>   quite like
yourself </s>
<s> 

i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jews hand </s>

it make you nervous billreminds you of being nabbed does it </s>
<s> 
said fagin determined not to be offended </s>

reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes </s>
<s>  there never
was another man with such a face as yours unless it was your father

<s> 

fagin offered no reply to this compliment </s>
<s>   but pulling sikes by the
sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of
the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving
the room </s>

hallo </s>

what answers that </s>
<s>  retorted sikes </s>
<s>   do you hear me </s>
<s> 

i dont know where replied the girl </s>

then i do said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because
he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed </s>

nowhere </s>

im not well </s>

theres not enough there said the girl </s>

then you wont have it replied sikes </s>
<s>   with which assurance he rose
locked the door took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her
head flung it up to the top of an old press </s>
<s>   there said the
robber </s>
<s>   now stop quietly where you are will you </s>

its not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me said the girl
turning very pale </s>

youll drive me on the something desperate muttered the girl placing
both hands upon her breast as though to keep down by force some
violent outbreak </s>

<s>  cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground </s>
<s>

<s>  repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her </s>
<s> 
aye </s>
<s>   and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have
such a grip on your throat asll tear some of that screaming voice out </s>
<s> 
wot has come over you you jade </s>

down on the floor before the door she said bill let me go </s>

not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever </s>
<s> 
screamed the girl </s>
<s>   sikes looked on for a minute watching his
opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling
and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where
he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her
down by force </s>
<s>   she struggled and implored by turns until twelve
oclock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest
the point any further </s>
<s>   with a caution backed by many oaths to make
no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at
leisure and rejoined fagin </s>
<s> 

whew </s>
<s>  said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face </s>
<s> 
wot a precious strange gal that is </s>
<s> 

you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully </s>
<s>   you may say
that </s>
<s> 

wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you
think </s>
<s>  asked sikes </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>  you should know her better than me </s>
<s>  wot
does it mean </s>
<s> 

obstinacy </s>
<s>  womans obstinacy i suppose my dear </s>
<s> 

well i suppose it is growled sikes </s>
<s>   i thought i had tamed her
but shes as bad as ever </s>
<s> 

worse said fagin thoughtfully </s>
<s>   i never knew her like this for
such a little cause </s>
<s> 

nor i said sikes </s>
<s>   i think shes got a touch of that fever in her
blood yet and it wont come outeh </s>
<s> 

like enough </s>
<s> 

ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes
took that way again said sikes </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment </s>
<s> 

she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched
on my back </s>
<s>  and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself
aloof said sikes </s>
<s>   we was poor too all the time and i think one
way or other its worried and fretted her </s>
<s>  and that being shut up here
so long has made her restlesseh </s>
<s> 

thats it my dear replied the jew in a whisper </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 

as he uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her
former seat </s>
<s>   her eyes were swollen and red </s>
<s>  she rocked herself to and
fro </s>
<s>  tossed her head </s>
<s>  and after a little time burst out laughing </s>
<s> 

why now shes on the other tack </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes turning a look of
excessive surprise on his companion </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then </s>
<s>  and in a few
minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour </s>
<s>  whispering
sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat
and bade him goodnight </s>
<s>   he paused when he reached the roomdoor and
looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs </s>
<s> 

light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe </s>
<s>  its a pity he
should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers </s>
<s>   show
him a light </s>
<s> 

nancy followed the old man downstairs with a candle </s>
<s>   when they
reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close
to the girl said in a whisper </s>
<s> 

what is it nancy dear </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  replied the girl in the same tone </s>
<s> 

the reason of all this replied fagin </s>
<s>   if hehe pointed with
his skinny forefinger up the stairsis so hard with you hes a
brute nance a brutebeast why dont you

well </s>
<s>  said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching
her ear and his eyes looking into hers </s>
<s> 

no matter just now </s>
<s>   well talk of this again </s>
<s>   you have a friend in
me nance </s>
<s>  a staunch friend </s>
<s>   i have the means at hand quiet and
close </s>
<s>   if you want revenge on those that treat you like a doglike a
dog </s>
<s>   worse than his dog for he humours him sometimescome to me </s>
<s>   i
say come to me </s>
<s>   he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of
old nance </s>
<s> 

i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least
emotion </s>
<s>   goodnight </s>
<s> 

she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said
goodnight again in a steady voice and answering his parting look
with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them </s>
<s> 

fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were
working within his brain </s>
<s>   he had conceived the ideanot from what had
just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by
degreesthat nancy wearied of the housebreakers brutality had
conceived an attachment for some new friend </s>
<s>   her altered manner her
repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the
interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and
added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him
at least almost matter of certainty </s>
<s>   the object of this new liking
was not among his myrmidons </s>
<s>   he would be a valuable acquisition with
such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured
without delay </s>
<s> 

there was another and a darker object to be gained </s>
<s>   sikes knew too
much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the
wounds were hidden </s>
<s>   the girl must know well that if she shook him
off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely
wreakedto the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of lifeon the
object of her more recent fancy </s>
<s> 

with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that
she would consent to poison him </s>
<s>   women have done such things and
worse to secure the same object before now </s>
<s>   there would be the
dangerous villain </s>
<s>   the man i hate </s>
<s>   gone </s>
<s>  another secured in his
place </s>
<s>  and my influence over the girl with a knowledge of this crime
to back it unlimited </s>
<s> 

these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he
sat alone in the housebreakers room </s>
<s>  and with them uppermost in his
thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of
sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting </s>
<s>   there
was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to
understand his meaning </s>
<s>   the girl clearly comprehended it </s>
<s>   her glance
at parting showed that </s>
<s> 

but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and
that was one of the chief ends to be attained </s>
<s>  how thought fagin as
he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her </s>
<s>   what new
power can i acquire </s>
<s> 

such brains are fertile in expedients </s>
<s>   if without extracting a
confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her
altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of
whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs
could he not secure her compliance </s>
<s> 

i can said fagin almost aloud </s>
<s>   she durst not refuse me then </s>
<s>   not
for her life not for her life </s>
<s>   i have it all </s>
<s>   the means are ready
and shall be set to work </s>
<s>   i shall have you yet </s>
<s> 

he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards
the spot where he had left the bolder villain </s>
<s>  and went on his way </s>
<s> 
busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he
wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy
crushed with every motion of his fingers </s>

noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission

that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and
equipped in his carters dress </s>

fagin </s>
<s>   six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin
came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was

exultation he could not conceal </s>

she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im
sure </s>

not be back much before daybreak </s>
<s>   come with me </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s> 

noah started up without saying a word </s>
<s>  for the jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him </s>
<s>   they left the house
stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at
length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in
which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london </s>

it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed </s>

on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle </s>

and the door was closed behind them </s>
<s> 

scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words
fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of
glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in
the adjoining room </s>

is that the woman </s>

fagin nodded yes </s>

i cant see her face well whispered noah </s>

plainly </s>

he did so </s>

considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the
better to observe her motions </s>

thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
her pass on </s>

walk with a steadier and firmer step </s>

chapter xlvi

the appointment kept

the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures
emerged on london bridge </s>
<s>   one which advanced with a swift and rapid
step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in
quest of some expected object </s>
<s>  the other figure was that of a man who
slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance
accommodated his pace to hers </s>
<s>   stopping when she stopped </s>
<s>   and as she
moved again creeping stealthily on </s>
<s>   but never allowing himself in
the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps </s>
<s>   thus they
crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the
woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the
footpassengers turned back </s>
<s>   the movement was sudden </s>
<s>  but he who
watched her was not thrown off his guard by it </s>
<s>  for shrinking into
one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning
over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to
pass on the opposite pavement </s>
<s>  when she was about the same distance in
advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed
her again </s>
<s>  at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped </s>
<s>   the man
stopped too </s>
<s> 

it was a very dark night </s>
<s>   the day had been unfavourable and at that
hour and place there were few people stirring </s>
<s>  such as there were
hurried quickly past </s>
<s>   very possibly without seeing but certainly
without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view </s>
<s> 
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way
over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless
hovel wherein to lay their heads </s>
<s>  they stood there in silence </s>
<s>   neither
speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed </s>
<s> 

a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks </s>
<s> 
the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull
from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water
too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes </s>
<s>  the tower of old
saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the
giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom </s>
<s>  but the
forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of
churches above were nearly all hidden from sight </s>
<s> 

the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched
meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st </s>
<s>  pauls
tolled for the death of another day </s>
<s>   midnight had come upon the
crowded city </s>
<s>   the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse </s>
<s> 
the chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face
of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child </s>
<s>   midnight was upon them
all </s>
<s> 

the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by
a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a
short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked
straight towards it </s>
<s>   they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement
when the girl started and immediately made towards them </s>
<s> 

they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who
entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate </s>
<s> 
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it
immediately </s>
<s>  for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment </s>
<s> 

not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here </s>
<s> 
come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder </s>
<s> 

as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction
in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on </s>
<s> 

the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the
surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours
church form a landingstairs from the river </s>
<s>   to this spot the man
bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved </s>
<s>  and after
a moments survey of the place he began to descend </s>
<s> 

these stairs are a part of the bridge </s>
<s>  they consist of three flights </s>
<s> 
just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the
left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames </s>
<s> 
at this point the lower steps widen </s>
<s>   so that a person turning that
angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs
who chance to be above him if only a step </s>
<s>  the countryman looked
hastily round when he reached this point </s>
<s>  and as there seemed no
better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty
of room he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there
waited </s>
<s>   pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if
he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with
safety </s>
<s> 

so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he
had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for
lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or
had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
conversation </s>
<s>   he was on the point of emerging from his hidingplace
and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and
directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear </s>
<s> 

he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely
breathing listened attentively </s>
<s> 

this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the
gentleman </s>
<s>   i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther </s>
<s>   many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but
you see i am willing to humour you </s>
<s> 

to humour me </s>
<s>  cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed </s>
<s> 
youre considerate indeed sir </s>
<s>   to humour me </s>
<s>   well well its no
matter </s>
<s> 

why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose
can you have brought us to this strange place </s>
<s>   why not have let me
speak to you above there where it is light and there is something
stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole </s>
<s> 

i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you
there </s>
<s>   i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have
such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand </s>
<s> 

a fear of what </s>
<s>  asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her </s>
<s> 

i scarcely know of what replied the girl </s>
<s>   i wish i did </s>
<s>  horrible
thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that
has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day </s>
<s>   i was
reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things
came into the print </s>
<s> 

imagination said the gentleman soothing her </s>
<s> 

no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice </s>
<s>  ill swear i saw
coffin written in every page of the book in large black
lettersaye and they carried one close to me in the streets
tonight </s>
<s> 

there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman </s>
<s>  they have
passed me often </s>
<s> 

real ones rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   this was not </s>
<s> 

there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the
concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and
the blood chilled within him </s>
<s>   he had never experienced a greater
relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged
her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such
fearful fancies </s>
<s> 

speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion </s>
<s>  poor
creature </s>
<s>   she seems to need it </s>
<s> 

your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the
girl </s>
<s>   oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks
as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth
and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud
instead of so much humbler </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the gentleman </s>
<s>   a turk turns his face after washing it
well to the east when he says his prayers </s>
<s>  these good people after
giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles
off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven </s>
<s> 
between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first </s>
<s> 

these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were
perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover
herself </s>
<s>   the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her </s>
<s> 

you were not here last sunday night he said </s>
<s> 

i couldnt come replied nancy </s>
<s>  i was kept by force </s>
<s> 

by whom </s>
<s> 

him that i told the young lady of before </s>
<s> 

you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope </s>
<s>  asked the old
gentleman </s>
<s> 

no replied the girl shaking her head </s>
<s>   its not very easy for me
to leave him unless he knows why </s>
<s>  i couldnt give him a drink of
laudanum before i came away </s>
<s> 

did he awake before you returned </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  and neither he nor any of them suspect me </s>
<s> 

good said the gentleman </s>
<s>   now listen to me </s>
<s> 

i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment </s>
<s> 

this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to
some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly
a fortnight since </s>
<s>   i confess to you that i had doubts at first
whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe
you are </s>
<s> 

i am said the girl earnestly </s>
<s> 

i repeat that i firmly believe it </s>
<s>   to prove to you that i am disposed
to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the
secret whatever it may be from the fear of this man monks </s>
<s>   but
ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured
cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew </s>
<s> 

fagin cried the girl recoiling </s>
<s> 

that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman </s>
<s> 

i will not do it </s>
<s>   i will never do it </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>  devil that
he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that </s>
<s> 

you will not </s>
<s>  said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this
answer </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  returned the girl </s>
<s> 

tell me why </s>
<s> 

for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the
lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her
promise </s>
<s>   and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has
led i have led a bad life too </s>
<s>  there are many of us who have kept the
same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of
themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are </s>
<s> 

then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he
had been aiming to attain </s>
<s>  put monks into my hands and leave him to
me to deal with </s>
<s> 

what if he turns against the others </s>
<s> 

i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him
there the matter will rest </s>
<s>  there must be circumstances in olivers
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye
and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free </s>
<s> 

and if it is not </s>
<s>  suggested the girl </s>
<s> 

then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to
justice without your consent </s>
<s>   in such a case i could show you reasons
i think which would induce you to yield it </s>
<s> 

have i the ladys promise for that </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

you have replied rose </s>
<s>   my true and faithful pledge </s>
<s> 

monks would never learn how you knew what you do </s>
<s>  said the girl
after a short pause </s>
<s> 

never replied the gentleman </s>
<s>   the intelligence should be brought to
bear upon him that he could never even guess </s>
<s> 

i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the
girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words </s>
<s> 

after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so
she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by
name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that
night </s>
<s>   from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared
as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
communicated </s>
<s>   when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the
place the best position from which to watch it without exciting
observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the
habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for
the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to
her recollection </s>
<s> 

he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout </s>
<s> 
he has a lurking walk </s>
<s>  and as he walks constantly looks over his
shoulder first on one side and then on the other </s>
<s>  dont forget that
for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans
that you might almost tell him by that alone </s>
<s>   his face is dark like
his hair and eyes </s>
<s>  and although he cant be more than six or eight and
twenty withered and haggard </s>
<s>  his lips are often discoloured and
disfigured with the marks of teeth </s>
<s>  for he has desperate fits and
sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you
start </s>
<s>  said the girl stopping suddenly </s>
<s> 

the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious
of having done so and begged her to proceed </s>
<s> 

part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at
the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times
he was covered up in a large cloak </s>
<s>   i think thats all i can give you
to know him by </s>
<s>   stay though she added </s>
<s>   upon his throat </s>
<s>   so high
that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his
face </s>
<s>   there is

a broad red mark like a burn or scald </s>
<s>  cried the gentleman </s>
<s> 

hows this </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   you know him </s>
<s> 

the young lady uttered a cry of surprise and for a few moments they
were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe </s>
<s> 

i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence </s>
<s>   i should by
your description </s>
<s>   we shall see </s>
<s>   many people are singularly like each
other </s>
<s>   it may not be the same </s>
<s> 

as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he
took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell
from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he </s>
<s> 

now he said returning </s>
<s>   so it seemed by the sound </s>
<s>   to the spot
where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance
young woman and i wish you to be the better for it </s>
<s>  what can i do to
serve you </s>
<s> 

nothing replied nancy </s>
<s> 

you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a
voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder
and more obdurate heart </s>
<s>  think now </s>
<s>   tell me </s>
<s> 

nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping </s>
<s>   you can do nothing to
help me </s>
<s>   i am past all hope indeed </s>
<s> 

you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman </s>
<s>  the past has
been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such
priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never
grants again but for the future you may hope </s>
<s>  i do not say that it
is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must
come as you seek it </s>
<s>  but a quiet asylum either in england or if you
fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the
compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you </s>
<s>  before
the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of
daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your
former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind
you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   i
would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion
or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is
pestilence and death to you </s>
<s>   quit them all while there is time and
opportunity </s>
<s> 

she will be persuaded now cried the young lady </s>
<s>   she hesitates i
am sure </s>
<s> 

i fear not my dear said the gentleman </s>
<s> 

no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle </s>
<s>   i am
chained to my old life </s>
<s>   i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave
it </s>
<s>   i must have gone too far to turn backand yet i dont know for
if you had spoken to me so some time ago i should have laughed it
off </s>
<s>   but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me
again </s>
<s>   i must go home </s>
<s> 

home </s>
<s>  repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word </s>
<s> 

home lady rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   to such a home as i have raised for
myself with the work of my whole life </s>
<s>   let us part </s>
<s>  i shall be watched

<s>   go </s>
<s>   if i have done you any service all i ask is that
you leave me and let me go my way alone </s>
<s> 

it is useless said the gentleman with a sigh </s>
<s>   we compromise her
safety perhaps by staying here </s>
<s>   we may have detained her longer than
she expected already </s>
<s> 

yes yes urged the girl </s>
<s>  you have </s>
<s> 

what cried the young lady can be the end of this poor creatures
life </s>

what </s>
<s>  repeated the girl </s>

water </s>
<s>   how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the
tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them </s>
<s>   it may
be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at
last </s>
<s> 

do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing </s>
<s> 

it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors
should </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   goodnight goodnight </s>
<s> 

the gentleman turned away </s>
<s> 

this purse cried the young lady </s>
<s>   take it for my sake that you may
have some resource in an hour of need and trouble </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   i have not done this for money </s>
<s>   let me have

handkerchiefanything that i can keep as having belonged to you
sweet lady </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>   bless you </s>
<s>   god bless you </s>
<s>  goodnight goodnight </s>
<s> 

the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some
discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to
determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested </s>
<s> 

the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased </s>
<s> 

the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
appeared upon the bridge </s>
<s>   they stopped at the summit of the stairs </s>
<s> 

hark </s>
<s>  cried the young lady listening </s>
<s>   did she call </s>
<s>   i thought i
heard her voice </s>
<s> 

no my love replied <abvr> brownlow looking sadly back </s>
<s>  she has not
moved and will not till we are gone </s>
<s> 

rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his
and led her with gentle force away </s>
<s>   as they disappeared the girl
sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and
vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears </s>
<s> 

after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street </s>
<s>   the astonished listener remained motionless on his post
for some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious
glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his
hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in
the same manner as he had descended </s>
<s> 

peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that
he was unobserved noah claypole darted away at his utmost speed and
made for the jews house as fast as his legs would carry him </s>

chapter xlvii

fatal consequences

it was nearly two hours before daybreak </s>
<s>  that time which in the autumn
of the year may be truly called the dead of night </s>
<s>  when the streets
are silent and deserted </s>
<s>  when even sounds appear to slumber and
profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream </s>
<s>  it was at this still
and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so
distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less
like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and
worried by an evil spirit </s>
<s> 

he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet
with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his side </s>
<s>   his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed
in thought he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his
toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats </s>
<s> 

stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep </s>
<s> 
towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and
then brought them back again to the candle </s>
<s>  which with a longburnt
wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon
the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere </s>
<s> 

indeed they were </s>
<s>   mortification at the overthrow of his notable
scheme </s>
<s>  hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers </s>
<s>  and
utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up </s>
<s>  bitter
disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes </s>
<s>  the fear of
detection and ruin and death </s>
<s>  and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all </s>
<s>  these were the passionate considerations which following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain
of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his
heart </s>
<s> 

he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take
the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted
by a footstep in the street </s>
<s> 

at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth </s>
<s>  at last </s>
<s> 

the bell rang gently as he spoke </s>
<s>   he crept upstairs to the door and
presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who
carried a bundle under one arm </s>
<s>  sitting down and throwing back his
outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  he said laying the bundle on the table </s>
<s>   take care of that
and do the most you can with it </s>
<s>   its been trouble enough to get </s>
<s>  i
thought i should have been here three hours ago </s>
<s> 

fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard
sat down again without speaking </s>
<s>   but he did not take his eyes off the
robber for an instant during this action </s>
<s>  and now that they sat over
against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his
lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions
which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back
his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright </s>
<s> 

wot now </s>
<s>  cried sikes </s>
<s>   wot do you look at a man so for </s>
<s> 

fagin raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the
air </s>
<s>  but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the
moment gone </s>
<s> 

damme </s>
<s>  said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm </s>
<s>  hes
gone mad </s>
<s>   i must look to myself here </s>
<s> 

no no rejoined fagin finding his voice </s>
<s>   its notyoure not the
person bill </s>
<s>   ive nono fault to find with you </s>
<s> 

oh you havent havent you </s>
<s>  said sikes looking sternly at him and
ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket </s>
<s>   thats
luckyfor one of us </s>
<s>   which one that is dont matter </s>
<s> 

ive got that to tell you bill said fagin drawing his chair
nearer will make you worse than me </s>

<s>  returned the robber with an incredulous air </s>
<s>   tell away </s>
<s>  look
sharp or nance will think im lost </s>
<s> 

lost </s>
<s>  cried fagin </s>
<s>   she has pretty well settled that in her own
mind already </s>
<s> 

sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face
and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched
his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly </s>
<s> 

speak will you </s>
<s>  he said </s>
<s>  or if you dont it shall be for want of
breath </s>
<s>   open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words </s>
<s> 
out with it you thundering old cur out with it </s>
<s>

sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not
previously observed him </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  he said resuming his former position </s>
<s> 

suppose that lad pursued fagin was to peachto blow upon us
allfirst seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having
a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe
every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be
most easily taken </s>

peaching to them </s>

<s>  cried the jew his eyes flashing
with rage </s>
<s>   suppose he did all this what then </s>
<s> 

what then </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s>  with a tremendous oath </s>
<s>   if he was left
alive till i came id grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot
into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head </s>
<s> 

what if i did it </s>
<s>  cried fagin almost in a yell </s>
<s>   i that knows so
much and could hang so many besides myself </s>
<s> 

i dont know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at
the mere suggestion </s>
<s>   id do something in the jail that ud get me put
in irons </s>
<s>  and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with
them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people </s>

arm that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over
it </s>

<s> 

fagin looked hard at the robber </s>
<s>  and motioning him to be silent
stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse
him </s>
<s>   sikes leant forward in his chair </s>
<s>   looking on with his hands upon
his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and
preparation was to end in </s>

bolter bolter </s>

of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis </s>

<s>  asked sikes drawing back </s>

fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him
into a sitting posture </s>

several times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked
sleepily about him </s>

tell me that againonce again just for him to hear said the jew
pointing to sikes as he spoke </s>

to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough </s>

didand to describe him which she didand to tell her what house it

best watched from which she didand what time the people went there
which she did </s>

<s> 

flinging the old man from him he rushed from the room and darted
wildly and furiously up the stairs </s>
<s> 

bill bill </s>
<s>  cried fagin following him hastily </s>
<s>   a word </s>
<s>  only a
word </s>
<s> 

the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was
unable to open the door </s>

violence when the jew came panting up </s>

<s> 

the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see
each others faces </s>
<s>   they exchanged one brief glance </s>
<s>  there was a fire
in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken </s>
<s> 

i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now
useless not too violent for safety </s>
<s>   be crafty bill and not too
bold </s>
<s> 

sikes made no reply </s>
<s>  but pulling open the door of which fagin had
turned the lock dashed into the silent streets </s>
<s> 

without one pause or moments consideration </s>
<s>  without once turning his
head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering
them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage
resolution </s>
<s>   his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw
seemed starting through his skin </s>
<s>  the robber held on his headlong
course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his
own door </s>
<s>   he opened it softly with a key </s>
<s>  strode lightly up the
stairs </s>
<s>  and entering his own room doublelocked the door and lifting
a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed </s>
<s> 

the girl was lying halfdressed upon it </s>
<s>   he had roused her from her
sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look </s>

<s>  said the girl with an expression of pleasure at his
return </s>
<s> 

it is was the reply </s>
<s>   get up </s>
<s> 

there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the
candlestick and hurled it under the grate </s>
<s>   seeing the faint light of
early day without the girl rose to undraw the curtain </s>
<s> 

let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her </s>
<s>  theres enough
light for wot ive got to do </s>
<s> 

bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like
that at me </s>
<s> 

the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils
and heaving breast </s>
<s>  and then grasping her by the head and throat
dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the
door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth </s>

it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the

hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little
street crept into a small publichouse whose scanty light had guided
them to the spot </s>

from hatfield to st </s>

he went on doggedly </s>

into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt a dread and awe
creeping upon him which shook him to the core </s>
<s>  every object before him
substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some
fearful thing </s>
<s>  but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that
haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following at his heels </s>
<s> 
he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the
outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along </s>
<s>   he
could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of
wind came laden with that last low cry </s>
<s>   if he stopped it did the same </s>
<s> 
if he ran it followednot running too </s>
<s>   that would have been a
relief </s>
<s>   but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life and
borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell </s>

at times he turned with desperate determination resolved to beat
this phantom off though it should look him dead </s>
<s>  but the hair rose on
his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was
behind him then </s>
<s>   he had kept it before him that morning but it was
behind nowalways </s>
<s>   he leaned his back against a bank and felt that
it stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky </s>
<s>   he threw
himself upon the roadon his back upon the road </s>
<s>   at his head it
stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph
in blood </s>
<s> 

let no man talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence
must sleep </s>
<s>   there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long
minute of that agony of fear </s>

there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the
night </s>
<s>   before the door were three tall poplar trees which made it
very dark within </s>
<s>  and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail </s>
<s> 
he could not walk on till daylight came again </s>

himself close to the wallto undergo new torture </s>
<s> 

for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than

<s>   those widely staring eyes so
lustreless and so glassy that he had better borne to see them than

themselves but giving light to nothing </s>

were everywhere </s>

figure was behind him </s>

more </s>
<s>   the eyes were there before he had laid himself along </s>
<s> 

and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling
in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when
suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting
and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder </s>
<s>   any sound of men
in that lonely place even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm

prospect of personal danger </s>
<s>  and springing to his feet rushed into the
open air </s>

the broad sky seemed on fire </s>
<s>   rising into the air with showers of
sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting
the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the
direction where he stood </s>

of an alarmbell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames
as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though
refreshed by food </s>

people theremen and womenlight bustle </s>
<s>   it was like new life to
him </s>
<s>   he darted onwardstraight headlongdashing through brier and
brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog who careered
with loud and sounding bark before him </s>
<s> 

he came upon the spot </s>
<s>   there were halfdressed figures tearing to and
fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables

coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks
and the tumbling down of redhot beams </s>
<s>   the apertures where doors and
windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire </s>
<s>  walls
rocked and crumbled into the burning well </s>
<s>  the molten lead and iron
poured down white hot upon the ground </s>
<s>   women and children shrieked
and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers </s>
<s>   the
clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water
as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar </s>
<s>   he
shouted too till he was hoarse </s>
<s>  and flying from memory and himself
plunged into the thickest of the throng </s>
<s>   hither and thither he dived
that night </s>
<s>   now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the
smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
men were thickest </s>
<s>   up and down the ladders upon the roofs of
buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under
the lee of falling bricks and stones in every part of that great fire
was he </s>
<s>  but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise
nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke
and blackened ruins remained </s>
<s> 

this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the
dreadful consciousness of his crime </s>
<s>   he looked suspiciously about him
for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject
of their talk </s>
<s>   the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and
they drew off stealthily together </s>
<s>   he passed near an engine where
some men were seated and they called to him to share in their
refreshment </s>
<s>   he took some bread and meat </s>
<s>  and as he drank a draught of
beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the
murder </s>
<s>   he has gone to birmingham they say said one </s>
<s>   but theyll
have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell
be a cry all through the country </s>
<s> 

he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground </s>
<s>  then
lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep </s>
<s>   he
wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the
fear of another solitary night </s>

suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london </s>

<s> 

he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least

a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
fixed on for his destination </s>

resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond </s>

were making </s>

brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright </s>

to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and
started back </s>

chapter l

the pursuit and escape

near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe
abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on
the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
closebuilt lowroofed houses there exists the filthiest the
strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are
hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of
its inhabitants </s>
<s> 

to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of
close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest
of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to
occasion </s>
<s>   the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
shops </s>
<s>  the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
the salesmans door and stream from the houseparapet and windows </s>
<s> 
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class
ballastheavers coalwhippers brazen women ragged children and the
raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along
assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which
branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of
ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
of warehouses that rise from every corner </s>
<s>   arriving at length in
streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has
passed he walks beneath tottering housefronts projecting over the
pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes chimneys
half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron
bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign
of desolation and neglect </s>
<s> 

in such a neighborhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark
stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet
deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill
pond but known in the days of this story as folly ditch </s>
<s>   it is a
creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water
by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old
name </s>
<s>   at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden
bridges thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the
houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows
buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the
water up </s>
<s>  and when his eye is turned from these operations to the
houses themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene
before him </s>
<s>   crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen
houses with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath </s>
<s>  windows
broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen
that is never there </s>
<s>  rooms so small so filthy so confined that the
air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they
shelter </s>
<s>  wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and
threatening to fall into itas some have done </s>
<s>  dirtbesmeared walls
and decaying foundations </s>
<s>  every repulsive lineament of poverty every
loathsome indication of filth rot and garbage </s>
<s>  all these ornament the
banks of folly ditch </s>
<s> 

in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty </s>
<s>  the walls are
crumbling down </s>
<s>  the windows are windows no more </s>
<s>  the doors are falling
into the streets </s>
<s>  the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke </s>
<s> 
thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon
it it was a thriving place </s>
<s>  but now it is a desolate island indeed </s>
<s> 
the houses have no owners </s>
<s>  they are broken open and entered upon by
those who have the courage </s>
<s>  and there they live and there they die </s>
<s> 
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced
to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island </s>
<s> 

in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size
ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window </s>
<s> 
of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
describedthere were assembled three men who regarding each other
every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation
sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence </s>
<s>   one of these was
toby crackit another <abvr> chitling and the third a robber of fifty
years whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and
whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the
same occasion </s>
<s>   this man was a returned transport and his name was
kags </s>
<s> 

i wish said toby turning to <abvr> chitling that you had picked out
some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come
here my fine feller </s>

why didnt you blunderhead </s>

<s> 

well i thought youd have been a little more glad to see me than
this replied <abvr> chitling with a melancholy air </s>
<s> 

why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so
very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over
his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it its rather a
startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with
at conweniency circumstanced as you are </s>
<s> 

especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping
with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts
and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return
added <abvr> kags </s>
<s> 

there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon
as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devilmaycare
swagger turned to chitling and said

is </s>

he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here

you should have heard the people groan said chitling </s>
<s>  the officers
fought like devils or theyd have torn him away </s>
<s>   he was down once
but they made a ring round him and fought their way along </s>
<s>   you should
have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to
them as if they were his dearest friends </s>

snarling with their teeth and making at him </s>

his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked
themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore
theyd tear his heart out </s>
<s> 

the horrorstricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his
ears and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro
like one distracted </s>

while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their
eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs
and sikess dog bounded into the room </s>

downstairs and into the street </s>

window </s>

whats the meaning of this </s>

if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he
did it </s>

behind </s>
<s>   he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so
easy </s>

this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the
right </s>

without more notice from anybody </s>

it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and
placed upon the table </s>

made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and
uncertainty of their own position </s>

together starting at every sound </s>
<s>   they spoke little and that in
whispers and were as silent and awestricken as if the remains of the
murdered woman lay in the next room </s>

they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below </s>

young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he
felt himself </s>

the knocking came again </s>

crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head </s>

there was no need to tell them who it was </s>

chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he had finished </s>

over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it

there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the

pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent
gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the
strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of

were nearest to set the house on fire </s>
<s>  others roared to the officers to
shoot him dead </s>
<s>   among them all none showed such fury as the man on
horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting
through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the
window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the
man who brings a ladder </s>
<s> 

the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it </s>
<s>   some
called for ladders some for sledgehammers </s>
<s>  some ran with torches to

spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations </s>

forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of
those below </s>

waterspout and crevices in the wall </s>
<s>  and all waved to and fro in the
darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind </s>
<s>   and
joined from time to time in one loud furious roar </s>

long rope </s>

clear off that way </s>
<s>   give me a rope or i shall do three more murders
and kill myself </s>
<s> 

the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept </s>
<s>  the
murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up
to the housetop </s>
<s> 

all the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up
except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that
was too small even for the passage of his body </s>
<s>   but from this
aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the
back </s>
<s>  and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by
the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in
an unbroken stream </s>
<s> 

he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose
so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
to open it from the inside </s>
<s>  and creeping over the tiles looked over
the low parapet </s>
<s> 

the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud </s>
<s> 

the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his
motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it
and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
which all their previous shouting had been whispers </s>
<s>   again and again
it rose </s>
<s>   those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning
took up the sound </s>
<s>  it echoed and reechoed </s>
<s>  it seemed as though the
whole city had poured its population out to curse him </s>
<s> 

on pressed the people from the fronton on on in a strong
struggling current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch
to lighten them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion </s>
<s> 
the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the
mob </s>
<s>  sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out </s>
<s>  there were tiers and
tiers of faces in every window </s>
<s>  cluster upon cluster of people clinging
to every housetop </s>
<s>   each little bridge and there were three in sight
bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it </s>
<s>   still the current poured
on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only
for an instant see the wretch </s>
<s> 

they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge </s>
<s>  hurrah </s>
<s> 

the crowd grew light with uncovered heads </s>
<s>  and again the shout uprose </s>
<s> 

i will give fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter to the man who takes him alive </s>
<s>   i will remain here till he
come to ask me for it </s>
<s> 

there was another roar </s>
<s>   at this moment the word was passed among the
crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first
called for the ladder had mounted into the room </s>
<s>   the stream abruptly
turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth </s>
<s>  and the people at
the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their
stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now
thronged pellmell to the spot they had left </s>
<s>   each man crushing and
striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near
the door and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out </s>
<s> 
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation
or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion were
dreadful </s>
<s>  the narrow ways were completely blocked up </s>
<s>  and at this time
between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and
the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the
mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer
although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible
increased </s>
<s> 

the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
crowd and the impossibility of escape </s>
<s>  but seeing this sudden change
with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his feet
determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the
ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in
the darkness and confusion </s>
<s> 

roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within
the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he
set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the
rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong
running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second </s>
<s>   he
could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the
ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut
it then and drop </s>
<s> 

at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to
slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman
beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly
warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat
that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw
his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror </s>
<s> 

the eyes again </s>
<s>  he cried in an unearthly screech </s>
<s> 

staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled
over the parapet </s>
<s>   the noose was on his neck </s>
<s>  it ran up with his
weight tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speeds </s>
<s>   he
fell for fiveandthirty feet </s>
<s>   there was a sudden jerk a terrific
convulsion of the limbs </s>
<s>  and there he hung with the open knife
clenched in his stiffening hand </s>
<s> 

the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely </s>
<s>  the
murderer swung lifeless against the wall </s>
<s>  and the boy thrusting aside
the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come
and take him out for gods sake </s>
<s> 

a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on
the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring
jumped for the dead mans shoulders </s>
<s>  missing his aim he fell into the
ditch turning completely over as he went </s>

against a stone dashed out his brains </s>

chapter li

affording an explanation of more mysteries than one and comprehending
a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney

the events narrated in the last </s>
<s> were yet but two days old when
oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a
travellingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie
and rose and <abvr> bedwin and the good doctor were with him </s>
<s>   and <abvr>
brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned </s>
<s> 

they had not talked much upon the way </s>
<s>  for oliver was in a flutter of
agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less
effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree </s>
<s> 
he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by <abvr>
brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
monks </s>
<s>  and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense </s>
<s> 

the same kind friend had with <abvr> losbernes assistance cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place </s>
<s> 
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long
but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be
at a worse </s>
<s>   so they travelled on in silence </s>
<s>   each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together </s>
<s>   and no one
disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all </s>
<s> 

but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they
journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the
whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a
crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into
that which he had traversed on foot </s>
<s>   a poor houseless wandering boy
without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head </s>
<s> 

see there there </s>
<s>  cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose
and pointing out at the carriage window </s>
<s>  thats the stile i came over </s>
<s> 
there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake
me and force me back </s>
<s>   yonder is the path across the fields leading to
the old house where i was a little child </s>
<s>   oh dick dick my dear old
friend if i could only see you now </s>
<s> 

you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands
between her own </s>
<s>   you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich
you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great
as the coming back to make him happy too </s>
<s> 

yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and
have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place
where he may grow strong and wellshall we </s>
<s> 

rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak </s>
<s> 

you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said
oliver </s>
<s>   it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell </s>
<s>  but
never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile
againi know that tooto think how changed he is </s>
<s>  you did the same
with me </s>
<s>   he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy
with a burst of affectionate emotion </s>
<s>  and i will say god bless you
now and show him how i love him for it </s>
<s> 

as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow
streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
within reasonable bounds </s>
<s>   there was sowerberrys the undertakers just
as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
remembered itthere were all the wellknown shops and houses with
almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedthere
was gamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old
publichouse doorthere was the workhouse the dreary prison of his
youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthere
was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver
involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so
foolish then cried then laughed againthere were scores of faces at
the doors and windows that he knew quite wellthere was nearly
everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life
had been but a happy dream </s>
<s> 

but it was pure earnest joyful reality </s>
<s>   they drove straight to the
door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe
and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
and size </s>
<s>  and here was <abvr> grimwig all ready to receive them kissing
the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as
if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness
and not offering to eat his headno not once </s>
<s>  not even when he
contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and
maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and
that time fast asleep </s>
<s>   there was dinner prepared and there were
bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first halfhour was
over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their
journey down </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained
in a separate room </s>
<s>   the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with
anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present
conversed apart </s>
<s>   once <abvr> maylie was called away and after being
absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping </s>
<s> 
all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets
nervous and uncomfortable </s>
<s>   they sat wondering in silence </s>
<s>  or if they
exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to
hear the sound of their own voices </s>
<s> 

at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they
were to hear no more that night <abvr> losberne and <abvr> grimwig entered
the room followed by <abvr> brownlow and a man whom oliver almost
shrieked with surprise to see </s>
<s>  for they told him it was his brother
and it was the same man he had met at the markettown and seen looking
in with fagin at the window of his little room </s>
<s>   monks cast a look of
hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy
and sat down near the door </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow who had papers in his hand
walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated </s>
<s> 

this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have
been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance
repeated here </s>
<s>   i would have spared you the degradation but we must
hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why </s>
<s> 

go on said the person addressed turning away his face </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s>   i
have almost done enough i think </s>
<s>   dont keep me here </s>

yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy </s>

<s>   he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he
slumbered on till next day when he died </s>
<s>   among the papers in his
desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed
to yourself </s>
<s>  he addressed himself to <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  and enclosed in a
few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package

papers was a letter to this girl agnes </s>

the letter </s>

none could ever give her back </s>
<s>   she was at that time within a few
months of her confinement </s>

her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse
his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on
her or their young child </s>
<s>  for all the guilt was his </s>
<s>   he reminded her
of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her
christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he
hoped one day to have bestowed upon herprayed her yet to keep it and

<s> 

monks was silent </s>
<s> 

the will said <abvr> brownlow speaking for him was in the same
spirit as the letter </s>
<s>   he talked of miseries which his wife had brought
upon him </s>
<s>  of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature
bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him </s>
<s>  and
left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds </s>
<s> 
the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for
agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born
alive and ever come of age </s>
<s>   if it were a girl it was to inherit the
money unconditionally </s>
<s>  but if a boy only on the stipulation that in
his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act

mark his confidence in the other and his convictiononly strengthened
by approaching deaththat the child would share her gentle heart and
noble nature </s>

money was to come to you </s>
<s>   for then and not till then when both
children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his
purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed
him with coldness and aversion </s>

chapter lii

fagins last night alive

the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces </s>
<s>  inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space </s>
<s>  from the rail before
the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries all looks were fixed upon one manfagin </s>
<s>   before him and
behind </s>
<s>   above below on the right and on the left </s>
<s>   he seemed to
stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes </s>
<s> 

he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand
resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and
his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater
distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was
delivering his charge to the jury </s>
<s>   at times he turned his eyes
sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight
in his favour </s>
<s>  and when the points against him were stated with
terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that
he would even then urge something in his behalf </s>
<s>   beyond these
manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot </s>
<s>   he had
scarcely moved since the trial began </s>
<s>  and now that the judge ceased to
speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close
attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still </s>
<s> 

a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself </s>
<s>   looking round
he saw that the juryman had turned together to consider their verdict </s>
<s> 
as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising
above each other to see his face </s>
<s>   some hastily applying their glasses
to their eyes </s>
<s>   and others whispering their neighbours with looks
expressive of abhorrence </s>
<s>   a few there were who seemed unmindful of
him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could
delay </s>
<s>   but in no one facenot even among the women of whom there
were many therecould he read the faintest sympathy with himself or
any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be
condemned </s>
<s> 

as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness
came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards
the judge </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 

they only sought permission to retire </s>
<s> 

he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed
out as though to see which way the greater number leant </s>
<s>  but that was
fruitless </s>
<s>   the jailer touched him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  he followed
mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair </s>
<s>   the man
pointed it out or he would not have seen it </s>
<s> 

he looked up into the gallery again </s>
<s>   some of the people were eating
and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs </s>
<s>  for the crowded place
was very hot </s>
<s>   there was one young man sketching his face in a little
notebook </s>
<s>   he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the
artist broke his pencilpoint and made another with his knife as any
idle spectator might have done </s>
<s> 

in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind
began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost
and how he put it on </s>
<s>   there was an old fat gentleman on the bench
too who had gone out some half an hour before and now come back </s>
<s>   he
wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner
what he had had and where he had had it </s>
<s>  and pursued this train of
careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused
another </s>
<s> 

not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one
oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet </s>
<s>  it
was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could
not fix his thoughts upon it </s>
<s>   thus even while he trembled and turned
burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron
spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken
off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was </s>
<s>   then he
thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffoldand stopped
to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool itand then went on to
think again </s>
<s> 

at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all
towards the door </s>
<s>   the jury returned and passed him close </s>
<s>  he could
glean nothing from their faces </s>
<s>  they might as well have been of stone </s>
<s> 
perfect stillness ensuednot a rustlenot a breathguilty </s>
<s> 

the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another
and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled
out like angry thunder </s>
<s>   it was a peal of joy from the populace
outside greeting the news that he would die on monday </s>
<s> 

the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him </s>
<s>  he had resumed his
listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the
demand was made </s>
<s>  but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it
and then he only muttered that he was an old manan old manand so
dropping into a whisper was silent again </s>
<s> 

the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the
same air and gesture </s>
<s>   a woman in the gallery uttered some
exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity </s>
<s>  he looked hastily up
as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively </s>
<s> 
the address was solemn and impressive </s>
<s>  the sentence fearful to hear </s>
<s> 
but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve </s>
<s>   his
haggard face was still thrust forward his underjaw hanging down and
his eyes staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his
arm and beckoned him away </s>
<s>   he gazed stupidly about him for an
instant and obeyed </s>
<s> 

they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners
were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their
friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard </s>
<s> 
there was nobody there to speak to him </s>
<s>  but as he passed the
prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were
clinging to the bars </s>
<s>   and they assailed him with opprobrious names
and screeched and hissed </s>
<s>   he shook his fist and would have spat upon
them </s>
<s>  but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage
lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison </s>
<s> 

here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of
anticipating the law </s>
<s>  this ceremony performed they led him to one of
the condemned cells and left him therealone </s>
<s> 

he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat
and bedstead </s>
<s>  and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to
collect his thoughts </s>
<s>  after awhile he began to remember a few
disjointed fragments of what the judge had said </s>
<s>  though it had seemed
to him at the time that he could not hear a word </s>
<s>   these gradually
fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more </s>
<s>   so that
in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered </s>
<s>   to be
hanged by the neck till he was deadthat was the end </s>
<s>   to be hanged
by the neck till he was dead </s>
<s> 

as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known
who had died upon the scaffold </s>
<s>  some of them through his means </s>
<s>   they
rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them </s>
<s>   he
had seen some of them dieand had joked too because they died with
prayers upon their lips </s>
<s>   with what a rattling noise the drop went
down </s>
<s>  and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to
dangling heaps of clothes </s>
<s> 

some of them might have inhabited that very cellsat upon that very
spot </s>
<s>   it was very dark </s>
<s>  why didnt they bring a light </s>
<s>   the cell had
been built for many years </s>
<s>   scores of men must have passed their last
hours there </s>
<s>   it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead
bodiesthe cap the noose the pinioned arms the faces that he knew
even beneath that hideous veil </s>
<s> light light </s>
<s> 

at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door
and walls two men appeared </s>
<s>   one bearing a candle which he thrust
into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall </s>
<s>   the other dragging in
a mattress on which to pass the night </s>
<s>  for the prisoner was to be left
alone no more </s>
<s> 

then came the nightdark dismal silent night </s>
<s>   other watchers are
glad to hear this churchclock strike for they tell of life and coming
day </s>
<s>   to him they brought despair </s>
<s>   the boom of every iron bell came
laden with the one deep hollow sounddeath </s>
<s>  what availed the noise
and bustle of cheerful morning which penetrated even there to him </s>
<s> 
it was another form of knell with mockery added to the warning </s>
<s> 

the day passed off </s>
<s>   day </s>
<s>   there was no day </s>
<s>  it was gone as soon as
comeand night came on again </s>
<s>  night so long and yet so short </s>
<s>  long in
its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours </s>
<s>   at one time he
raved and blasphemed </s>
<s>  and at another howled and tore his hair </s>
<s> 
venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he
had driven them away with curses </s>
<s>   they renewed their charitable
efforts and he beat them off </s>
<s> 

saturday night </s>
<s>   he had only one night more to live </s>
<s>   and as he thought
of this the day brokesunday </s>
<s> 

it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering
sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon
his blighted soul </s>
<s>  not that he had ever held any defined or positive
hope of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than
the dim probability of dying so soon </s>
<s>  he had spoken little to either of
the two men who relieved each other in their attendance upon him </s>
<s>  and
they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention </s>
<s>   he had
sat there awake but dreaming </s>
<s>   now he started up every minute and
with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even theyused to such
sightsrecoiled from him with horror </s>
<s>   he grew so terrible at last
in all the tortures of his evil conscience that one man could not bear
to sit there eyeing him alone </s>
<s>  and so the two kept watch together </s>
<s> 

he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the past </s>
<s>  he had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth </s>
<s>   his red hair
hung down upon his bloodless face </s>
<s>  his beard was torn and twisted into
knots </s>
<s>  his eyes shone with a terrible light </s>
<s>  his unwashed flesh
crackled with the fever that burnt him up </s>
<s>  eightninethen </s>
<s>   if it
was not a trick to frighten him and those were the real hours treading
on each others heels where would he be when they came round again </s>
<s> 
eleven </s>
<s>   another struck before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate </s>
<s>   at eight he would be the only mourner in his own
funeral train </s>
<s>  at eleven

those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and
such unspeakable anguish not only from the eyes but too often and
too long from the thoughts of men never held so dread a spectacle as
that </s>
<s>   the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the man
was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow would have slept but ill that
night if they could have seen him </s>
<s> 

from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two
and three presented themselves at the lodgegate and inquired with
anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received </s>
<s>   these being
answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to
clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from
which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built
and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the
scene </s>
<s>   by degrees they fell off one by one </s>
<s>  and for an hour in the
dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness </s>
<s> 

the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers
painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd when <abvr> brownlow and oliver appeared
at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner
signed by one of the sheriffs </s>
<s>   they were immediately admitted into the
lodge </s>
<s> 

is the young gentleman to come too sir </s>
<s>  said the man whose duty it
was to conduct them </s>
<s>   its not a sight for children sir </s>
<s> 

it is not indeed my friend rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  but my business
with this man is intimately connected with him </s>
<s>  and as this child has
seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as
welleven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him
now </s>
<s> 

these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver </s>
<s> 
the man touched his hat </s>
<s>  and glancing at oliver with some curiousity
opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and
led them on through dark and winding ways towards the cells </s>
<s> 

this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
workmen were making some preparations in profound silencethis is the
place he passes through </s>
<s>   if you step this way you can see the door he
goes out at </s>
<s> 

he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the
prison food and pointed to a door </s>
<s>   there was an open grating above
it through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the
noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards </s>
<s>   they were
putting up the scaffold </s>
<s> 

from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by
other turnkeys from the inner side </s>
<s>  and having entered an open yard
ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row
of strong doors on the left hand </s>
<s>   motioning them to remain where they
were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys </s>
<s>  the
two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage
stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned
the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell </s>
<s>   they did so </s>
<s> 

the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side
to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
face of a man </s>
<s>   his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for
he continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence
otherwise than as a part of his vision </s>

as he spoke he caught sight of oliver and <abvr> brownlow </s>

the furthest corner of the seat he demanded to know what they wanted
there </s>

<s>   now sir tell

time gets on </s>

the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned </s>

<s>  faster
faster </s>
<s> 

the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp
held him back </s>
<s>   he struggled with the power of desperation for an
instant </s>
<s>  and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those

and simple words </s>

before three months had passed rose fleming and harry maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergymans labours </s>
<s>  on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  maylie took up her abode with her son and daughterinlaw to
enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her days the greatest felicity
that age and worth can knowthe contemplation of the happiness of
those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a
wellspent life have been unceasingly bestowed </s>
<s> 

it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered
either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided
between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than
three thousand pounds </s>
<s>   by the provisions of his fathers will oliver
would have been entitled to the whole </s>
<s>  but <abvr> brownlow unwilling to
deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices
and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to
which his young charge joyfully acceded </s>
<s> 

monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a
distant part of the new world </s>
<s>  where having quickly squandered it he
once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk
under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison </s>
<s>   as far from
home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagins gang </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow adopted oliver as his son </s>
<s>   removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonagehouse where his dear
friends resided he gratified the only remaining wish of olivers warm
and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world </s>
<s> 

soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned
to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would
have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a
feeling </s>
<s>  and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how </s>
<s>   for
two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared
the air began to disagree with him </s>
<s>  then finding that the place really
no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his
assistant took a bachelors cottage outside the village of which his
young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered </s>
<s>   here he took
to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other
pursuits of a similar kind </s>
<s>   all undertaken with his characteristic
impetuosity </s>
<s>   in each and all he has since become famous throughout the
neighborhood as a most profound authority </s>
<s> 

before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated </s>
<s>   he
is accordingly visited by <abvr> grimwig a great many times in the course
of the year </s>
<s>   on all such occasions <abvr> grimwig plants fishes and
carpenters with great ardour </s>
<s>  doing everything in a very singular and
unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite
asseveration that his mode is the right one </s>
<s>   on sundays he never
fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergymans face </s>
<s>   always
informing <abvr> losberne in strict confidence afterwards that he
considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say
so </s>
<s>   it is a standing and very favourite joke for <abvr> brownlow to
rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of
the night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his
return </s>
<s>  but <abvr> grimwig contends that he was right in the main and in
proof thereof remarks that oliver did not come back after all </s>
<s>  which
always calls forth a laugh on his side and increases his good humour </s>

consequence of being admitted approver against fagin </s>
<s>   and considering
his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish </s>
<s>   was for
some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened
with too much work </s>
<s>   after some consideration he went into business as
an informer in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence </s>
<s>   his
plan is to walk out once a week during church time attended by
charlotte in respectable attire </s>
<s>   the lady faints away at the doors of
charitable publicans and the gentleman being accommodated with
threepenny worth of brandy to restore her lays an information next
day and pockets half the penalty </s>
<s>   sometimes <abvr> claypole faints
himself but the result is the same </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bumble deprived of their situations were gradually
reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in
that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others </s>

mr </s>
<s>  bumble has been heard to say that in this reverse and degradation
he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his
wife </s>

as to <abvr> giles and brittles they still remain in their old posts
although the former is bald and the lastnamed boy quite grey </s>
<s>   they
sleep at the parsonage but divide their attentions so equally among
its inmates and oliver and <abvr> brownlow and <abvr> losberne that to
this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which
establishment they properly belong </s>
<s> 

master charles bates appalled by sikess crime fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best </s>
<s> 
arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back
upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of
action </s>
<s>   he struggled hard and suffered much for some time </s>
<s>  but
having a contented disposition and a good purpose succeeded in the
end </s>
<s>  and from being a farmers drudge and a carriers lad he is now
the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire </s>
<s> 

and now the hand that traces these words falters as it approaches
the conclusion of its task </s>
<s>  and would weave for a little longer space
the thread of these adventures </s>
<s> 

i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long
moved and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it </s>
<s>   i would
show rose maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood
shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light that fell
on all who trod it with her and shone into their hearts </s>
<s>   i would
paint her the life and joy of the fireside circle and the lively
summer group </s>
<s>  i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon and
hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk </s>
<s>  i
would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling
untiring discharge of domestic duties at home </s>
<s>  i would paint her and
her dead sisters child happy in their love for one another and
passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so
sadly lost </s>
<s>  i would summon before me once again those joyous little
faces that clustered round her knee and listen to their merry prattle </s>

i would recall the tones of that clear laugh and conjure up the
sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye </s>

thousand looks and smiles and turns of thought and speechi would
fain recall them every one </s>

how <abvr> brownlow went on from day to day filling the mind of his
adopted child with stores of knowledge and becoming attached to him
more and more as his nature developed itself and showed the thriving
seeds of all he wished him to becomehow he traced in him new traits
of his early friend that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances
melancholy and yet sweet and soothinghow the two orphans tried by
adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love
and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved themthese
are all matters which need not to be told </s>

truly happy </s>

gratitude to that being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute

tablet which bears as yet but one word </s>

earth to visit spots hallowed by the lovethe love beyond the
