she has found out some new friends my dear and i must know who they

that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and
equipped in his carters dress </s>

fagin </s>
<s>   six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin
came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was

exultation he could not conceal </s>

she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im
sure </s>

not be back much before daybreak </s>
<s>   come with me </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s> 

noah started up without saying a word </s>
<s>  for the jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him </s>
<s>   they left the house
stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at
length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in
which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london </s>
<s> 

it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed </s>
<s>   it opened softly
on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle </s>
<s>  they entered without noise </s>
<s> 
and the door was closed behind them </s>
<s> 

scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words
fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of
glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in
the adjoining room </s>
<s> 

is that the woman </s>
<s>  he asked scarcely above his breath </s>

fagin nodded yes </s>

i cant see her face well whispered noah </s>

the candle is behind her </s>

stay there whispered fagin </s>

an instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of
snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking
to the girl caused her to raise her face </s>

i see her now cried the spy </s>

plainly </s>
<s> 

i should know her among a thousand </s>

he hastily descended as the roomdoor opened and the girl came out </s>

fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and
they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered </s>

noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out </s>

he did so </s>

figure already at some distance before him </s>
<s>   he advanced as near as he
considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the
better to observe her motions </s>

thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
her pass on </s>

walk with a steadier and firmer step </s>

chapter xlvi

the appointment kept

the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures
emerged on london bridge </s>
<s>   one which advanced with a swift and rapid
step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in
quest of some expected object </s>
<s>  the other figure was that of a man who
slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance
accommodated his pace to hers </s>
<s>   stopping when she stopped </s>
<s>   and as she
moved again creeping stealthily on </s>
<s>   but never allowing himself in
the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps </s>
<s>   thus they
crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the
woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the
footpassengers turned back </s>
<s>   the movement was sudden </s>
<s>  but he who
watched her was not thrown off his guard by it </s>
<s>  for shrinking into
one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning
over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to
pass on the opposite pavement </s>
<s>  when she was about the same distance in
advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed
her again </s>
<s>  at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped </s>
<s>   the man
stopped too </s>
<s> 

it was a very dark night </s>
<s>   the day had been unfavourable and at that
hour and place there were few people stirring </s>
<s>  such as there were
hurried quickly past </s>
<s>   very possibly without seeing but certainly
without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view </s>
<s> 
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way
over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless
hovel wherein to lay their heads </s>
<s>  they stood there in silence </s>
<s>   neither
speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed </s>
<s> 

a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks </s>
<s> 
the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull
from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water
too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes </s>
<s>  the tower of old
saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the
giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom </s>
<s>  but the
forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of
churches above were nearly all hidden from sight </s>
<s> 

the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched
meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st </s>
<s>  pauls
tolled for the death of another day </s>
<s>   midnight had come upon the
crowded city </s>
<s>   the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse </s>
<s> 
s </s>
<s>   midnight was upon them
all </s>
<s> 

the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by
a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a
short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked
straight towards it </s>
<s>   they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement
when the girl started and immediately made towards them </s>
<s> 

they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who
entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate </s>
<s> 
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it
immediately </s>
<s>  for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment </s>
<s> 

not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here </s>
<s> 
come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder </s>
<s> 

as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction
in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on </s>
<s> 

the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the
surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours
church form a landingstairs from the river </s>
<s>   to this spot the man
bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved </s>
<s>  and after
a moments survey of the place he began to descend </s>
<s> 

these stairs are a part of the bridge </s>
<s>  they consist of three flights </s>
<s> 
just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the
left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames </s>
<s> 
at this point the lower steps widen </s>
<s>   so that a person turning that
angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs
who chance to be above him if only a step </s>
<s>  the countryman looked
hastily round when he reached this point </s>
<s>  and as there seemed no
better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty
of room he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there
waited </s>
<s>   pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if
he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with
safety </s>
<s> 

so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he
had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for
lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or
had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
conversation </s>
<s>   he was on the point of emerging from his hidingplace
and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and
directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear </s>
<s> 

he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely
breathing listened attentively </s>
<s> 

this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the
gentleman </s>
<s>   i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther </s>
<s>   many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but
you see i am willing to humour you </s>
<s> 

to humour me </s>
<s>  cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed </s>
<s> 
youre considerate indeed sir </s>
<s>   to humour me </s>
<s>   well well its no
matter </s>
<s> 

why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose
can you have brought us to this strange place </s>
<s>   why not have let me
speak to you above there where it is light and there is something
stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole </s>
<s> 

i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you
there </s>
<s>   i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have
such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand </s>
<s> 

a fear of what </s>
<s>  asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her </s>
<s> 

i scarcely know of what replied the girl </s>
<s>   i wish i did </s>
<s>  horrible
thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that
has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day </s>
<s>   i was
reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things
came into the print </s>
<s> 

imagination said the gentleman soothing her </s>
<s> 

no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice </s>
<s>  ill swear i saw
coffin written in every page of the book in large black
lettersaye and they carried one close to me in the streets
tonight </s>
<s> 

there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman </s>
<s>  they have
passed me often </s>
<s> 

real ones rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   this was not </s>
<s> 

there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the
concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and
the blood chilled within him </s>
<s>   he had never experienced a greater
relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged
her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such
fearful fancies </s>
<s> 

speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion </s>
<s>  poor
creature </s>
<s>   she seems to need it </s>
<s> 

your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the
girl </s>
<s>   oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks
as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth
and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud
instead of so much humbler </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the gentleman </s>
<s>   a turk turns his face after washing it
well to the east when he says his prayers </s>
<s>  these good people after
giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles
off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven </s>
<s> 
between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first </s>
<s> 

these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were
perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover
herself </s>
<s>   the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her </s>
<s> 

you were not here last sunday night he said </s>
<s> 

i couldnt come replied nancy </s>
<s>  i was kept by force </s>
<s> 

by whom </s>
<s> 

him that i told the young lady of before </s>
<s> 

you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope </s>
<s>  asked the old
gentleman </s>
<s> 

no replied the girl shaking her head </s>
<s>   its not very easy for me
to leave him unless he knows why </s>
<s>  i couldnt give him a drink of
laudanum before i came away </s>
<s> 

did he awake before you returned </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  and neither he nor any of them suspect me </s>
<s> 

good said the gentleman </s>
<s>   now listen to me </s>
<s> 

i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment </s>
<s> 

this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to
some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly
a fortnight since </s>
<s>   i confess to you that i had doubts at first
whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe
you are </s>
<s> 

i am said the girl earnestly </s>
<s> 

i repeat that i firmly believe it </s>
<s>   to prove to you that i am disposed
to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the
secret whatever it may be from the fear of this man monks </s>
<s>   but
ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured
cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew </s>
<s> 

fagin cried the girl recoiling </s>
<s> 

that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman </s>
<s> 

i will not do it </s>
<s>   i will never do it </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>  devil that
he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that </s>
<s> 

you will not </s>
<s>  said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this
answer </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  returned the girl </s>
<s> 

tell me why </s>
<s> 

for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the
lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her
promise </s>
<s>   and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has
led i have led a bad life too </s>
<s>  there are many of us who have kept the
same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of
themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are </s>
<s> 

then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he
had been aiming to attain </s>
<s>  put monks into my hands and leave him to
me to deal with </s>
<s> 

what if he turns against the others </s>
<s> 

i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him
there the matter will rest </s>
<s>  there must be circumstances in olivers
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye
and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free </s>
<s> 

and if it is not </s>
<s>  suggested the girl </s>
<s> 

then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to
justice without your consent </s>
<s>   in such a case i could show you reasons
i think which would induce you to yield it </s>
<s> 

have i the ladys promise for that </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

you have replied rose </s>
<s>   my true and faithful pledge </s>
<s> 

monks would never learn how you knew what you do </s>
<s>  said the girl
after a short pause </s>
<s> 

never replied the gentleman </s>
<s>   the intelligence should be brought to
bear upon him that he could never even guess </s>
<s> 

i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the
girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words </s>
<s> 

after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so
she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by
name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that
night </s>
<s>   from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared
as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
communicated </s>
<s>   when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the
place the best position from which to watch it without exciting
observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the
habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for
the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to
her recollection </s>
<s> 

he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout </s>
<s> 
he has a lurking walk </s>
<s>  and as he walks constantly looks over his
shoulder first on one side and then on the other </s>
<s>  dont forget that
for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans
that you might almost tell him by that alone </s>
<s>   his face is dark like
his hair and eyes </s>
<s>  and although he cant be more than six or eight and
twenty withered and haggard </s>
<s>  his lips are often discoloured and
disfigured with the marks of teeth </s>
<s>  for he has desperate fits and
sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you
start </s>
<s>  said the girl stopping suddenly </s>
<s> 

the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious
of having done so and begged her to proceed </s>
<s> 

part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at
the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times
he was covered up in a large cloak </s>
<s>   i think thats all i can give you
to know him by </s>
<s>   stay though she added </s>
<s>   upon his throat </s>
<s>   so high
that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his
face </s>
<s>   there is

a broad red mark like a burn or scald </s>
<s>  cried the gentleman </s>
<s> 

hows this </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   you know him </s>
<s> 

the young lady uttered a cry of surprise and for a few moments they
were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe </s>
<s> 

i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence </s>
<s>   i should by
your description </s>
<s>   we shall see </s>
<s>   many people are singularly like each
other </s>
<s>   it may not be the same </s>
<s> 

as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he
took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell
from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he </s>
<s> 

now he said returning </s>
<s>   so it seemed by the sound </s>
<s>   to the spot
where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance
young woman and i wish you to be the better for it </s>
<s>  what can i do to
serve you </s>
<s> 

nothing replied nancy </s>
<s> 

you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a
voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder
and more obdurate heart </s>
<s>  think now </s>
<s>   tell me </s>
<s> 

nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping </s>
<s>   you can do nothing to
help me </s>
<s>   i am past all hope indeed </s>
<s> 

you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman </s>
<s>  the past has
been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such
priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never
grants again but for the future you may hope </s>
<s>  i do not say that it
is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must
come as you seek it </s>
<s>  but a quiet asylum either in england or if you
fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the
compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you </s>
<s>  before
the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of
daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your
former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind
you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment </s>

<s>   i
would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion

she will be persuaded now cried the young lady </s>
<s>   she hesitates i
am sure </s>
<s> 

i fear not my dear said the gentleman </s>
<s> 

no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle </s>
<s>   i am
chained to my old life </s>
<s>   i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave
it </s>
<s>   i must have gone too far to turn backand yet i dont know for

off </s>
<s>   but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me
again </s>
<s>   i must go home </s>
<s> 

home </s>
<s>  repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word </s>

home lady rejoined the girl </s>

<s>   we compromise her
safety perhaps by staying here </s>
<s>   we may have detained her longer than
she expected already </s>
<s> 

yes yes urged the girl </s>

<s> 

do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing </s>

<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   goodnight goodnight </s>

the gentleman turned away </s>

<s> 

the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some
discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to
determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested </s>
<s> 

the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased </s>

the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
appeared upon the bridge </s>

rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his
and led her with gentle force away </s>
<s>   as they disappeared the girl
sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and
vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears </s>

after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street </s>

glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his
hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in

fatal consequences

it was nearly two hours before daybreak </s>
<s>  that time which in the autumn
of the year may be truly called the dead of night </s>
<s>  when the streets
are silent and deserted </s>
<s>  when even sounds appear to slumber and
profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream </s>
<s>  it was at this still
and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so
distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less
like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and
worried by an evil spirit </s>
<s> 

he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet
with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his side </s>
<s>   his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed
in thought he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his
toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats </s>
<s> 

stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep </s>
<s> 
towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and
then brought them back again to the candle </s>
<s>  which with a longburnt
wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon
the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere </s>
<s> 

indeed they were </s>
<s>   mortification at the overthrow of his notable
scheme </s>
<s>  hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers </s>
<s>  and
utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up </s>
<s>  bitter
disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes </s>
<s>  the fear of
detection and ruin and death </s>
<s>  and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all </s>
<s>  these were the passionate considerations which following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain
of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his
heart </s>
<s> 

he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take
the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted
by a footstep in the street </s>
<s> 

at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth </s>
<s>  at last </s>

wildly and furiously up the stairs </s>

the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was

sikes made no reply </s>

turned the lock dashed into the silent streets </s>

without one pause or moments consideration </s>

head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering
them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage
resolution </s>

stairs </s>

there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the
candlestick and hurled it under the grate </s>

bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like

the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils

dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the
door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth </s>

the housebreaker freed one arm and grasped his pistol </s>

fancy the eyes and imagine them moving towards him than to see them

off again </s>

shut the door softly locked it took the key and left the house </s>

mounted the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the

towards london by the highroadthen back againthen over another

down in fields and lying on ditches brinks to rest and starting up

and drink </s>

when he got there all the people he metthe very children at the
doorsseemed to view him with suspicion </s>
<s>   back he turned again
without the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no
food for many hours </s>

where to go </s>

he wandered over miles and miles of ground and still came back to the
old place </s>
<s>   morning and noon had passed and the day was on the wane
and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round
and still lingered about the same spot </s>
<s>   at last he got away and
shaped his course for hatfield </s>
<s> 

it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the
dog limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the
hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little
street crept into a small publichouse whose scanty light had guided
them to the spot </s>

cast a morsel of food from time to time </s>

upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous

from hatfield to st </s>

he went on doggedly </s>

<s>  every object before him
substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some
fearful thing </s>

haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following at his heels </s>
<s> 
he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the
outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along </s>

could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of
wind came laden with that last low cry </s>

<s>   that would have been a
relief </s>

his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was
behind him then </s>

himself upon the roadon his back upon the road </s>

stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph

night </s>

very dark within </s>

himself close to the wallto undergo new torture </s>

him </s>

brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog who careered
with loud and sounding bark before him </s>
<s> 

he came upon the spot </s>
<s>   there were halfdressed figures tearing to and
fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables
others driving the cattle from the yard and outhouses and others
coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks
and the tumbling down of redhot beams </s>
<s>   the apertures where doors and
windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire </s>
<s>  walls
rocked and crumbled into the burning well </s>
<s>  the molten lead and iron
poured down white hot upon the ground </s>
<s>   women and children shrieked
and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers </s>
<s>   the
clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water
as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar </s>
<s>   he
shouted too till he was hoarse </s>
<s>  and flying from memory and himself
plunged into the thickest of the throng </s>
<s>   hither and thither he dived
that night </s>
<s>   now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the
smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
men were thickest </s>
<s>   up and down the ladders upon the roofs of
buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under
the lee of falling bricks and stones in every part of that great fire
was he </s>
<s>  but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise
nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke
and blackened ruins remained </s>
<s> 

this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the
dreadful consciousness of his crime </s>
<s>   he looked suspiciously about him
for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject
of their talk </s>
<s>   the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and
they drew off stealthily together </s>
<s>   he passed near an engine where
some men were seated and they called to him to share in their
refreshment </s>

beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the
murder </s>
<s>   he has gone to birmingham they say said one </s>
<s>   but theyll
have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell
be a cry all through the country </s>
<s> 

he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground </s>
<s>  then
lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep </s>
<s>   he
wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the
fear of another solitary night </s>

suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london </s>

<s> 

he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least

within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by
a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
fixed on for his destination </s>

resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond </s>

were making </s>

brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright </s>

called him again </s>

the men obeyed and the two were left alone together </s>

this is pretty treatment sir said monks throwing down his hat and
cloak from my fathers oldest friend </s>

it is because i was your fathers oldest friend young man returned

years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and

designation after a long silence during which he had jerked himself

you have a brother said <abvr> brownlow rousing himself </s>

heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both </s>

looks they could assume </s>
<s>   your mother succeeded </s>

but it rusted and cankered at your fathers heart for years </s>

well they were separated said monks and what of that </s>

when they had been separated for some time returned <abvr> brownlow
and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had
utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who
with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new
friends </s>

not i said monks turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon

your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never

the pursuit and escape

near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe
abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on

ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
of warehouses that rise from every corner </s>

streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has

of desolation and neglect </s>

why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so

especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping

there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon

while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their

if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he
did it </s>

behind </s>

easy </s>

this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the
right </s>

it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and

together starting at every sound </s>

they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below </s>

young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he
felt himself </s>

the knocking came again </s>

crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head </s>

there was no need to tell them who it was </s>

the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the door </s>

we must let him in he said taking up the candle </s>

isnt there any help for it </s>

none </s>

dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the
chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he had finished </s>

crackit went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the

he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room

over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it
would goand ground it against itand sat down </s>
<s> 

not a word had been exchanged </s>

silence </s>

alone </s>

tonights paper says that fagins took </s>

they were silent again </s>

damn you all </s>

have you nothing to say to me </s>
<s> 

there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke </s>
<s> 

you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit
do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over </s>
<s> 

you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person
addressed after some hesitation </s>
<s> 

sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him </s>
<s>   rather trying to
turn his head than actually doing it </s>
<s>   and said isitthe bodyis
it buried </s>

they shook their heads </s>

why isnt it </s>

crackit intimated by a motion of his hand as he left the room that
there was nothing to fear </s>
<s>  and directly came back with charley bates
behind him </s>
<s>   sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy
entered the room he encountered his figure </s>
<s> 

toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards
him why didnt you tell me this downstairs </s>
<s> 

there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the
three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad </s>
<s> 
accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with him </s>
<s> 

let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still
farther </s>

charley </s>

<s>   dont youdont you know
me </s>
<s> 

dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and
looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face </s>
<s>   you
monster </s>
<s> 

the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other </s>
<s>  but sikess
eyes sunk gradually to the ground </s>
<s> 

witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and
becoming more and more excited as he spoke </s>
<s>  witness you threeim not
afraid of himif they come here after him ill give him up </s>

you three youll help me </s>
<s>   murder </s>
<s>   help </s>
<s>   down with him </s>
<s> 

pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent
gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the
strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of
his surprise brought him heavily to the ground </s>
<s> 

the three spectators seemed quite stupefied </s>
<s>   they offered no
interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together </s>
<s>  the
former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his
hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast
and never ceasing to call for help with all his might </s>
<s> 

the contest however was too unequal to last long </s>
<s>   sikes had him
down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with
a look of alarm and pointed to the window </s>
<s>   there were lights gleaming
below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried
footstepsendless they seemed in numbercrossing the nearest wooden
bridge </s>
<s>   one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd </s>
<s>  for there
was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement </s>
<s>   the gleam of
lights increased </s>
<s>  the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on </s>
<s> 
then came a loud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from
such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail </s>

help </s>
<s>  shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air </s>
<s> 

hes here </s>

in the kings name cried the voices without </s>

arose again but louder </s>

<s>  screamed the boy </s>
<s>   i tell you theyll never
open it </s>
<s>   run straight to the room where the light is </s>
<s>  break down the
door </s>
<s> 

strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower
windowshutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the
crowd </s>
<s>  giving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of
its immense extent </s>
<s> 

open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching
hellbabe cried sikes fiercely </s>
<s>  running to and fro and dragging the
boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack </s>
<s>  that door </s>
<s>   quick </s>
<s> 
he flung him in bolted it and turned the key </s>

door fast </s>

doublelocked and chained replied crackit who with the other two
men still remained quite helpless and bewildered </s>

lined with sheetiron </s>

yes and the windows </s>

damn you </s>
<s>  cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd </s>
<s>   do your worst </s>
<s>   ill cheat you yet </s>
<s> 

of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could
exceed the cry of the infuriated throng </s>
<s>   some shouted to those who
were nearest to set the house on fire </s>
<s>  others roared to the officers to
shoot him dead </s>
<s>   among them all none showed such fury as the man on
horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting
through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the
window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the
man who brings a ladder </s>
<s> 

the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it </s>
<s>   some
called for ladders some for sledgehammers </s>
<s>  some ran with torches to
and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again </s>
<s>  some
spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations </s>
<s>  some pressed
forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of
those below </s>
<s>  some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the
waterspout and crevices in the wall </s>
<s>  and all waved to and fro in the
darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind </s>
<s>   and
joined from time to time in one loud furious roar </s>
<s> 

the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the room and
shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up </s>
<s>  give me a rope a
long rope </s>
<s>   theyre all in front </s>
<s>   i may drop into the folly ditch and
clear off that way </s>
<s>   give me a rope or i shall do three more murders
and kill myself </s>
<s> 

the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept </s>
<s>  the
murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up
to the housetop </s>
<s> 

all the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up
except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that
was too small even for the passage of his body </s>
<s>   but from this
aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the
back </s>
<s>  and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by
the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in
an unbroken stream </s>
<s> 

he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose
so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
to open it from the inside </s>
<s>  and creeping over the tiles looked over
the low parapet </s>
<s> 

the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud </s>
<s> 

the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his
motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it
and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
which all their previous shouting had been whispers </s>
<s>   again and again
it rose </s>
<s>   those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning
took up the sound </s>
<s>  it echoed and reechoed </s>
<s>  it seemed as though the
whole city had poured its population out to curse him </s>
<s> 

on pressed the people from the fronton on on in a strong
struggling current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch
to lighten them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion </s>
<s> 
the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the
mob </s>
<s>  sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out </s>
<s>  there were tiers and
tiers of faces in every window </s>
<s>  cluster upon cluster of people clinging
to every housetop </s>
<s>   each little bridge and there were three in sight
bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it </s>
<s>   still the current poured
on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only
for an instant see the wretch </s>
<s> 

they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge </s>
<s>  hurrah </s>
<s> 

the crowd grew light with uncovered heads </s>
<s>  and again the shout uprose </s>
<s> 

i will give fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter to the man who takes him alive </s>
<s>   i will remain here till he
come to ask me for it </s>
<s> 

there was another roar </s>
<s>   at this moment the word was passed among the
crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first
called for the ladder had mounted into the room </s>
<s>   the stream abruptly
turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth </s>
<s>  and the people at
the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their
stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now
thronged pellmell to the spot they had left </s>
<s>   each man crushing and
striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near
the door and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out </s>
<s> 
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation
or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion were
dreadful </s>
<s>  the narrow ways were completely blocked up </s>
<s>  and at this time
between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and
the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the
mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer
although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible
increased </s>
<s> 

the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
crowd and the impossibility of escape </s>
<s>  but seeing this sudden change
with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his feet
determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the
ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in
the darkness and confusion </s>
<s> 

roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within
the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he
set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the
rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong
running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second </s>
<s>   he
could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the
ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut
it then and drop </s>
<s> 

at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to
slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman
beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly
warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat
that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw
his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror </s>
<s> 

the eyes again </s>
<s>  he cried in an unearthly screech </s>
<s> 

staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled
over the parapet </s>
<s>   the noose was on his neck </s>
<s>  it ran up with his
weight tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speeds </s>
<s>   he
fell for fiveandthirty feet </s>
<s>   there was a sudden jerk a terrific
convulsion of the limbs </s>
<s>  and there he hung with the open knife
clenched in his stiffening hand </s>
<s> 

the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely </s>
<s>  the
murderer swung lifeless against the wall </s>
<s>  and the boy thrusting aside
the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come
and take him out for gods sake </s>
<s> 

a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on
the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring
jumped for the dead mans shoulders </s>
<s>  missing his aim he fell into the
ditch turning completely over as he went </s>

against a stone dashed out his brains </s>

a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney

the events narrated in the last </s>
<s> were yet but two days old when
oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a
travellingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie
and rose and <abvr> bedwin and the good doctor were with him </s>
<s>   and <abvr>
brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned </s>
<s> 

they had not talked much upon the way </s>
<s>  for oliver was in a flutter of
agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less
effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree </s>
<s> 
he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by <abvr>
brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
monks </s>
<s>  and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense </s>
<s> 

the same kind friend had with <abvr> losbernes assistance cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place </s>
<s> 
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long
but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be
at a worse </s>
<s>   so they travelled on in silence </s>
<s>   each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together </s>
<s>   and no one
disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all </s>
<s> 

but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they
journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the
whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a
crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into
that which he had traversed on foot </s>
<s>   a poor houseless wandering boy
without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head </s>
<s> 

see there there </s>
<s>  cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose
and pointing out at the carriage window </s>
<s>  thats the stile i came over </s>
<s> 
there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake
me and force me back </s>
<s>   yonder is the path across the fields leading to
the old house where i was a little child </s>
<s>   oh dick dick my dear old
friend if i could only see you now </s>
<s> 

you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands
between her own </s>
<s>   you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich
you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great
as the coming back to make him happy too </s>
<s> 

yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and
have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place
where he may grow strong and wellshall we </s>
<s> 

rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak </s>
<s> 

you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said
oliver </s>
<s>   it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell </s>
<s>  but
never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile
againi know that tooto think how changed he is </s>
<s>  you did the same
with me </s>
<s>   he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy
with a burst of affectionate emotion </s>
<s>  and i will say god bless you
now and show him how i love him for it </s>
<s> 

as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow
streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
within reasonable bounds </s>
<s>   there was sowerberrys the undertakers just
as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
remembered itthere were all the wellknown shops and houses with
almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedthere
was gamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old
publichouse doorthere was the workhouse the dreary prison of his
youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthere
was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver
involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so
foolish then cried then laughed againthere were scores of faces at
the doors and windows that he knew quite wellthere was nearly
everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life
had been but a happy dream </s>
<s> 

but it was pure earnest joyful reality </s>
<s>   they drove straight to the
door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe
and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
and size </s>
<s>  and here was <abvr> grimwig all ready to receive them kissing
the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as

<s>  not even when he
contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and

that time fast asleep </s>

bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic </s>

journey down </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained
in a separate room </s>

anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present
conversed apart </s>

absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping </s>

all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets
nervous and uncomfortable </s>
<s>   they sat wondering in silence </s>
<s>  or if they
exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to
hear the sound of their own voices </s>
<s> 

at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they
were to hear no more that night <abvr> losberne and <abvr> grimwig entered
the room followed by <abvr> brownlow and a man whom oliver almost
shrieked with surprise to see </s>
<s>  for they told him it was his brother

in with fagin at the window of his little room </s>
<s>   monks cast a look of
hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy

<s>   <abvr> brownlow who had papers in his hand
walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated </s>

the letter </s>

the will said <abvr> brownlow speaking for him was in the same

as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on

sir </s>

<s> 

this salutation was addressed to <abvr> brownlow who had stepped up to
within a short distance of the respectable couple </s>

pointed to monks

do you know that person </s>

no replied <abvr> bumble flatly </s>

perhaps you dont </s>

i never saw him in all my life said <abvr> bumble </s>

no replied <abvr> bumble </s>

you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring </s>

brownlow </s>

certainly not replied the matron </s>

again <abvr> brownlow nodded to <abvr> grimwig </s>

limped away with extraordinary readiness </s>

with a stout man and wife </s>

we heard her try to tell you what shed done and saw you take a paper

often long ago that the young mother had told her that feeling she

taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child </s>

would you like to see the pawnbroker himself </s>

a motion towards the door </s>

nothing replied <abvr> brownlow except that it remains for us to take

you may leave the room </s>

indeed it will replied <abvr> brownlow </s>

looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room </s>
<s> 

that is no excuse replied <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   you were present on the
occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more
guilty of the two in the eye of the law </s>

your wife acts under your direction </s>

the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said <abvr>
brownlow </s>

<s> 

the child replied monks when her father died in a strange place
in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that
yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be

as their own </s>

child </s>

she took it did she </s>

no </s>

their discontent and poverty for the childs unhappiness but told the
history of the sisters shame with such alterations as suited her </s>

bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood </s>

told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or
other </s>
<s>   the circumstances countenanced all this </s>

it </s>

to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the
girl by chance pitied her and took her home </s>
<s>   there was some cursed
spell i think against us </s>

remained there and was happy </s>

chapter lii

fagins last night alive

the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces </s>
<s>  inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space </s>
<s>  from the rail before
the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries all looks were fixed upon one manfagin </s>
<s>   before him and
behind </s>
<s>   above below on the right and on the left </s>
<s>   he seemed to
stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes </s>
<s> 

he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand
resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and
his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater
distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was
delivering his charge to the jury </s>
<s>   at times he turned his eyes
sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight
in his favour </s>
<s>  and when the points against him were stated with
terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that
he would even then urge something in his behalf </s>
<s>   beyond these
manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot </s>
<s>   he had
scarcely moved since the trial began </s>
<s>  and now that the judge ceased to
speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close
attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still </s>
<s> 

a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself </s>
<s>   looking round
he saw that the juryman had turned together to consider their verdict </s>
<s> 
as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising
above each other to see his face </s>
<s>   some hastily applying their glasses
to their eyes </s>
<s>   and others whispering their neighbours with looks
expressive of abhorrence </s>
<s>   a few there were who seemed unmindful of
him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could
delay </s>
<s>   but in no one facenot even among the women of whom there
were many therecould he read the faintest sympathy with himself or
any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be
condemned </s>
<s> 

as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness
came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards
the judge </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 

they only sought permission to retire </s>
<s> 

he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed
out as though to see which way the greater number leant </s>
<s>  but that was
fruitless </s>
<s>   the jailer touched him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  he followed
mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair </s>
<s>   the man
pointed it out or he would not have seen it </s>
<s> 

he looked up into the gallery again </s>
<s>   some of the people were eating
and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs </s>
<s>  for the crowded place
was very hot </s>
<s>   there was one young man sketching his face in a little
notebook </s>
<s>   he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the
artist broke his pencilpoint and made another with his knife as any
idle spectator might have done </s>
<s> 

in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind
began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost
and how he put it on </s>
<s>   there was an old fat gentleman on the bench
too who had gone out some half an hour before and now come back </s>
<s>   he
wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner
what he had had and where he had had it </s>
<s>  and pursued this train of
careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused
another </s>
<s> 

not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one
oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet </s>
<s>  it
was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could
not fix his thoughts upon it </s>
<s>   thus even while he trembled and turned
burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron
spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken
off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was </s>
<s>   then he
thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffoldand stopped
to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool itand then went on to
think again </s>
<s> 

at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all
towards the door </s>
<s>   the jury returned and passed him close </s>
<s>  he could
glean nothing from their faces </s>
<s>  they might as well have been of stone </s>
<s> 
perfect stillness ensuednot a rustlenot a breathguilty </s>
<s> 

the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another
and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled
out like angry thunder </s>
<s>   it was a peal of joy from the populace
outside greeting the news that he would die on monday </s>
<s> 

the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him </s>
<s>  he had resumed his
listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the
demand was made </s>
<s>  but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it
and then he only muttered that he was an old manan old manand so
dropping into a whisper was silent again </s>
<s> 

the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the
same air and gesture </s>
<s>   a woman in the gallery uttered some
exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity </s>
<s>  he looked hastily up
as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively </s>
<s> 
the address was solemn and impressive </s>
<s>  the sentence fearful to hear </s>
<s> 
but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve </s>
<s>   his
haggard face was still thrust forward his underjaw hanging down and
his eyes staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his
arm and beckoned him away </s>
<s>   he gazed stupidly about him for an
instant and obeyed </s>
<s> 

they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners
were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their
friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard </s>
<s> 
there was nobody there to speak to him </s>
<s>  but as he passed the
prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were
clinging to the bars </s>
<s>   and they assailed him with opprobrious names
and screeched and hissed </s>
<s>   he shook his fist and would have spat upon
them </s>
<s>  but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage
lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison </s>
<s> 

here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of
anticipating the law </s>
<s>  this ceremony performed they led him to one of
the condemned cells and left him therealone </s>
<s> 

he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat
and bedstead </s>
<s>  and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to
collect his thoughts </s>
<s>  after awhile he began to remember a few
disjointed fragments of what the judge had said </s>
<s>  though it had seemed
to him at the time that he could not hear a word </s>
<s>   these gradually
fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more </s>
<s>   so that
in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered </s>
<s>   to be
hanged by the neck till he was deadthat was the end </s>
<s>   to be hanged

as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known

rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them </s>
<s>   he
had seen some of them dieand had joked too because they died with
prayers upon their lips </s>
<s>   with what a rattling noise the drop went
down </s>

dangling heaps of clothes </s>

been built for many years </s>

at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door

into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall </s>
<s>   the other dragging in
a mattress on which to pass the night </s>

alone no more </s>

then came the nightdark dismal silent night </s>

the day passed off </s>

its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours </s>

raved and blasphemed </s>

venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he

saturday night </s>

of this the day brokesunday </s>
<s> 

it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering
sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon
his blighted soul </s>
<s>  not that he had ever held any defined or positive
hope of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than
the dim probability of dying so soon </s>
<s>  he had spoken little to either of
the two men who relieved each other in their attendance upon him </s>
<s>  and
they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention </s>
<s>   he had
sat there awake but dreaming </s>
<s>   now he started up every minute and
with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even theyused to such
sightsrecoiled from him with horror </s>
<s>   he grew so terrible at last
in all the tortures of his evil conscience that one man could not bear
to sit there eyeing him alone </s>
<s>  and so the two kept watch together </s>
<s> 

he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the past </s>
<s>  he had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth </s>
<s>   his red hair
hung down upon his bloodless face </s>

knots </s>

was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow would have slept but ill that
night if they could have seen him </s>
<s> 

from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two
and three presented themselves at the lodgegate and inquired with
anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received </s>
<s>   these being
answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to
clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from

scene </s>
<s>   by degrees they fell off one by one </s>

dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness </s>
<s> 

the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers
painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd when <abvr> brownlow and oliver appeared
at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner
signed by one of the sheriffs </s>

lodge </s>

it is not indeed my friend rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>

seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as
welleven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him
now </s>
<s> 

these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver </s>
<s> 
the man touched his hat </s>
<s>  and glancing at oliver with some curiousity
opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and
led them on through dark and winding ways towards the cells </s>
<s> 

this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
workmen were making some preparations in profound silencethis is the
place he passes through </s>
<s>   if you step this way you can see the door he
goes out at </s>
<s> 

he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the
prison food and pointed to a door </s>
<s>   there was an open grating above
it through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the
noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards </s>
<s>   they were
putting up the scaffold </s>
<s> 

from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by
other turnkeys from the inner side </s>
<s>  and having entered an open yard
ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row
of strong doors on the left hand </s>
<s>   motioning them to remain where they
were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys </s>
<s>  the
two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage
stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned
the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell </s>
<s>   they did so </s>
<s> 

the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side
to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
face of a man </s>
<s>   his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for
he continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence
otherwise than as a part of his vision </s>

there </s>

him what you want </s>

time gets on </s>

the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned </s>

the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp
held him back </s>

instant </s>

massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard </s>

it was some time before they left the prison </s>

after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an hour or more

and simple words </s>
<s> 

before three months had passed rose fleming and harry maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergymans labours </s>
<s>  on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  maylie took up her abode with her son and daughterinlaw to
enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her days the greatest felicity

those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a
wellspent life have been unceasingly bestowed </s>
<s> 

it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered
either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided
between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than
three thousand pounds </s>
<s>   by the provisions of his fathers will oliver
would have been entitled to the whole </s>
<s>  but <abvr> brownlow unwilling to
deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices
and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to
which his young charge joyfully acceded </s>
<s> 

monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a
distant part of the new world </s>
<s>  where having quickly squandered it he
once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk
under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison </s>
<s>   as far from
home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagins gang </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow adopted oliver as his son </s>
<s>   removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonagehouse where his dear
friends resided he gratified the only remaining wish of olivers warm
and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world </s>
<s> 

soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned
to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would
have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a
feeling </s>
<s>  and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how </s>
<s>   for
two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared
the air began to disagree with him </s>
<s>  then finding that the place really
no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his
assistant took a bachelors cottage outside the village of which his
young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered </s>
<s>   here he took
to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other
pursuits of a similar kind </s>
<s>   all undertaken with his characteristic
impetuosity </s>
<s>   in each and all he has since become famous throughout the
neighborhood as a most profound authority </s>
<s> 

before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for
mr </s>

<s>   he
is accordingly visited by <abvr> grimwig a great many times in the course
of the year </s>
<s>   on all such occasions <abvr> grimwig plants fishes and
carpenters with great ardour </s>
<s>  doing everything in a very singular and
unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite
asseveration that his mode is the right one </s>
<s>   on sundays he never
fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergymans face </s>
<s>   always
informing <abvr> losberne in strict confidence afterwards that he
considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say
so </s>
<s>   it is a standing and very favourite joke for <abvr> brownlow to
rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of
the night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his
return </s>
<s>  but <abvr> grimwig contends that he was right in the main and in
proof thereof remarks that oliver did not come back after all </s>

always calls forth a laugh on his side and increases his good humour </s>

some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened
with too much work </s>
<s>   after some consideration he went into business as
an informer in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence </s>
<s>   his
plan is to walk out once a week during church time attended by
charlotte in respectable attire </s>
<s>   the lady faints away at the doors of
charitable publicans and the gentleman being accommodated with
threepenny worth of brandy to restore her lays an information next
day and pockets half the penalty </s>
<s>   sometimes <abvr> claypole faints
himself but the result is the same </s>

reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in

master charles bates appalled by sikess crime fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best </s>

arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back
upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of

summer group </s>

hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk </s>

would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling
untiring discharge of domestic duties at home </s>

sadly lost </s>

seeds of all he wished him to becomehow he traced in him new traits

melancholy and yet sweet and soothinghow the two orphans tried by
adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love
