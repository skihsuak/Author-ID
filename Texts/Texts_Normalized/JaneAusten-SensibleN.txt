<s> the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex </s>
<s>   their estate
was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of
their property where for many generations they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance </s>
<s>   the late owner of this estate was a single
man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his
life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister </s>
<s>   but her
death which happened ten years before his own produced a great
alteration in his home </s>
<s>  for to supply her loss he invited and received
into his house the family of his nephew <abvr> henry dashwood the legal
inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to
bequeath it </s>
<s>   in the society of his nephew and niece and their
children the old gentlemans days were comfortably spent </s>
<s>   his
attachment to them all increased </s>
<s>   the constant attention of <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from
interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive </s>
<s>  and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his existence </s>
<s> 

by a former marriage <abvr> henry dashwood had one son </s>
<s>  by his present
lady three daughters </s>
<s>   the son a steady respectable young man was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age </s>
<s>   by his own
marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his
wealth </s>
<s>   to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters </s>
<s>  for their fortune independent
of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that
property could be but small </s>
<s>   their mother had nothing and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal </s>
<s>  for the
remaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was also secured to her
child and he had only a lifeinterest in it </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman died </s>
<s>  his will was read and like almost every other
will gave as much disappointment as pleasure </s>
<s>   he was neither so
unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew </s>
<s> but
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his son </s>
<s> but to his son and his
sons son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or
by any sale of its valuable woods </s>
<s>   the whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and
mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old </s>
<s>  an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his
own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which for years he had received
from his niece and her daughters </s>
<s>   he meant not to be unkind however
and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a
thousand pounds apiece </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwoods disappointment was at first severe </s>
<s>  but his temper was
cheerful and sanguine </s>
<s>  and he might reasonably hope to live many years
and by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate
improvement </s>
<s>   but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was
his only one twelvemonth </s>
<s>   he survived his uncle no longer </s>
<s>  and ten
thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for
his widow and daughters </s>
<s> 

his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him <abvr>
dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command the interest of his motherinlaw and sisters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family </s>
<s>  but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable </s>
<s>   his father was rendered easy by such an assurance
and <abvr> john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his power to do for them </s>
<s> 

he was not an illdisposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be illdisposed </s>
<s>  but he was in general well
respected </s>
<s>  for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties </s>
<s>   had he married a more amiable woman he might
have been made still more respectable than he was </s>
<s> he might even have
been made amiable himself </s>
<s>  for he was very young when he married and
very fond of his wife </s>
<s>   but <abvr> john dashwood was a strong caricature
of himself </s>
<s> more narrowminded and selfish </s>
<s> 

when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds apiece </s>
<s>   he then really thought himself equal to it </s>
<s>   the
prospect of four thousand ayear in addition to his present income
besides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune warmed his
heart and made him feel capable of generosity </s>
<s>  yes he would give
them three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  it would be liberal and handsome </s>
<s>  it would
be enough to make them completely easy </s>
<s>   three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  he
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience </s>
<s>  he
thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did
not repent </s>
<s> 

no sooner was his fathers funeral over than <abvr> john dashwood
without sending any notice of her intention to her motherinlaw
arrived with her child and their attendants </s>
<s>   no one could dispute her
right to come </s>
<s>  the house was her husbands from the moment of his
fathers decease </s>
<s>  but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater and to a woman in <abvr> dashwoods situation with only common
feelings must have been highly unpleasing </s>
<s> but in her mind there was
a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of
the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of
immovable disgust </s>
<s>   <abvr> john dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her husbands family </s>
<s>  but she had had no opportunity till the
present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she could act when occasion required it </s>
<s> 

so acutely did <abvr> dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so
earnestly did she despise her daughterinlaw for it that on the
arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children
determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother </s>
<s> 

elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed
a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified
her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and
enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all
that eagerness of mind in <abvr> dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence </s>
<s>   she had an excellent heart </s>
<s> her disposition was
affectionate and her feelings were strong </s>
<s>  but she knew how to govern
them </s>
<s>  it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn </s>
<s>  and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught </s>
<s> 

mariannes abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinors </s>
<s> 
she was sensible and clever </s>
<s>  but eager in everything </s>
<s>  her sorrows her
joys could have no moderation </s>
<s>   she was generous amiable
interesting </s>
<s>  she was everything but prudent </s>
<s>   the resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great </s>
<s> 

elinor saw with concern the excess of her sisters sensibility </s>
<s>  but
by <abvr> dashwood it was valued and cherished </s>
<s>   they encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction </s>
<s>   the agony of grief
which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought
for was created again and again </s>
<s>   they gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future </s>
<s>   elinor too was deeply afflicted </s>
<s>  but still she could
struggle she could exert herself </s>
<s>   she could consult with her brother
could receive her sisterinlaw on her arrival and treat her with
proper attention </s>
<s>  and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance </s>
<s> 

margaret the other sister was a goodhumored welldisposed girl </s>
<s>  but
as she had already imbibed a good deal of mariannes romance without
having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal
her sisters at a more advanced period of life </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland </s>
<s>  and her
mother and sistersinlaw were degraded to the condition of visitors </s>
<s> 
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility </s>
<s>  and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself his wife and their child </s>
<s>   he really pressed them
with some earnestness to consider norland as their home </s>
<s>  and as no
plan appeared so eligible to <abvr> dashwood as remaining there till she
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his
invitation was accepted </s>
<s> 

a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight was exactly what suited her mind </s>
<s>   in seasons of cheerfulness
no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater
degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself </s>
<s>   but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters </s>
<s>   to take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree </s>
<s>   she begged him to think again on the subject </s>
<s>   how
could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too
of so large a sum </s>
<s>   and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods
who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no
relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount </s>
<s>   it
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages </s>
<s>  and why was he
to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his
money to his half sisters </s>
<s> 

it was my fathers last request to me replied her husband that i
should assist his widow and daughters </s>
<s> 

he did not know what he was talking of i dare say </s>
<s>  ten to one but he
was lightheaded at the time </s>
<s>   had he been in his right senses he
could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
your fortune from your own child </s>
<s> 

he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny </s>
<s>  he only
requested me in general terms to assist them and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do </s>
<s>   perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself </s>
<s>   he could
hardly suppose i should neglect them </s>
<s>   but as he required the promise
i could not do less than give it </s>
<s>  at least i thought so at the time </s>
<s> 
the promise therefore was given and must be performed </s>
<s>   something
must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new
home </s>
<s> 

well then let something be done for them </s>
<s>  but that something need
not be three thousand pounds </s>
<s>   consider she added that when the
money is once parted with it never can return </s>
<s>   your sisters will
marry and it will be gone for ever </s>
<s>   if indeed it could be restored
to our poor little boy

why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make
great difference </s>
<s>   the time may come when harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with </s>
<s>   if he should have a numerous family for
instance it would be a very convenient addition </s>
<s> 

to be sure it would </s>
<s> 

perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were
diminished one half </s>
<s> five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  beyond anything great </s>
<s>   what brother on earth would do half so
much for his sisters even if really his sisters </s>
<s>   and as it isonly
half blood </s>
<s> but you have such a generous spirit </s>
<s> 

i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied </s>
<s>   one had rather
on such occasions do too much than too little </s>
<s>   no one at least can
think i have not done enough for them </s>
<s>  even themselves they can hardly
expect more </s>
<s> 

there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are
not to think of their expectations </s>
<s>  the question is what you can
afford to do </s>
<s> 

certainlyand i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds
apiece </s>
<s>   as it is without any addition of mine they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mothers deatha very comfortable
fortune for any young woman </s>
<s> 

to be sure it is </s>
<s>  and indeed it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all </s>
<s>   they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them </s>
<s>   if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do
not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the
whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives rather than for themsomething of the annuity kind i
mean </s>
<s> my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself </s>
<s> 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable </s>
<s> 

his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this
plan </s>
<s> 

to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once </s>
<s>   but then if <abvr> dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in </s>
<s> 

fifteen years </s>
<s>  my dear fanny </s>
<s>  her life cannot be worth half that
purchase </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s>  but if you observe people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them </s>
<s>  and she is very stout and healthy
and hardly forty </s>
<s>   an annuity is a very serious business </s>
<s>  it comes over
and over every year and there is no getting rid of it </s>
<s>   you are not
aware of what you are doing </s>
<s>   i have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities </s>
<s>  for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my fathers will and it is amazing how
disagreeable she found it </s>
<s>   twice every year these annuities were to be
paid </s>
<s>  and then there was the trouble of getting it to them </s>
<s>  and then
one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing </s>
<s>   my mother was quite sick of it </s>
<s>   her income was not her
own she said with such perpetual claims on it </s>
<s>  and it was the more
unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been
entirely at my mothers disposal without any restriction whatever </s>
<s>   it
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world </s>
<s> 

it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied <abvr> dashwood to have
those kind of yearly drains on ones income </s>
<s>   ones fortune as your
mother justly says is not ones own </s>
<s>   to be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable </s>
<s>  it
takes away ones independence </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  and after all you have no thanks for it </s>
<s>   they think
themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises
no gratitude at all </s>
<s>   if i were you whatever i did should be done at
my own discretion entirely </s>
<s>   i would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly </s>
<s>   it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses </s>
<s> 

i believe you are right my love </s>
<s>  it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case </s>
<s>  whatever i may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year </s>
<s>   it will certainly be much the best way </s>
<s>   a present of fifty
pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for
money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father </s>
<s> 

to be sure it will </s>
<s>   indeed to say the truth i am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all </s>
<s>   the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you </s>
<s>  for instance such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things
and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they
are in season </s>
<s>   ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther </s>
<s>  indeed
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did </s>
<s>   do but consider
my dear <abvr> dashwood how excessively comfortable your motherinlaw
and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which
brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they will
pay their mother for their board out of it </s>
<s>   altogether they will have
five hundred ayear amongst them and what on earth can four women want
for more than that </s>
<s> they will live so cheap </s>
<s>  their housekeeping will
be nothing at all </s>
<s>   they will have no carriage no horses and hardly
any servants </s>
<s>  they will keep no company and can have no expenses of
any kind </s>
<s>   only conceive how comfortable they will be </s>
<s>   five hundred a
year </s>
<s>  i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it </s>
<s>  and as
to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it </s>
<s>   they will
be much more able to give you something </s>
<s> 

upon my word said <abvr> dashwood i believe you are perfectly right </s>
<s> 
my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say </s>
<s>   i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described </s>
<s>   when my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can </s>
<s>   some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then </s>
<s> 

certainly returned <abvr> john dashwood </s>
<s>   but however one thing
must be considered </s>
<s>   when your father and mother moved to norland
though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and
linen was saved and is now left to your mother </s>
<s>   her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it </s>
<s> 

that is a material consideration undoubtedly </s>
<s>   a valuable legacy
indeed </s>
<s>  and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house </s>
<s>   a great deal too handsome in my opinion for
any place they can ever afford to live in </s>
<s>   but however so it is </s>
<s> 
your father thought only of them </s>
<s>   and i must say this </s>
<s>  that you owe no
particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes </s>
<s>  for we very
well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the
world to them </s>
<s> 

this argument was irresistible </s>
<s>   it gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before </s>
<s>  and he finally resolved that it would be
absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the
widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his own wife pointed out </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood remained at norland several months </s>
<s>  not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while </s>
<s>  for when
her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland </s>
<s>  for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible </s>
<s>   but she could
hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which
her mother would have approved </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections </s>
<s>   she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her
daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than l would support her in
affluence </s>
<s>   for their brothers sake too for the sake of his own
heart she rejoiced </s>
<s>  and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
merit before in believing him incapable of generosity </s>
<s>   his attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
was dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on the
liberality of his intentions </s>
<s> 

the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for
her daughterinlaw was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character which half a years residence in her family afforded </s>
<s> 
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to
the opinions of <abvr> dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland </s>
<s> 

this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of <abvr> john dashwood a gentlemanlike and pleasing young
man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters
establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there </s>
<s> 

some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich </s>
<s>  and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence
for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother </s>
<s>   but <abvr> dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration </s>
<s>   it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable
that he loved her daughter and that elinor returned the partiality </s>
<s> 
it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition </s>
<s>  and that elinors merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible </s>
<s> 

edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address </s>
<s>   he was not handsome and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing </s>
<s>   he was too diffident
to do justice to himself </s>
<s>  but when his natural shyness was overcome
his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart </s>
<s> 
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid
improvement </s>
<s>   but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him
distinguishedasthey hardly knew what </s>
<s>   they wanted him to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other </s>
<s>   his mother wished to
interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day </s>
<s>   <abvr> john
dashwood wished it likewise </s>
<s>  but in the mean while till one of these
superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche </s>
<s>   but edward had no turn for
great men or barouches </s>
<s>   all his wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life </s>
<s>   fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising </s>
<s> 

edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of <abvr> dashwoods attention </s>
<s>  for she was at that time in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects </s>
<s>   she saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it </s>
<s>   he
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by illtimed conversation </s>
<s> 
she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a
reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him and his sister </s>
<s>   it was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother </s>
<s> 

it is enough said she </s>
<s>  to say that he is unlike fanny is enough </s>
<s> 
it implies everything amiable </s>
<s>   i love him already </s>
<s> 

i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him </s>
<s> 

like him </s>
<s>  replied her mother with a smile </s>
<s>   i feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love </s>
<s> 

you may esteem him </s>
<s> 

i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him </s>
<s>   her manners
were attaching and soon banished his reserve </s>
<s>   she speedily
comprehended all his merits </s>
<s>  the persuasion of his regard for elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration </s>
<s>  but she really felt assured of his
worth </s>
<s>  and even that quietness of manner which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young mans address ought to be was no
longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
affectionate </s>
<s> 

no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
elinor than she considered their serious attachment as certain and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching </s>
<s> 

in a few months my dear marianne </s>
<s>  said she elinor will in all
probability be settled for life </s>
<s>   we shall miss her </s>

happy </s>

perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise </s>

striking </s>

<s>   his eyes want all that spirit
that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence </s>
<s>   and besides
all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste </s>
<s>   music seems
scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinors drawings very
much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth </s>
<s>   it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while
she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter </s>
<s>   he admires as
a lover not as a connoisseur </s>
<s>   to satisfy me those characters must be
united </s>
<s>   i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own </s>
<s>   he must enter into all my feelings </s>

<s>  mama how
spiritless how tame was edwards manner in reading to us last night </s>
<s> 
i felt for my sister most severely </s>
<s>   yet she bore it with so much
composure she seemed scarcely to notice it </s>
<s>   i could hardly keep my
seat </s>
<s>   to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such
dreadful indifference </s>
<s> 

he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose </s>
<s> 
i thought so at the time </s>
<s>  but you would give him cowper </s>
<s> 

nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper </s>
<s> but we must allow
for difference of taste </s>
<s>   elinor has not my feelings and therefore she
may overlook it and be happy with him </s>
<s>   but it would have broke my
heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility </s>
<s> 
mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i

chapter 


what a pity it is elinor said marianne that edward should have no
taste for drawing </s>
<s> 

no taste for drawing </s>
<s>  replied elinor why should you think so </s>
<s>  he
does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of
improving it </s>
<s>   had he ever been in the way of learning i think he
would have drawn very well </s>
<s>   he distrusts his own judgment in such
matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any
picture </s>
<s>  but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which
in general direct him perfectly right </s>
<s> 

marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject </s>
<s>  but
the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the
drawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delight
which in her opinion could alone be called taste </s>
<s>   yet though
smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for that
blind partiality to edward which produced it </s>
<s> 

i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him as
deficient in general taste </s>
<s>   indeed i think i may say that you cannot
for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your
opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him </s>
<s> 

marianne hardly knew what to say </s>
<s>   she would not wound the feelings of
her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was
impossible </s>
<s>   at length she replied </s>
<s> 

do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his merits </s>
<s>   i have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his
inclinations and tastes as you have </s>
<s>  but i have the highest opinion in
the world of his goodness and sense </s>
<s>   i think him every thing that is
worthy and amiable </s>
<s> 

i am sure replied elinor with a smile that his dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that </s>
<s>   i do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly </s>
<s> 

marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased </s>
<s> 

of his sense and his goodness continued elinor no one can i
think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in
unreserved conversation </s>
<s>   the excellence of his understanding and his
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him silent </s>
<s>   you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth </s>
<s> 
but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself </s>
<s>   he and i
have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother </s>
<s>   i
have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard
his opinion on subjects of literature and taste </s>
<s>  and upon the whole i
venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed enjoyment of books
exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and
correct and his taste delicate and pure </s>
<s>   his abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person </s>
<s> 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking </s>
<s>  and his person
can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which
are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is
perceived </s>
<s>   at present i know him so well that i think him really
handsome </s>
<s>  or at least almost so </s>
<s>   what say you marianne </s>
<s> 

i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now </s>
<s>   when
you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection
in his face than i now do in his heart </s>
<s> 

elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she
had been betrayed into in speaking of him </s>
<s>   she felt that edward stood
very high in her opinion </s>
<s>   she believed the regard to be mutual </s>
<s>  but
she required greater certainty of it to make mariannes conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her </s>
<s>   she knew that what marianne and her
mother conjectured one moment they believed the nextthat with them
to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect </s>
<s>   she tried to explain
the real state of the case to her sister </s>
<s> 

i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of
himthat i greatly esteem that i like him </s>
<s> 

marianne here burst forth with indignation

esteem him </s>
<s>  like him </s>
<s>  coldhearted elinor </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>   worse than
coldhearted </s>
<s>  ashamed of being otherwise </s>
<s>   use those words again and i
will leave the room this moment </s>
<s> 

elinor could not help laughing </s>
<s>   excuse me said she </s>
<s>  and be assured
that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my
own feelings </s>
<s>   believe them to be stronger than i have declared </s>
<s> 
believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicionthe
hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly </s>
<s> 
but farther than this you must not believe </s>
<s>   i am by no means assured
of his regard for me </s>
<s>   there are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful </s>
<s>  and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by
believing or calling it more than it is </s>
<s>   in my heart i feel
littlescarcely any doubt of his preference </s>
<s>   but there are other
points to be considered besides his inclination </s>
<s>   he is very far from
being independent </s>
<s>   what his mother really is we cannot know </s>
<s>  but from
fannys occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never
been disposed to think her amiable </s>
<s>  and i am very much mistaken if
edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank </s>
<s> 

marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
and herself had outstripped the truth </s>
<s> 

and you really are not engaged to him </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>   yet it certainly
soon will happen </s>
<s>   but two advantages will proceed from this delay </s>
<s>   i
shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  if he should
be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how
delightful it would be </s>
<s> 

elinor had given her real opinion to her sister </s>
<s>   she could not
consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne
had believed it </s>
<s>   there was at times a want of spirits about him
which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as
unpromising </s>
<s>   a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not
give him more than inquietude </s>
<s>   it would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him </s>
<s>   a more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his affection </s>
<s>   she knew that his mother neither behaved
to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him
any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly
attending to her views for his aggrandizement </s>
<s>   with such a knowledge
as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject </s>
<s>   she
was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which
her mother and sister still considered as certain </s>
<s>   nay the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard </s>
<s> 
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more
than friendship </s>
<s> 

but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived
by his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which was
still more common to make her uncivil </s>
<s>   she took the first
opportunity of affronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking to
her so expressively of her brothers great expectations of <abvr>
ferrarss resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in </s>
<s>  that
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to
be calm </s>
<s>   she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and
instantly left the room resolving that whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations </s>
<s> 

in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from the
post which contained a proposal particularly well timed </s>
<s>   it was the
offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of
her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire </s>
<s>   the
letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation </s>
<s>   he understood that she was in need of a
dwelling </s>
<s>  and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage
he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might
think necessary if the situation pleased her </s>
<s>   he earnestly pressed
her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with
her daughters to barton park the place of his own residence from
whence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses
were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable
to her </s>
<s>   he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his cousin </s>
<s>  more especially at a moment when she was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer
connections </s>
<s>   she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry </s>
<s>   her
resolution was formed as she read </s>
<s>   the situation of barton in a
county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours
before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first
recommendation </s>
<s>   to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an
evil </s>
<s>  it was an object of desire </s>
<s>  it was a blessing in comparison of
the misery of continuing her daughterinlaws guest </s>
<s>  and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress </s>
<s>   she instantly wrote sir
john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance
of his proposal </s>
<s>  and then hastened to shew both letters to her
daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her
answer were sent </s>
<s> 

elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance </s>
<s>   on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose
her mothers intention of removing into devonshire </s>
<s>   the house too as
described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so
uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either
point </s>
<s>  and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland
beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence </s>
<s> 



chapter 


no sooner was her answer dispatched than <abvr> dashwood indulged herself
in the pleasure of announcing to her soninlaw and his wife that she
was provided with a house and should incommode them no longer than till
every thing were ready for her inhabiting it </s>
<s>  they heard her with
surprise </s>
<s>  <abvr> john dashwood said nothing </s>
<s>  but her husband civilly hoped
that she would not be settled far from norland </s>
<s>  she had great
satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire </s>
<s> edward
turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise
and concern which required no explanation to her repeated
devonshire </s>
<s>  are you indeed going there </s>
<s>  so far from hence </s>
<s>  and to
what part of it </s>
<s>  she explained the situation </s>
<s>  it was within four miles
northward of exeter </s>
<s> 

it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my
friends in it </s>
<s>   a room or two can easily be added </s>
<s>  and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will
find none in accommodating them </s>
<s> 

she concluded with a very kind invitation to <abvr> and <abvr> john dashwood
to visit her at barton </s>
<s>  and to edward she gave one with still greater
affection </s>
<s>   though her late conversation with her daughterinlaw had
made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was
unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that
point to which it principally tended </s>
<s>   to separate edward and elinor
was as far from being her object as ever </s>
<s>  and she wished to show <abvr>
john dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally
she disregarded her disapprobation of the match </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to
prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture </s>
<s>   he
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion </s>
<s>  for the very
exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable </s>
<s>  the furniture
was all sent around by water </s>
<s>   it chiefly consisted of household linen
plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of mariannes </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh </s>
<s>  she could not
help feeling it hard that as <abvr> dashwoods income would be so
trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome
article of furniture </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  it was ready furnished
and she might have immediate possession </s>
<s>   no difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement </s>
<s>  and she waited only for the disposal of her
effects at norland and to determine her future household before she
set off for the west </s>
<s>  and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her was soon done </s>
<s> the
horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his
death and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage
she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest
daughter </s>
<s>   for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her
own wishes she would have kept it </s>
<s>  but the discretion of elinor
prevailed </s>
<s>   her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three </s>
<s>  two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland </s>
<s> 

the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire
to prepare the house for their mistresss arrival </s>
<s>  for as lady
middleton was entirely unknown to <abvr> dashwood she preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park </s>
<s>  and she
relied so undoubtingly on sir johns description of the house as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own </s>
<s> 
her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her
removal </s>
<s>  a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure </s>
<s>   now was the
time when her soninlaws promise to his father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled </s>
<s>   since he had neglected to do it on first
coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as
the most suitable period for its accomplishment </s>
<s>   but <abvr> dashwood
began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced
from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended
no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland </s>
<s>   he so
frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of
the perpetual demands upon his purse which a man of any consequence in
the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to
stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
money away </s>
<s> 

in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middletons
first letter to norland every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable <abvr> dashwood and her daughters to begin their
journey </s>
<s> 

many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved </s>
<s>   dear dear norland </s>
<s>  said marianne as she wandered
alone before the house on the last evening of their being there </s>
<s>  when
shall i cease to regret you </s>

<s> oh </s>
<s> 
happy house could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this
spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more </s>
<s> and you ye
wellknown trees </s>
<s> but you will continue the same </s>
<s> no leaf will decay

can observe you no longer </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  you will continue the same </s>
<s>  unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shade </s>

enjoy you </s>

chapter 


the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant </s>
<s>   but as they
drew towards the end of it their interest in the appearance of a
country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view
of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness </s>
<s>   it was a
pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich in pasture </s>
<s>   after winding
along it for more than a mile they reached their own house </s>
<s>   a small
green court was the whole of its demesne in front </s>
<s>  and a neat wicket
gate admitted them into it </s>
<s> 

as a house barton cottage though small was comfortable and compact </s>
<s> 
but as a cottage it was defective for the building was regular the
roof was tiled the window shutters were not painted green nor were
the walls covered with honeysuckles </s>
<s>   a narrow passage led directly
through the house into the garden behind </s>
<s>   on each side of the entrance
was a sitting room about sixteen feet square </s>
<s>  and beyond them were the
offices and the stairs </s>
<s>   four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest
of the house </s>
<s>   it had not been built many years and was in good repair </s>
<s> 
in comparison of norland it was poor and small indeed </s>
<s> but the tears
which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon
dried away </s>
<s>   they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their
arrival and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy </s>
<s> 
it was very early in september </s>
<s>  the season was fine and from first
seeing the place under the advantage of good weather they received an
impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending
it to their lasting approbation </s>
<s> 

the situation of the house was good </s>
<s>   high hills rose immediately
behind and at no great distance on each side </s>
<s>  some of which were open
downs the others cultivated and woody </s>
<s>   the village of barton was
chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the
cottage windows </s>
<s>   the prospect in front was more extensive </s>
<s>  it
commanded the whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond </s>
<s> 
the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that
direction </s>
<s>  under another name and in another course it branched out
again between two of the steepest of them </s>
<s> 

with the size and furniture of the house <abvr> dashwood was upon the
whole well satisfied </s>
<s>  for though her former style of life rendered many
additions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was a
delight to her </s>
<s>  and she had at this time ready money enough to supply
all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments </s>
<s>   as for the
house itself to be sure said she it is too small for our family
but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it
is too late in the year for improvements </s>
<s>   perhaps in the spring if i
have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about
building </s>
<s>   these parlors are both too small for such parties of our
friends as i hope to see often collected here </s>
<s>  and i have some thoughts
of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the
other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance </s>
<s>  this
with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bedchamber
and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage </s>
<s>   i could
wish the stairs were handsome </s>
<s>   but one must not expect every thing </s>
<s> 
though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them </s>
<s>   i
shall see how much i am beforehand with the world in the spring and
we will plan our improvements accordingly </s>
<s> 

in the mean time till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred ayear by a woman who never saved
in her life they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
was </s>
<s>  and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns
and endeavoring by placing around them books and other possessions to
form themselves a home </s>
<s>   mariannes pianoforte was unpacked and
properly disposed of </s>
<s>  and elinors drawings were affixed to the walls
of their sitting room </s>
<s> 

in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast
the next day by the entrance of their landlord who called to welcome
them to barton and to offer them every accommodation from his own
house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient </s>
<s>   sir
john middleton was a good looking man about forty </s>
<s>   he had formerly
visited at stanhill but it was too long for his young cousins to
remember him </s>
<s>   his countenance was thoroughly goodhumoured </s>
<s>  and his
manners were as friendly as the style of his letter </s>
<s>   their arrival
seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an
object of real solicitude to him </s>
<s>   he said much of his earnest desire
of their living in the most sociable terms with his family and pressed
them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were
better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a
point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence </s>
<s> 
his kindness was not confined to words </s>
<s>  for within an hour after he
left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from
the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of
game </s>
<s>   he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and
from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of
sending them his newspaper every day </s>
<s> 

lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him denoting her
intention of waiting on <abvr> dashwood as soon as she could be assured
that her visit would be no inconvenience </s>
<s>  and as this message was
answered by an invitation equally polite her ladyship was introduced
to them the next day </s>
<s> 

they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
their comfort at barton must depend </s>
<s>  and the elegance of her appearance
was favourable to their wishes </s>
<s>   lady middleton was not more than six
or seven and twenty </s>
<s>  her face was handsome her figure tall and
striking and her address graceful </s>
<s>   her manners had all the elegance
which her husbands wanted </s>
<s>   but they would have been improved by some
share of his frankness and warmth </s>
<s>  and her visit was long enough to
detract something from their first admiration by shewing that though
perfectly wellbred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say for
herself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark </s>
<s> 

conversation however was not wanted for sir john was very chatty and
lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their
eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means
there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of
extremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beauty
and ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hung
about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her
ladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could
make noise enough at home </s>
<s>   on every formal visit a child ought to be
of the party by way of provision for discourse </s>
<s>   in the present case
it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his
father or mother and in what particular he resembled either for of
course every body differed and every body was astonished at the
opinion of the others </s>
<s> 

an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the
rest of the children as sir john would not leave the house without
securing their promise of dining at the park the next day </s>
<s> 



chapter 


barton park was about half a mile from the cottage </s>
<s>   the ladies had
passed near it in their way along the valley but it was screened from
their view at home by the projection of a hill </s>

and handsome </s>
<s>  and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance </s>
<s>   the former was for sir johns gratification the latter
for that of his lady </s>
<s>   they were scarcely ever without some friends
staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every
kind than any other family in the neighbourhood </s>
<s>   it was necessary to
the happiness of both </s>
<s>  for however dissimilar in temper and outward
behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
talent and taste which confined their employments unconnected with
such as society produced within a very narrow compass </s>
<s>   sir john was a
sportsman lady middleton a mother </s>
<s>   he hunted and shot and she
humoured her children </s>
<s>  and these were their only resources </s>
<s>   lady
middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the
year round while sir johns independent employments were in existence
only half the time </s>
<s>   continual engagements at home and abroad however
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education </s>
<s>  supported the
good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his
wife </s>
<s> 

lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of
all her domestic arrangements </s>
<s>  and from this kind of vanity was her
greatest enjoyment in any of their parties </s>
<s>   but sir johns
satisfaction in society was much more real </s>
<s>  he delighted in collecting
about him more young people than his house would hold and the noisier
they were the better was he pleased </s>
<s>   he was a blessing to all the
juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever
forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter
his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen </s>
<s> 

the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants
he had now procured for his cottage at barton </s>
<s>   the miss dashwoods were
young pretty and unaffected </s>
<s>   it was enough to secure his good
opinion </s>
<s>  for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
make her mind as captivating as her person </s>
<s>   the friendliness of his
disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation
might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate </s>
<s>   in
showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
of a good heart </s>
<s>  and in settling a family of females only in his
cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman </s>

not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
residence within his own manor </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by
sir john who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity </s>

and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day
before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them </s>

would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself </s>
<s>  a
particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very
young nor very gay </s>

had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some
addition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was full
of engagements </s>
<s>   luckily lady middletons mother had arrived at barton
within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman
he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might
imagine </s>
<s>   the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly
satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for
no more </s>

fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and
rather vulgar </s>
<s>   she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands </s>
<s>  hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex

vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned her eyes towards elinor

resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to be
his wife or <abvr> jennings to be lady middletons mother </s>
<s>   he was
silent and grave </s>
<s>   his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite
of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old
bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty </s>
<s>  but though
his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his
address was particularly gentlemanlike </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
companions to the dashwoods </s>
<s>  but the cold insipidity of lady middleton
was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of
colonel brandon and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his
motherinlaw was interesting </s>
<s>   lady middleton seemed to be roused to
enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner
who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of
discourse except what related to themselves </s>
<s> 

in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she was
invited to play </s>
<s>   the instrument was unlocked every body prepared to
be charmed and marianne who sang very well at their request went
through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since in
the same position on the pianoforte for her ladyship had celebrated
that event by giving up music although by her mothers account she
had played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it </s>
<s> 

mariannes performance was highly applauded </s>
<s>   sir john was loud in his
admiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversation
with the others while every song lasted </s>
<s>   lady middleton frequently
called him to order wondered how any ones attention could be diverted
from music for a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song
which marianne had just finished </s>
<s>   colonel brandon alone of all the
party heard her without being in raptures </s>
<s>   he paid her only the
compliment of attention </s>
<s>  and she felt a respect for him on the
occasion which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
want of taste </s>
<s>   his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was
estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the
others </s>
<s>  and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and
thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
exquisite power of enjoyment </s>
<s>   she was perfectly disposed to make every
allowance for the colonels advanced state of life which humanity
required </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was a widow with an ample jointure </s>
<s>   she had only two
daughters both of whom she had lived to see respectably married and
she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world </s>
<s>   in the promotion of this object she was zealously active as
far as her ability reached </s>
<s>  and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance </s>
<s>   she was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
insinuations of her power over such a young man </s>
<s>  and this kind of
discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to
pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne
dashwood </s>
<s>   she rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening
of their being together from his listening so attentively while she
sang to them </s>
<s>  and when the visit was returned by the middletons dining
at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again </s>
<s> 
it must be so </s>
<s>   she was perfectly convinced of it </s>
<s>   it would be an
excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since her
connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge </s>
<s>  and she
was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl </s>
<s> 

the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable for
it supplied her with endless jokes against them both </s>
<s>   at the park she
laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at marianne </s>
<s>   to the former
her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself
perfectly indifferent </s>
<s>  but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible </s>
<s>  and when its object was understood she hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence
for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonels
advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood who could not think a man five years younger than
herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of
her daughter ventured to clear <abvr> jennings from the probability of
wishing to throw ridicule on his age </s>
<s> 

but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation
though you may not think it intentionally illnatured </s>
<s>   colonel brandon
is certainly younger than <abvr> jennings but he is old enough to be my
father </s>
<s>  and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have
long outlived every sensation of the kind </s>
<s>   it is too ridiculous </s>
<s>   when
is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not
protect him </s>
<s> 

infirmity </s>
<s>  said elinor do you call colonel brandon infirm </s>
<s>   i can
easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother </s>
<s>  but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of
his limbs </s>
<s> 

did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism </s>
<s>   and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life </s>
<s> 

my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must
be in continual terror of my decay </s>
<s>  and it must seem to you a miracle
that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty </s>
<s> 

mama you are not doing me justice </s>
<s>   i know very well that colonel
brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of
losing him in the course of nature </s>
<s>   he may live twenty years longer </s>
<s> 
but thirtyfive has nothing to do with matrimony </s>
<s> 

perhaps said elinor thirtyfive and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together </s>
<s>   but if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should
not think colonel brandons being thirtyfive any objection to his
marrying her </s>
<s> 

a woman of seven and twenty said marianne after pausing a moment
can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be
uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring
herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife </s>
<s>   in his marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable </s>
<s>   it would be a compact of
convenience and the world would be satisfied </s>
<s>   in my eyes it would be
no marriage at all but that would be nothing </s>
<s>   to me it would seem
only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the
expense of the other </s>
<s> 

it would be impossible i know replied elinor to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirtyfive
anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her </s>
<s> 
but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to
complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his shoulders </s>
<s> 

but he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne </s>
<s>  and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps
rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble </s>
<s> 

had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him
half so much </s>
<s>   confess marianne is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever </s>
<s> 

soon after this upon elinors leaving the room mama said
marianne i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot
conceal from you </s>
<s>   i am sure edward ferrars is not well </s>
<s>   we have now
been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come </s>
<s>   nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay </s>
<s>   what else
can detain him at norland </s>
<s> 

had you any idea of his coming so soon </s>
<s>  said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   i had
none </s>
<s>   on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his
coming to barton </s>
<s>   does elinor expect him already </s>
<s> 

i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must </s>
<s> 

i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed
that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the
room would be wanted for some time </s>
<s> 

how strange this is </s>
<s>  what can be the meaning of it </s>
<s>   but the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable </s>
<s>  how cold how
composed were their last adieus </s>
<s>  how languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together </s>
<s>  in edwards farewell there was no
distinction between elinor and me </s>
<s>  it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both </s>
<s>   twice did i leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most
unaccountably follow me out of the room </s>
<s>   and elinor in quitting
norland and edward cried not as i did </s>
<s>   even now her selfcommand is
invariable </s>
<s>   when is she dejected or melancholy </s>

avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it </s>

chapter 


the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves </s>
<s>   the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding
them were now become familiar and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the loss of their
father </s>
<s>   sir john middleton who called on them every day for the first
fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
home could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed </s>
<s> 

their visitors except those from barton park were not many </s>
<s>  for in
spite of sir johns urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at
their service the independence of <abvr> dashwoods spirit overcame the
wish of society for her children </s>
<s>  and she was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk </s>
<s>   there were but few who
could be so classed </s>
<s>  and it was not all of them that were attainable </s>
<s> 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding
valley of allenham which issued from that of barton as formerly
described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an
ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little
of norland interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it </s>
<s>   but they learnt on enquiry that its
possessor an elderly lady of very good character was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world and never stirred from home </s>
<s> 

the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks </s>
<s>   the high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
beauties </s>
<s>  and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one
memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine
of a showery sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned </s>
<s>   the weather was
not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
book in spite of mariannes declaration that the day would be
lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
from their hills </s>
<s>  and the two girls set off together </s>
<s> 

they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky </s>
<s>  and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high southwesterly wind they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations </s>
<s> 

is there a felicity in the world said marianne superior to
this </s>
<s> margaret we will walk here at least two hours </s>
<s> 

margaret agreed and they pursued their way against the wind resisting
it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly
the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in
their face </s>
<s>  chagrined and surprised they were obliged though
unwillingly to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own
house </s>
<s>   one consolation however remained for them to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety </s>
<s>  it was that of
running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
led immediately to their garden gate </s>
<s> 

they set off </s>
<s>   marianne had at first the advantage but a false step
brought her suddenly to the ground </s>
<s>  and margaret unable to stop
herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the
bottom in safety </s>
<s> 

a gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers playing round him was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne when her
accident happened </s>
<s>   he put down his gun and ran to her assistance </s>
<s>   she
had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in
her fall and she was scarcely able to stand </s>
<s>   the gentleman offered
his services </s>
<s>  and perceiving that her modesty declined what her
situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther
delay and carried her down the hill </s>
<s>   then passing through the garden
the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly
into the house whither margaret was just arrived and quitted not his
hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour </s>
<s> 

elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for
his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received
additional charms from his voice and expression </s>
<s>   had he been even old
ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of <abvr> dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her child </s>
<s>  but the
influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the
action which came home to her feelings </s>
<s> 

she thanked him again and again </s>
<s>  and with a sweetness of address which
always attended her invited him to be seated </s>
<s>   but this he declined
as he was dirty and wet </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood then begged to know to whom she
was obliged </s>
<s>   his name he replied was willoughby and his present
home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would allow him the
honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood </s>
<s>   the honour
was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more
interesting in the midst of a heavy rain </s>
<s> 

his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry raised
against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior
attractions </s>
<s>  marianne herself had seen less of his mama the
rest for the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his lifting
her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their
entering the house </s>
<s>   but she had seen enough of him to join in all the
admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her
praise </s>
<s>   his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story </s>
<s>  and in his carrying her into the
house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of
thought which particularly recommended the action to her </s>
<s>   every
circumstance belonging to him was interesting </s>
<s>   his name was good his
residence was in their favourite village and she soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shootingjacket was the most becoming </s>
<s>   her
imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded </s>
<s> 

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him to get out of doors </s>
<s>  and mariannes accident
being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any
gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham </s>
<s> 

willoughby </s>
<s>  cried sir john </s>
<s>  what is he in the country </s>
<s>  that is good
news however </s>
<s>  i will ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on
thursday </s>
<s> 

you know him then said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s> 

know him </s>
<s>  to be sure i do </s>
<s>   why he is down here every year </s>
<s> 

and what sort of a young man is he </s>
<s> 

as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you </s>
<s>   a very decent
shot and there is not a bolder rider in england </s>
<s> 

and is that all you can say for him </s>
<s>  cried marianne indignantly </s>
<s> 
but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance </s>
<s>  what his
pursuits his talents and genius </s>
<s> 

sir john was rather puzzled </s>
<s> 

upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that </s>
<s> 
but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest
little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw </s>
<s>   was she out with him
today </s>
<s> 

but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of <abvr>
willoughbys pointer than he could describe to her the shades of his
mind </s>
<s> 

but who is he </s>
<s>  said elinor </s>
<s>   where does he come from </s>
<s>   has he a
house at allenham </s>
<s> 

on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence </s>
<s>  and he
told them that <abvr> willoughby had no property of his own in the
country </s>
<s>  that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady
at allenham court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was
to inherit </s>
<s>  adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can
tell you miss dashwood </s>
<s>  he has a pretty little estate of his own in
somersetshire besides </s>
<s>  and if i were you i would not give him up to my
younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills </s>
<s>   miss
marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself </s>
<s>   brandon will
be jealous if she does not take care </s>
<s> 

i do not believe said <abvr> dashwood with a good humoured smile
that <abvr> willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my
daughters towards what you call catching him </s>
<s>   it is not an employment
to which they have been brought up </s>
<s>   men are very safe with us let
them be ever so rich </s>
<s>   i am glad to find however from what you say
that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not
be ineligible </s>
<s> 

he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated
sir john </s>
<s>   i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he
danced from eight oclock till four without once sitting down </s>
<s> 

did he indeed </s>
<s>  cried marianne with sparkling eyes and with
elegance with spirit </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and he was up again at eight to ride to covert </s>
<s> 

that is what i like </s>
<s>  that is what a young man ought to be </s>
<s>   whatever
be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and
leave him no sense of fatigue </s>
<s> 

aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be </s>
<s> 
you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor
brandon </s>
<s> 

that is an expression sir john said marianne warmly which i
particularly dislike </s>
<s>   i abhor every commonplace phrase by which wit
is intended </s>
<s>  and setting ones cap at a man or making a conquest
are the most odious of all </s>
<s>   their tendency is gross and illiberal </s>
<s>  and
if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity </s>
<s> 

sir john did not much understand this reproof </s>
<s>  but he laughed as
heartily as if he did and then replied

ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other </s>
<s> 
poor brandon </s>
<s>  he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth
setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling
about and spraining of ankles </s>

chapter 


mariannes preserver as margaret with more elegance than precision
styled willoughby called at the cottage early the next morning to make
his personal enquiries </s>
<s>   he was received by <abvr> dashwood with more
than politeness </s>
<s>  with a kindness which sir johns account of him and
her own gratitude prompted </s>
<s>  and every thing that passed during the
visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance mutual affection
and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
him </s>
<s>   of their personal charms he had not required a second interview
to be convinced </s>
<s> 

miss dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a
remarkably pretty figure </s>
<s>   marianne was still handsomer </s>
<s>   her form
though not so correct as her sisters in having the advantage of
height was more striking </s>
<s>  and her face was so lovely that when in the
common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less
violently outraged than usually happens </s>
<s>   her skin was very brown but
from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant </s>
<s>  her
features were all good </s>
<s>  her smile was sweet and attractive </s>
<s>  and in her
eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness
which could hardily be seen without delight </s>
<s>   from willoughby their
expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the
remembrance of his assistance created </s>
<s>   but when this passed away when
her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect
goodbreeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and
above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was
passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured
the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay </s>
<s> 

it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her
to talk </s>
<s>   she could not be silent when such points were introduced and
she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion </s>
<s>   they speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
to either </s>
<s>   encouraged by this to a further examination of his
opinions she proceeded to question him on the subject of books </s>
<s>  her
favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous
a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been
insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
of such works however disregarded before </s>
<s>   their taste was strikingly
alike </s>
<s>   the same books the same passages were idolized by eachor if
any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than
till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be
displayed </s>
<s>   he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her
enthusiasm </s>
<s>  and long before his visit concluded they conversed with
the familiarity of a longestablished acquaintance </s>
<s> 

well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them for one
morning i think you have done pretty well </s>
<s>   you have already
ascertained <abvr> willoughbys opinion in almost every matter of
importance </s>
<s>   you know what he thinks of cowper and scott </s>
<s>  you are
certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have
received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper </s>
<s> 
but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse </s>
<s>   you will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic </s>
<s>   another meeting will suffice to
explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and
then you can have nothing farther to ask </s>
<s> 

elinor cried marianne is this fair </s>
<s>  is this just </s>
<s>  are my ideas so
scanty </s>
<s>   but i see what you mean </s>
<s>   i have been too much at my ease too
happy too frank </s>
<s>   i have erred against every commonplace notion of
decorum </s>
<s>  i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been
reserved spiritless dull and deceitfulhad i talked only of the
weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this
reproach would have been spared </s>
<s> 

my love said her mother you must not be offended with elinorshe
was only in jest </s>
<s>   i should scold her myself if she were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend </s>
<s>  marianne was softened in a moment </s>
<s> 

willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their
acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer </s>
<s>   he
came to them every day </s>
<s>   to enquire after marianne was at first his
excuse </s>
<s>  but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave
greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
to be possible by mariannes perfect recovery </s>
<s>   she was confined for
some days to the house </s>
<s>  but never had any confinement been less
irksome </s>
<s>   willoughby was a young man of good abilities quick
imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners </s>
<s>   he was
exactly formed to engage mariannes heart for with all this he joined
not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was
now roused and increased by the example of her own and which
recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else </s>
<s> 

his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment </s>
<s>   they read
they talked they sang together </s>
<s>  his musical talents were considerable </s>
<s> 
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had
unfortunately wanted </s>
<s> 

in <abvr> dashwoods estimation he was as faultless as in mariannes </s>
<s>  and
elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too
much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or
circumstances </s>
<s>   in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other
people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinor
could not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in
its support </s>
<s> 

marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her
ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable </s>
<s>   willoughby was
all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period as capable of attaching her </s>
<s>  and his behaviour
declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities
were strong </s>
<s> 

her mother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the
end of a week to hope and expect it </s>
<s>  and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sonsinlaw as edward and willoughby </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons partiality for marianne which had so early been
discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to elinor when
it ceased to be noticed by them </s>
<s>   their attention and wit were drawn
off to his more fortunate rival </s>
<s>  and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility </s>
<s> 
elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments
which <abvr> jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now
actually excited by her sister </s>
<s>  and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of <abvr>
willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon </s>
<s>   she saw it with concern </s>
<s> 
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty </s>
<s>  and as she could not even wish him
successful she heartily wished him indifferent </s>
<s>   she liked himin
spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of
interest </s>
<s>   his manners though serious were mild </s>
<s>  and his reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
natural gloominess of temper </s>
<s>   sir john had dropped hints of past
injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being
an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion </s>
<s> 

perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by
willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither
lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits </s>
<s> 

brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when they
were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and
nobody cares about </s>
<s>  whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers
to talk to </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne </s>
<s> 

do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice in
both of you </s>
<s>   he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and
i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him </s>
<s> 

that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly in
his favour </s>
<s>  but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in
itself </s>
<s>   who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as lady middleton and <abvr> jennings that could command the
indifference of any body else </s>

make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother </s>

praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more

in defence of your protege you can even be saucy </s>

my protege as you call him is a sensible man </s>

have attractions for me </s>
<s>   yes marianne even in a man between thirty
and forty </s>
<s>   he has seen a great deal of the world </s>
<s>  has been abroad has
read and has a thinking mind </s>
<s>   i have found him capable of giving me
much information on various subjects </s>

inquiries with readiness of goodbreeding and good nature </s>
<s> 

that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that
in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are
troublesome </s>
<s> 

he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries

perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins </s>

i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further

i do not dislike him </s>

respectable man who has every bodys good word and nobodys notice </s>

who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to
employ and two new coats every year </s>

add to which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor
spirit </s>
<s>   that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no
ardour and his voice no expression </s>
<s> 

you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied elinor
and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the
commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and
insipid </s>

chapter 


little had <abvr> dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came
into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such
frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment </s>
<s>   yet such was the case </s>
<s>   when marianne
was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir
john had been previously forming were put into execution </s>
<s>   the private
balls at the park then began </s>
<s>  and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery october would allow </s>
<s>   in every
meeting of the kind willoughby was included </s>
<s>  and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the
dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving
in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her
affection </s>
<s> 

elinor could not be surprised at their attachment </s>
<s>   she only wished
that it were less openly shewn </s>
<s>  and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some selfcommand to marianne </s>
<s>   but marianne
abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve </s>
<s> 
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a
disgraceful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions </s>
<s> 
willoughby thought the same </s>
<s>  and their behaviour at all times was an
illustration of their opinions </s>
<s> 

when he was present she had no eyes for any one else </s>
<s>   every thing he
did was right </s>
<s>   every thing he said was clever </s>
<s>   if their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest
of the party to get her a good hand </s>
<s>   if dancing formed the amusement
of the night they were partners for half the time </s>
<s>  and when obliged to
separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and
scarcely spoke a word to any body else </s>
<s>   such conduct made them of
course most exceedingly laughed at </s>
<s>  but ridicule could not shame and
seemed hardly to provoke them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them </s>
<s>   to her
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
ardent mind </s>
<s> 

this was the season of happiness to marianne </s>
<s>   her heart was devoted to
willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with
her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it
possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her
present home </s>
<s> 

elinors happiness was not so great </s>
<s>   her heart was not so much at
ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure </s>
<s>   they afforded
her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind
nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than
ever </s>
<s>   neither lady middleton nor <abvr> jennings could supply to her the
conversation she missed </s>
<s>  although the latter was an everlasting talker
and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a
large share of her discourse </s>
<s>   she had already repeated her own history
to elinor three or four times </s>
<s>  and had elinors memory been equal to
her means of improvement she might have known very early in their
acquaintance all the particulars of <abvr> jenningss last illness and
what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died </s>
<s>   lady middleton
was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent </s>
<s>   elinor
needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere
calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do </s>
<s>   towards her
husband and mother she was the same as to them </s>
<s>  and intimacy was
therefore neither to be looked for nor desired </s>
<s>   she had nothing to say
one day that she had not said the day before </s>
<s>   her insipidity was
invariable for even her spirits were always the same </s>
<s>  and though she
did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every
thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her
she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might
have experienced in sitting at home </s>
<s> and so little did her presence
add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her
solicitude about her troublesome boys </s>
<s> 

in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite
the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion </s>
<s> 
willoughby was out of the question </s>
<s>   her admiration and regard even
her sisterly regard was all his own </s>
<s>  but he was a lover </s>
<s>  his
attentions were wholly mariannes and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing </s>
<s>   colonel brandon unfortunately for
himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in
conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her sister </s>
<s> 

elinors compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him </s>
<s> 
this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from
him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent while the others were dancing </s>
<s>   his eyes were fixed on
marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint
smile your sister i understand does not approve of second
attachments </s>
<s> 

no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic </s>
<s> 

or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist </s>
<s> 

i believe she does </s>
<s>   but how she contrives it without reflecting on
the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not </s>
<s> 
a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of
common sense and observation </s>
<s>  and then they may be more easy to define
and to justify than they now are by any body but herself </s>
<s> 

this will probably be the case he replied </s>
<s>  and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions </s>
<s> 

i cannot agree with you there said elinor </s>
<s>   there are
inconveniences attending such feelings as mariannes which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for </s>
<s>   her
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought </s>
<s>  and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward
to as her greatest possible advantage </s>
<s> 

after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying

does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a
second attachment </s>
<s>  or is it equally criminal in every body </s>
<s>   are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the
inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives </s>
<s> 

upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles </s>
<s> 
i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second
attachments being pardonable </s>
<s> 

this said he cannot hold </s>
<s>  but a change a total change of
sentimentsno no do not desire it </s>
<s>  for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous </s>
<s>   i
speak from experience </s>
<s>   i once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who
from an inforced changefrom a series of unfortunate circumstances
here he stopt suddenly </s>
<s>  appeared to think that he had said too much
and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not
otherwise have entered elinors head </s>
<s>   the lady would probably have
passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what
concerned her ought not to escape his lips </s>
<s>   as it was it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard </s>
<s>   elinor attempted no more </s>
<s>   but marianne
in her place would not have done so little </s>
<s>   the whole story would
have been speedily formed under her active imagination </s>
<s>  and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love </s>
<s> 



chapter 


as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite of
all that she knew before of mariannes imprudence and want of thought
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both </s>
<s>   marianne told her
with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one
that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman </s>
<s>   without considering that it was
not in her mothers plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter
her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the
servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable
to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and
told her sister of it in raptures </s>
<s> 

he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it
she added and when it arrives we will ride every day </s>
<s>   you shall
share its use with me </s>
<s>   imagine to yourself my dear elinor the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs </s>
<s> 

most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair </s>
<s>  and for
some time she refused to submit to them </s>
<s>   as to an additional servant
the expense would be a trifle </s>
<s>  mama she was sure would never object to
it </s>
<s>  and any horse would do for him </s>
<s>  he might always get one at the
park </s>
<s>  as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient </s>
<s>   elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a
man so little or at least so lately known to her </s>
<s>   this was too much </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken elinor said she warmly in supposing i know very
little of willoughby </s>
<s>   i have not known him long indeed but i am much
better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the
world except yourself and mama </s>
<s>   it is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy </s>
<s> it is disposition alone </s>
<s>   seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven
days are more than enough for others </s>
<s>   i should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from
willoughby </s>
<s>   of john i know very little though we have lived together
for years </s>
<s>  but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed </s>
<s> 

elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more </s>
<s>   she knew her
sisters temper </s>
<s>   opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her the more to her own opinion </s>
<s>   but by an appeal to her affection for
her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she
consented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly
subdued </s>
<s>  and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw
him next that it must be declined </s>
<s> 

she was faithful to her word </s>
<s>  and when willoughby called at the
cottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment to
him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his
present </s>
<s>   the reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side
impossible </s>
<s>   his concern however was very apparent </s>
<s>  and after
expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voicebut
marianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now </s>
<s>   i
shall keep it only till you can claim it </s>
<s>   when you leave barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall
receive you </s>
<s> 

this was all overheard by miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and in the whole of the
sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her
sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so
decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between
them </s>
<s>   from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each
other </s>
<s>  and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or
any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover
it by accident </s>
<s> 

margaret related something to her the next day which placed this
matter in a still clearer light </s>
<s>   willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour
with only him and marianne had had opportunity for observations
which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest
sister when they were next by themselves </s>
<s> 

oh elinor </s>
<s>  she cried i have such a secret to tell you about
marianne </s>
<s>   i am sure she will be married to <abvr> willoughby very soon </s>
<s> 

you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first
met on highchurch down </s>
<s>  and they had not known each other a week i
believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round
her neck </s>
<s>  but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle </s>
<s> 

but indeed this is quite another thing </s>
<s>   i am sure they will be
married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair </s>
<s> 

take care margaret </s>
<s>   it may be only the hair of some great uncle of
his </s>
<s> 

but indeed elinor it is mariannes </s>
<s>  i am almost sure it is for i
saw him cut it off </s>
<s>   last night after tea when you and mama went out
of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took
up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all
tumbled down her back </s>
<s>  and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of
white paper </s>
<s>  and put it into his pocketbook </s>
<s> 

for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not
withhold her credit </s>
<s>  nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself </s>
<s> 

margarets sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her sister </s>
<s>   when <abvr> jennings attacked her one evening at the
park to give the name of the young man who was elinors particular
favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her
margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not
tell may i elinor </s>
<s> 

this of course made every body laugh </s>
<s>  and elinor tried to laugh too </s>
<s> 
but the effort was painful </s>
<s>   she was convinced that margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

marianne felt for her most sincerely </s>
<s>  but she did more harm than good
to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
margaret

remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to
repeat them </s>
<s> 

i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret </s>
<s>  it was you
who told me of it yourself </s>
<s> 

this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  pray miss margaret let us know all about it said <abvr>
jennings </s>
<s>   what is the gentlemans name </s>
<s> 

i must not tell maam </s>
<s>  but i know very well what it is </s>
<s>  and i know
where he is too </s>
<s> 

yes yes we can guess where he is </s>
<s>  at his own house at norland to be
sure </s>
<s>   he is the curate of the parish i dare say </s>
<s> 

no that he is not </s>
<s>   he is of no profession at all </s>
<s> 

margaret said marianne with great warmth you know that all this is
an invention of your own and that there is no such person in
existence </s>
<s> 

well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such
a man once and his name begins with an f </s>
<s> 

most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this
moment that it rained very hard though she believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her
ladyships great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her husband and mother </s>
<s>   the idea however started by her was
immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others </s>
<s>  and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them </s>
<s>   willoughby opened the pianoforte and asked
marianne to sit down to it </s>
<s>  and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground </s>
<s>   but not so
easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her </s>
<s> 

a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
very fine place about twelve miles from barton belonging to a
brotherinlaw of colonel brandon without whose interest it could not
be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders
on that head </s>
<s>   the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and
sir john who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed
to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at
least twice every summer for the last ten years </s>
<s>   they contained a
noble piece of water </s>
<s>  a sail on which was to a form a great part of the
mornings amusement </s>
<s>  cold provisions were to be taken open carriages
only to be employed and every thing conducted in the usual style of a
complete party of pleasure </s>
<s> 

to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking
considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight </s>
<s> and <abvr> dashwood who had already a cold was
persuaded by elinor to stay at home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from
what elinor had expected </s>
<s>   she was prepared to be wet through
fatigued and frightened </s>
<s>  but the event was still more unfortunate for
they did not go at all </s>
<s> 

by ten oclock the whole party was assembled at the park where they
were to breakfast </s>
<s>   the morning was rather favourable though it had
rained all night as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky
and the sun frequently appeared </s>
<s>   they were all in high spirits and
good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the
greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise </s>
<s> 

while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in </s>
<s>   among the
rest there was one for colonel brandon </s>
<s> he took it looked at the
direction changed colour and immediately left the room </s>
<s> 

what is the matter with brandon </s>
<s>  said sir john </s>
<s> 

nobody could tell </s>
<s> 

i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton </s>
<s>   it must be
something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly </s>
<s> 

in about five minutes he returned </s>
<s> 

no bad news colonel i hope </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jennings as soon as he
entered the room </s>
<s> 

none at all maam i thank you </s>
<s> 

was it from avignon </s>
<s>   i hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse </s>
<s> 

no maam </s>
<s>  it came from town and is merely a letter of business </s>
<s> 

but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a
letter of business </s>
<s>   come come this wont do colonel </s>
<s>  so let us hear
the truth of it </s>
<s> 

my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying </s>
<s> 

perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married </s>
<s>  said
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings without attending to her daughters reproof </s>
<s> 

no indeed it is not </s>
<s> 

well then i know who it is from colonel </s>
<s>   and i hope she is well </s>
<s> 

whom do you mean maam </s>
<s>  said he colouring a little </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you know who i mean </s>
<s> 

i am particularly sorry maam said he addressing lady middleton
that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town </s>
<s> 

in town </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   what can you have to do in town at
this time of year </s>
<s> 

my own loss is great he continued in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party </s>
<s>  but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell </s>
<s> 

what a blow upon them all was this </s>
<s> 

but if you write a note to the housekeeper <abvr> brandon said
marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient </s>
<s> 

he shook his head </s>
<s> 

we must go said sir john </s>
<s> it shall not be put off when we are so
near it </s>
<s>   you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all </s>
<s> 

i wish it could be so easily settled </s>
<s>   but it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day </s>
<s> 

if you would but let us know what your business is said <abvr>
jennings we might see whether it could be put off or not </s>
<s> 

you would not be six hours later said willoughby if you were to
defer your journey till our return </s>
<s> 

i cannot afford to lose one hour </s>
<s> 

elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne there
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure </s>
<s>   brandon is one of
them </s>
<s>   he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this
trick for getting out of it </s>
<s>   i would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his own writing </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of it replied marianne </s>
<s> 

there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of
old said sir john when once you are determined on anything </s>
<s>   but
however i hope you will think better of it </s>
<s>   consider here are the
two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked
up from the cottage and <abvr> willoughby got up two hours before his
usual time on purpose to go to whitwell </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party </s>
<s>  but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable </s>
<s> 

well then when will you come back again </s>
<s> 

i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as
you can conveniently leave town </s>
<s>  and we must put off the party to
whitwell till you return </s>
<s> 

you are very obliging </s>
<s>   but it is so uncertain when i may have it in
my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he must and shall come back cried sir john </s>
<s>   if he is not here
by the end of the week i shall go after him </s>
<s> 

ay so do sir john cried <abvr> jennings and then perhaps you may
find out what his business is </s>
<s> 

i do not want to pry into other mens concerns </s>
<s>   i suppose it is
something he is ashamed of </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons horses were announced </s>
<s> 

you do not go to town on horseback do you </s>
<s>  added sir john </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  only to honiton </s>
<s>   i shall then go post </s>
<s> 

well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey </s>
<s>   but you
had better change your mind </s>
<s> 

i assure you it is not in my power </s>
<s> 

he then took leave of the whole party </s>
<s> 

is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

i am afraid none at all </s>
<s> 

then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to
do </s>
<s> 

to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing </s>
<s> 

come colonel said <abvr> jennings before you go do let us know what
you are going about </s>
<s> 

he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room </s>
<s> 

the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained now burst forth universally </s>
<s>  and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed </s>
<s> 

i can guess what his business is however said <abvr> jennings
exultingly </s>
<s> 

can you maam </s>
<s>  said almost every body </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  it is about miss williams i am sure </s>
<s> 

and who is miss williams </s>
<s>  asked marianne </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  do not you know who miss williams is </s>
<s>  i am sure you must have
heard of her before </s>
<s>   she is a relation of the colonels my dear </s>
<s>  a
very near relation </s>
<s>   we will not say how near for fear of shocking the
young ladies </s>
<s>  then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor
she is his natural daughter </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  and as like him as she can stare </s>
<s>   i dare say the colonel
will leave her all his fortune </s>
<s> 

when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event </s>
<s>  concluding however by observing that as
they were all got together they must do something by way of being
happy </s>
<s>  and after some consultation it was agreed that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country </s>
<s>   the
carriages were then ordered </s>
<s>  willoughbys was first and marianne never
looked happier than when she got into it </s>
<s>   he drove through the park
very fast and they were soon out of sight </s>
<s>  and nothing more of them
was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return
of all the rest </s>
<s>   they both seemed delighted with their drive </s>
<s>  but said
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others
went on the downs </s>
<s> 

it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long </s>
<s>   some more of the
careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment </s>
<s> 
willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings sat on elinors right hand </s>
<s>  and they had not been long
seated before she leant behind her and willoughby and said to
marianne loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in
spite of all your tricks </s>
<s>   i know where you spent the morning </s>
<s> 

marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray </s>
<s> 

did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in my
curricle </s>
<s> 

yes yes <abvr> impudence i know that very well and i was determined
to find out where you had been to </s>
<s>  i hope you like your house miss
marianne </s>
<s>   it is a very large one i know </s>
<s>  and when i come to see you
i hope you will have newfurnished it for it wanted it very much when
i was there six years ago </s>
<s> 

marianne turned away in great confusion </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings laughed
heartily </s>
<s>  and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they
had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of <abvr>
willoughbys groom </s>
<s>  and that she had by that method been informed that
they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house </s>
<s> 

elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely
that willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the house
while <abvr> smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

as soon as they left the diningroom elinor enquired of her about it </s>
<s> 
and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance
related by <abvr> jennings was perfectly true </s>
<s>   marianne was quite angry
with her for doubting it </s>
<s> 

why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we
did not see the house </s>
<s>   is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself </s>
<s> 

yes marianne but i would not go while <abvr> smith was there and with
no other companion than <abvr> willoughby </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew
that house </s>
<s>  and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to
have any other companion </s>
<s>   i never spent a pleasanter morning in my
life </s>
<s> 

i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety </s>
<s> 

on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor </s>
<s>  for if
there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been
sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting
wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure </s>
<s> 

but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct </s>
<s> 

if the impertinent remarks of <abvr> jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives </s>
<s> 
i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation </s>
<s>   i
am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over <abvr>
smiths grounds or in seeing her house </s>
<s>   they will one day be <abvr>
willoughbys and

if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be
justified in what you have done </s>
<s> 

she blushed at this hint </s>
<s>  but it was even visibly gratifying to her </s>
<s> 
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her
sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was
rather illjudged in me to go to allenham </s>
<s>  but <abvr> willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place </s>
<s>  and it is a charming house i assure
you </s>
<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs </s>
<s>  of a nice
comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would
be delightful </s>
<s>   it is a corner room and has windows on two sides </s>
<s>   on
one side you look across the bowlinggreen behind the house to a
beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church
and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired </s>
<s>   i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniturebut if it were newly fitted upa
couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the
pleasantest summerrooms in england </s>
<s> 

could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others
she would have described every room in the house with equal delight </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the sudden termination of colonel brandons visit at the park with his
steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the
wonder of <abvr> jennings for two or three days </s>
<s>  she was a great
wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance </s>
<s>   she wondered with
little intermission what could be the reason of it </s>
<s>  was sure there must
be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could
have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape
them all </s>
<s> 

something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she </s>
<s> 
i could see it in his face </s>
<s>   poor man </s>
<s>   i am afraid his circumstances
may be bad </s>
<s>   the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved </s>
<s>   i do
think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can
it be </s>
<s>   i wonder whether it is so </s>
<s>   i would give anything to know the
truth of it </s>
<s>   perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare
say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her </s>
<s>   may be
she is ill in town </s>
<s>  nothing in the world more likely for i have a
notion she is always rather sickly </s>
<s>   i would lay any wager it is about
miss williams </s>
<s>   it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his
circumstances now for he is a very prudent man and to be sure must
have cleared the estate by this time </s>
<s>   i wonder what it can be </s>
<s>   may be
his sister is worse at avignon and has sent for him over </s>
<s>   his setting
off in such a hurry seems very like it </s>
<s>   well i wish him out of all
his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain </s>
<s> 

so wondered so talked <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   her opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose </s>
<s> 
elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel
brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away
which <abvr> jennings was desirous of her feeling </s>
<s>  for besides that the
circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of </s>
<s>   it was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on
the subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all </s>
<s>   as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both </s>
<s>   why they should
not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not
imagine </s>
<s> 

she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power </s>
<s>  for though willoughby was independent there was no reason
to believe him rich </s>
<s>   his estate had been rated by sir john at about
six or seven hundred a year </s>
<s>  but he lived at an expense to which that
income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of
his poverty </s>
<s>   but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all
she could not account </s>
<s>  and it was so wholly contradictory to their
general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her
making any inquiry of marianne </s>
<s> 

nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than
willoughbys behaviour </s>
<s>   to marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lovers heart could give and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother </s>
<s>   the
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home </s>
<s>  many more
of his hours were spent there than at allenham </s>
<s>  and if no general
engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his
favourite pointer at her feet </s>
<s> 

one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left the
country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him </s>
<s>  and on <abvr> dashwoods happening
to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly
opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
perfect with him </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  he exclaimedimprove this dear cottage </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  that i will
never consent to </s>
<s>   not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch
to its size if my feelings are regarded </s>
<s> 

do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will be
done </s>
<s>  for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it </s>
<s> 

i am heartily glad of it he cried </s>
<s>   may she always be poor if she
can employ her riches no better </s>
<s> 

thank you willoughby </s>
<s>   but you may be assured that i would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one
whom i loved for all the improvements in the world </s>
<s>   depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in
the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you </s>
<s>   but are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it </s>
<s> 

i am said he </s>
<s>   to me it is faultless </s>
<s>   nay more i consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i
rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in
the exact plan of this cottage </s>
<s> 

with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said
elinor </s>
<s> 

yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing
belonging to it </s>
<s> in no one convenience or inconvenience about it
should the least variation be perceptible </s>
<s>   then and then only under
such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at
barton </s>
<s> 

i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this </s>
<s> 

there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might
greatly endear it to me </s>
<s>  but this place will always have one claim of
my affection which no other can possibly share </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she
understood him </s>
<s> 

how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time
twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited </s>
<s>   i never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one
should live in it </s>
<s>   how little did i then think that the very first
news i should hear from <abvr> smith when i next came into the country
would be that barton cottage was taken </s>
<s>  and i felt an immediate
satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of
prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account
for </s>
<s>   must it not have been so marianne </s>
<s>  speaking to her in a lowered
voice </s>
<s>   then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house
you would spoil <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   you would rob it of its simplicity by
imaginary improvement </s>
<s>  and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance
and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
could possibly afford </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted </s>
<s> 

you are a good woman he warmly replied </s>
<s>   your promise makes me
easy </s>
<s>   extend it a little farther and it will make me happy </s>
<s>   tell me
that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever
find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling </s>
<s>  and that you will
always consider me with the kindness which has made everything
belonging to you so dear to me </s>
<s> 

the promise was readily given and willoughbys behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness </s>
<s> 

shall we see you tomorrow to dinner </s>
<s>  said <abvr> dashwood when he was
leaving them </s>
<s>   i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must
walk to the park to call on lady middleton </s>
<s> 

he engaged to be with them by four oclock </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place the next day and
two of her daughters went with her </s>
<s>  but marianne excused herself from
being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment </s>
<s>  and her
mother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the
night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly
satisfied with her remaining at home </s>
<s> 

on their return from the park they found willoughbys curricle and
servant in waiting at the cottage and <abvr> dashwood was convinced that
her conjecture had been just </s>
<s>   so far it was all as she had foreseen </s>
<s> 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her
to expect </s>
<s>   they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came
hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her
handkerchief at her eyes </s>
<s>  and without noticing them ran up stairs </s>
<s> 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had
just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against
the mantelpiece with his back towards them </s>
<s>   he turned round on their
coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the
emotion which overpowered marianne </s>
<s> 

is anything the matter with her </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> dashwood as she
enteredis she ill </s>
<s> 

i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful </s>
<s>  and with a forced
smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be illfor i
am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment </s>
<s> 

disappointment </s>
<s> 

yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you </s>
<s>   <abvr> smith has
this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
cousin by sending me on business to london </s>
<s>   i have just received my
dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham </s>
<s>  and by way of
exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you </s>
<s> 

to london </s>
<s> and are you going this morning </s>
<s> 

almost this moment </s>
<s> 

this is very unfortunate </s>
<s>   but <abvr> smith must be obliged </s>
<s> and her
business will not detain you from us long i hope </s>
<s> 

he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of
returning into devonshire immediately </s>
<s>   my visits to <abvr> smith are
never repeated within the twelvemonth </s>
<s> 

and is <abvr> smith your only friend </s>
<s>   is allenham the only house in the
neighbourhood to which you will be welcome </s>
<s>   for shame willoughby can
you wait for an invitation here </s>
<s> 

his colour increased </s>
<s>  and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only
replied you are too good </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood looked at elinor with surprise </s>
<s>   elinor felt equal
amazement </s>
<s>   for a few moments every one was silent </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood
first spoke </s>
<s> 

i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you
will always be welcome </s>
<s>  for i will not press you to return here
immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing
to <abvr> smith </s>
<s>  and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclination </s>
<s> 

my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of
such a naturethati dare not flatter myself

he stopt </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another
pause succeeded </s>
<s>   this was broken by willoughby who said with a faint
smile it is folly to linger in this manner </s>
<s>   i will not torment
myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is
impossible for me now to enjoy </s>
<s> 

he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room </s>
<s>   they saw him
step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the
parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
sudden departure occasioned </s>
<s> 

elinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers </s>
<s>   she thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust </s>
<s>   willoughbys behaviour
in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of
cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mothers
invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself
greatly disturbed her </s>
<s>   one moment she feared that no serious design
had ever been formed on his side </s>
<s>  and the next that some unfortunate
quarrel had taken place between him and her sister </s>
<s> the distress in
which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
most reasonably account for though when she considered what mariannes
love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible </s>
<s> 

but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sisters
affliction was indubitable </s>
<s>  and she thought with the tenderest
compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability
not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a
duty </s>
<s> 

in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were
red her countenance was not uncheerful </s>
<s> 

our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she
as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel </s>
<s> 

it is all very strange </s>
<s>   so suddenly to be gone </s>
<s>  it seems but the work
of a moment </s>
<s>   and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so
affectionate </s>
<s>   and now after only ten minutes noticegone too without
intending to return </s>
<s> something more than what he owned to us must have
happened </s>
<s>   he did not speak he did not behave like himself </s>
<s>   you must
have seen the difference as well as i </s>
<s>   what can it be </s>
<s>   can they have
quarrelled </s>
<s>   why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept
your invitation here </s>
<s> 

it was not inclination that he wanted elinor </s>
<s>  i could plainly see
that </s>
<s>   he had not the power of accepting it </s>
<s>   i have thought it all
over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you </s>
<s> 

can you indeed </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way </s>
<s> but
you elinor who love to doubt where you canit will not satisfy you
i know </s>
<s>  but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it </s>
<s>   i am
persuaded that <abvr> smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves
of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that
account is eager to get him away </s>
<s> and that the business which she
sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him </s>
<s> 
this is what i believe to have happened </s>
<s>   he is moreover aware that
she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present
confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself
obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and
absent himself from devonshire for a while </s>
<s>   you will tell me i know
that this may or may not have happened </s>
<s>  but i will listen to no cavil
unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
as satisfactory at this </s>
<s>   and now elinor what have you to say </s>
<s> 

nothing for you have anticipated my answer </s>
<s> 

then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened </s>
<s> 
oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings </s>
<s>   you had rather
take evil upon credit than good </s>
<s>   you had rather look out for misery
for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the
latter </s>
<s>   you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave
of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn </s>
<s>   and is
no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by
recent disappointment </s>
<s>   are no probabilities to be accepted merely
because they are not certainties </s>
<s>   is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill
of </s>
<s>   to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though
unavoidably secret for a while </s>
<s>   and after all what is it you suspect
him of </s>
<s> 

i can hardly tell myself </s>
<s>   but suspicion of something unpleasant is
the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
in him </s>
<s>   there is great truth however in what you have now urged of
the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be
candid in my judgment of every body </s>
<s>   willoughby may undoubtedly have
very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has </s>
<s> 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at
once </s>
<s>   secrecy may be advisable </s>
<s>  but still i cannot help wondering at
its being practiced by him </s>
<s> 

do not blame him however for departing from his character where the
deviation is necessary </s>
<s>   but you really do admit the justice of what i
have said in his defence </s>
<s> i am happyand he is acquitted </s>
<s> 

not entirely </s>
<s>   it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they
are engaged from <abvr> smithand if that is the case it must be
highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at
present </s>
<s>   but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us </s>
<s> 

concealing it from us </s>
<s>  my dear child do you accuse willoughby and
marianne of concealment </s>
<s>  this is strange indeed when your eyes have
been reproaching them every day for incautiousness </s>
<s> 

i want no proof of their affection said elinor </s>
<s>  but of their
engagement i do </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly satisfied of both </s>
<s> 

yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of
them </s>
<s> 

i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly </s>
<s>   has
not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last
fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future
wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation </s>
<s> 
have we not perfectly understood each other </s>
<s>   has not my consent been
daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate
respect </s>
<s>   my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement </s>
<s>   how
could such a thought occur to you </s>
<s>   how is it to be supposed that
willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sisters love should leave
her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his
affection </s>
<s> that they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence </s>
<s> 

i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is in
favour of their engagement </s>
<s>  but that one is the total silence of both
on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other </s>
<s> 

how strange this is </s>
<s>   you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby
if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the
nature of the terms on which they are together </s>
<s>   has he been acting a
part in his behaviour to your sister all this time </s>
<s>   do you suppose him
really indifferent to her </s>
<s> 

no i cannot think that </s>
<s>   he must and does love her i am sure </s>
<s> 

but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such
indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him </s>
<s> 

you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this
matter as certain </s>
<s>   i have had my doubts i confess </s>
<s>  but they are
fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away </s>
<s>   if we
find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed </s>
<s> 

a mighty concession indeed </s>
<s>   if you were to see them at the altar you
would suppose they were going to be married </s>
<s>   ungracious girl </s>
<s>   but i
require no such proof </s>
<s>   nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
justify doubt </s>
<s>  no secrecy has been attempted </s>
<s>  all has been uniformly
open and unreserved </s>
<s>   you cannot doubt your sisters wishes </s>
<s>   it must
be willoughby therefore whom you suspect </s>
<s>   but why </s>
<s>   is he not a man of
honour and feeling </s>
<s>  has there been any inconsistency on his side to
create alarm </s>
<s>  can he be deceitful </s>
<s> 

i hope not i believe not cried elinor </s>
<s>   i love willoughby
sincerely love him </s>
<s>  and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me </s>
<s>   it has been involuntary and i will
not encourage it </s>
<s>   i was startled i confess by the alteration in his
manners this morning </s>
<s> he did not speak like himself and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality </s>
<s>   but all this may be
explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed </s>
<s>   he
had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest
affliction </s>
<s>  and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending <abvr>
smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware
that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for
some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by
our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed </s>
<s>   in such a
case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more
to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general
character </s>
<s> but i will not raise objections against any ones conduct
on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself
or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent </s>
<s> 

you speak very properly </s>
<s>   willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
suspected </s>
<s>   though we have not known him long he is no stranger in
this part of the world </s>
<s>  and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage </s>
<s> 
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately
it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging
everything to me at once </s>
<s>  but this is not the case </s>
<s>   it is an
engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage
must be at a very uncertain distance </s>
<s>  and even secrecy as far as it
can be observed may now be very advisable </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret </s>
<s>  and elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to
acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all </s>
<s> 

they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the
room and took her place at the table without saying a word </s>
<s>   her eyes
were red and swollen </s>
<s>  and it seemed as if her tears were even then
restrained with difficulty </s>
<s>   she avoided the looks of them all could
neither eat nor speak and after some time on her mothers silently
pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude
was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room </s>
<s> 

this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening </s>
<s>   she
was without any power because she was without any desire of command
over herself </s>
<s>   the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby
overpowered her in an instant </s>
<s>  and though her family were most
anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they
spoke at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings
connected with him </s>
<s> 



chapter 


marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby </s>
<s>   she
would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next
morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than
when she lay down in it </s>
<s>   but the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it </s>
<s>   she was awake the
whole night and she wept the greatest part of it </s>
<s>   she got up with a
headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment </s>
<s> 
giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding all
attempt at consolation from either </s>
<s>   her sensibility was potent enough </s>
<s> 

when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about
the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning </s>
<s> 

the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling </s>
<s>   she played
over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby
every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at
the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out
for her till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
gained </s>
<s>  and this nourishment of grief was every day applied </s>
<s>   she spent
whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying </s>
<s>  her voice
often totally suspended by her tears </s>
<s>   in books too as well as in
music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
present was certain of giving </s>
<s>   she read nothing but what they had been
used to read together </s>
<s> 

such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever </s>
<s>  it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy </s>
<s>  but these employments
to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations
still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever </s>
<s> 

no letter from willoughby came </s>
<s>  and none seemed expected by marianne </s>
<s> 
her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at
least satisfied herself </s>
<s> 

remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our
letters himself from the post and carries them to it </s>
<s>   we have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
sir johns hands </s>
<s> 

elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence </s>
<s>   but there was one method so
direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she
could not help suggesting it to her mother </s>
<s> 

why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she
is not engaged to willoughby </s>
<s>   from you her mother and so kind so
indulgent a mother the question could not give offence </s>
<s>   it would be
the natural result of your affection for her </s>
<s>   she used to be all
unreserve and to you more especially </s>
<s> 

i would not ask such a question for the world </s>
<s>   supposing it possible
that they are not engaged what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict </s>
<s>   at any rate it would be most ungenerous </s>
<s>   i should never
deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one </s>
<s>   i know
mariannes heart </s>
<s>  i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not
be the last to whom the affair is made known when circumstances make
the revealment of it eligible </s>
<s>   i would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one </s>
<s>  of a child much less </s>
<s>  because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct </s>
<s> 

elinor thought this generosity overstrained considering her sisters
youth and urged the matter farther but in vain </s>
<s>  common sense common
care common prudence were all sunk in <abvr> dashwoods romantic
delicacy </s>
<s> 

it was several days before willoughbys name was mentioned before
marianne by any of her family </s>
<s>  sir john and <abvr> jennings indeed were
not so nice </s>
<s>  their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour </s>
<s> but
one evening <abvr> dashwood accidentally taking up a volume of
shakespeare exclaimed

we have never finished hamlet marianne </s>
<s>  our dear willoughby went away
before we could get through it </s>
<s>   we will put it by that when he comes
again </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but it may be months perhaps before that happens </s>
<s> 

months </s>
<s>  cried marianne with strong surprise </s>
<s>   nonor many weeks </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was sorry for what she had said </s>
<s>  but it gave elinor
pleasure as it produced a reply from marianne so expressive of
confidence in willoughby and knowledge of his intentions </s>
<s> 

one morning about a week after his leaving the country marianne was
prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of
wandering away by herself </s>
<s>   hitherto she had carefully avoided every
companion in her rambles </s>
<s>   if her sisters intended to walk on the
downs she directly stole away towards the lanes </s>
<s>  if they talked of the
valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills and could never be
found when the others set off </s>
<s>   but at length she was secured by the
exertions of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion </s>
<s> 
they walked along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence
for mariannes mind could not be controlled and elinor satisfied with
gaining one point would not then attempt more </s>
<s>   beyond the entrance of
the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and
more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
coming to barton lay before them </s>
<s>  and on reaching that point they
stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the
distance of their view from the cottage from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before </s>
<s> 

amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered an animated one </s>
<s> 
it was a man on horseback riding towards them </s>
<s>   in a few minutes they
could distinguish him to be a gentleman </s>
<s>  and in a moment afterwards
marianne rapturously exclaimed

it is he </s>
<s>  it is indeed </s>
<s> i know it is </s>
<s> and was hastening to meet
him when elinor cried out

indeed marianne i think you are mistaken </s>
<s>   it is not willoughby </s>
<s> 
the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air </s>
<s> 

he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has </s>
<s>   his air his
coat his horse </s>
<s>   i knew how soon he would come </s>
<s> 

she walked eagerly on as she spoke </s>
<s>  and elinor to screen marianne from
particularity as she felt almost certain of its not being willoughby
quickened her pace and kept up with her </s>
<s>   they were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman </s>
<s>   marianne looked again </s>
<s>  her heart sunk within
her </s>
<s>  and abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when the voices
of both her sisters were raised to detain her </s>
<s>  a third almost as well
known as willoughbys joined them in begging her to stop and she
turned round with surprise to see and welcome edward ferrars </s>
<s> 

he was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
forgiven for not being willoughby </s>
<s>  the only one who could have gained a
smile from her </s>
<s>  but she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her
sisters happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment </s>
<s> 

he dismounted and giving his horse to his servant walked back with
them to barton whither he was purposely coming to visit them </s>
<s> 

he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality but especially by
marianne who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than
even elinor herself </s>
<s>   to marianne indeed the meeting between edward
and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour </s>
<s>   on
edwards side more particularly there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion </s>
<s>   he was confused
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them looked neither
rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by
questions and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection </s>
<s>   marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise </s>
<s>   she began almost to feel a
dislike of edward </s>
<s>  and it ended as every feeling must end with her by
carrying back her thoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect </s>
<s> 

after a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting marianne asked edward if he came directly from london </s>
<s>   no
he had been in devonshire a fortnight </s>
<s> 

a fortnight </s>
<s>  she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same
county with elinor without seeing her before </s>
<s> 

he looked rather distressed as he added that he had been staying with
some friends near plymouth </s>
<s> 

have you been lately in sussex </s>
<s>  said elinor </s>
<s> 

i was at norland about a month ago </s>
<s> 

and how does dear dear norland look </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s> 

dear dear norland said elinor probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year </s>
<s>   the woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves </s>
<s> 

oh cried marianne with what transporting sensation have i formerly
seen them fall </s>
<s>   how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven
in showers about me by the wind </s>
<s>   what feelings have they the season
the air altogether inspired </s>
<s>   now there is no one to regard them </s>
<s>   they
are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as
possible from the sight </s>
<s> 

it is not every one said elinor who has your passion for dead
leaves </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  my feelings are not often shared not often understood </s>
<s>   but
sometimes they are </s>
<s> as she said this she sunk into a reverie for a
few moments </s>
<s> but rousing herself again now edward said she
calling his attention to the prospect here is barton valley </s>
<s>   look up
to it and be tranquil if you can </s>
<s>   look at those hills </s>
<s>   did you ever
see their equals </s>
<s>   to the left is barton park amongst those woods and
plantations </s>
<s>   you may see the end of the house </s>
<s>   and there beneath
that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage </s>
<s> 

it is a beautiful country he replied </s>
<s>  but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter </s>
<s> 

how can you think of dirt with such objects before you </s>
<s> 

because replied he smiling among the rest of the objects before
me i see a very dirty lane </s>
<s> 

how strange </s>
<s>  said marianne to herself as she walked on </s>
<s> 

have you an agreeable neighbourhood here </s>
<s>   are the middletons pleasant
people </s>
<s> 

no not all answered marianne </s>
<s>  we could not be more unfortunately
situated </s>
<s> 

marianne cried her sister how can you say so </s>
<s>  how can you be so
unjust </s>
<s>   they are a very respectable family <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  and towards
us have behaved in the friendliest manner </s>
<s>   have you forgot marianne
how many pleasant days we have owed to them </s>
<s> 

no said marianne in a low voice nor how many painful moments </s>
<s> 

elinor took no notice of this </s>
<s>  and directing her attention to their
visitor endeavoured to support something like discourse with him by
talking of their present residence its conveniences &c </s>
<s>  extorting
from him occasional questions and remarks </s>
<s>   his coldness and reserve
mortified her severely </s>
<s>  she was vexed and half angry </s>
<s>  but resolving to
regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present she
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him
as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him </s>
<s>  for his
coming to barton was in her opinion of all things the most natural </s>
<s> 
her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder </s>
<s>   he received
the kindest welcome from her </s>
<s>  and shyness coldness reserve could not
stand against such a reception </s>
<s>   they had begun to fail him before he
entered the house and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her </s>
<s>  and
elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like
himself </s>
<s>   his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all and his
interest in their welfare again became perceptible </s>
<s>   he was not in
spirits however </s>
<s>  he praised their house admired its prospect was
attentive and kind </s>
<s>  but still he was not in spirits </s>
<s>   the whole family
perceived it and <abvr> dashwood attributing it to some want of
liberality in his mother sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents </s>
<s> 

what are <abvr> ferrarss views for you at present edward </s>
<s>  said she
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire </s>
<s>  are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than
inclination for a public life </s>
<s> 

but how is your fame to be established </s>
<s>  for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family </s>
<s>  and with no inclination for expense no
affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find
it a difficult matter </s>
<s> 

i shall not attempt it </s>
<s>   i have no wish to be distinguished </s>
<s>  and have
every reason to hope i never shall </s>
<s>   thank heaven </s>
<s>  i cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence </s>
<s> 

you have no ambition i well know </s>
<s>   your wishes are all moderate </s>
<s> 

as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe </s>
<s>   i wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy </s>
<s>  but like every body
else it must be in my own way </s>
<s>   greatness will not make me so </s>
<s> 

strange that it would </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s>   what have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness </s>
<s> 

grandeur has but little said elinor but wealth has much to do with
it </s>
<s> 

elinor for shame </s>
<s>  said marianne money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it </s>
<s>   beyond a competence it can
afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned </s>
<s> 

perhaps said elinor smiling we may come to the same point </s>
<s>   your
competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say </s>
<s>  and without
them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting </s>
<s>   your ideas are only more noble than
mine </s>
<s>   come what is your competence </s>
<s> 

about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year </s>
<s>  not more than that </s>
<s> 

elinor laughed </s>
<s>   two thousand a year </s>
<s>  one is my wealth </s>
<s>  i guessed how
it would end </s>
<s> 

and yet two thousand ayear is a very moderate income said marianne </s>
<s> 
a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller </s>
<s>   i am sure i am not
extravagant in my demands </s>
<s>   a proper establishment of servants a
carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less </s>
<s> 

elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at combe magna </s>
<s> 

hunters </s>
<s>  repeated edwardbut why must you have hunters </s>
<s>   every body
does not hunt </s>
<s> 

marianne coloured as she replied but most people do </s>
<s> 

i wish said margaret striking out a novel thought that somebody
would give us all a large fortune apiece </s>
<s> 

oh that they would </s>
<s>  cried marianne her eyes sparkling with
animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness </s>
<s> 

we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose said elinor in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth </s>
<s> 

oh dear </s>
<s>  cried margaret how happy i should be </s>
<s>   i wonder what i
should do with it </s>
<s> 

marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point </s>
<s> 

i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself said <abvr>
dashwood if my children were all to be rich without my help </s>
<s> 

you must begin your improvements on this house observed elinor and
your difficulties will soon vanish </s>
<s> 

what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london said
edward in such an event </s>
<s>   what a happy day for booksellers
musicsellers and printshops </s>
<s>   you miss dashwood would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent youand as
for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music
enough in london to content her </s>
<s>   and books </s>
<s> thomson cowper
scottshe would buy them all over and over again </s>
<s>  she would buy up
every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands </s>
<s> 
and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old
twisted tree </s>
<s>   should not you marianne </s>
<s>   forgive me if i am very
saucy </s>
<s>   but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our old
disputes </s>
<s> 

i love to be reminded of the past edwardwhether it be melancholy or
gay i love to recall itand you will never offend me by talking of
former times </s>
<s>   you are very right in supposing how my money would be
spentsome of it at leastmy loose cash would certainly be employed
in improving my collection of music and books </s>
<s> 

and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs </s>
<s> 

no edward i should have something else to do with it </s>
<s> 

perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their lifeyour opinion on that point is
unchanged i presume </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed </s>
<s>   it is
not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them </s>
<s> 

marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor she is not
at all altered </s>
<s> 

she is only grown a little more grave than she was </s>
<s> 

nay edward said marianne you need not reproach me </s>
<s>   you are not
very gay yourself </s>
<s> 

why should you think so </s>
<s>  replied he with a sigh </s>
<s>   but gaiety never
was a part of my character </s>
<s> 

nor do i think it a part of mariannes said elinor </s>
<s>  i should hardly
call her a lively girlshe is very earnest very eager in all she
doessometimes talks a great deal and always with animationbut she
is not often really merry </s>
<s> 

i believe you are right he replied and yet i have always set her
down as a lively girl </s>
<s> 

i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes said
elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other </s>
<s>  fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or
stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated </s>
<s>   sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge </s>
<s> 

but i thought it was right elinor said marianne to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people </s>
<s>   i thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours </s>
<s>   this has
always been your doctrine i am sure </s>
<s> 

no marianne never </s>
<s>   my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding </s>
<s>   all i have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour </s>
<s>   you must not confound my meaning </s>
<s>   i am guilty i confess
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention </s>
<s>  but when have i advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters </s>
<s> 

you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility said edward to elinor </s>
<s>   do you gain no ground </s>
<s> 

quite the contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne </s>
<s> 

my judgment he returned is all on your side of the question </s>
<s>  but i
am afraid my practice is much more on your sisters </s>
<s>   i never wish to
offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness </s>
<s>   i have frequently thought
that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility </s>
<s> 

marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers said
elinor </s>
<s> 

she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied edward </s>
<s> 
shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other </s>
<s>   if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful i should not be shy </s>
<s> 

but you would still be reserved said marianne and that is worse </s>
<s> 

edward startedreserved </s>
<s>  am i reserved marianne </s>
<s> 

yes very </s>
<s> 

i do not understand you replied he colouring </s>
<s>   reserved </s>
<s> how in
what manner </s>
<s>   what am i to tell you </s>
<s>   what can you suppose </s>
<s> 

elinor looked surprised at his emotion </s>
<s>  but trying to laugh off the
subject she said to him do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she means </s>
<s>   do not you know she calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as
rapturously as herself </s>
<s> 

edward made no answer </s>
<s>   his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him
in their fullest extentand he sat for some time silent and dull </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend </s>
<s>   his
visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction while his own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect </s>
<s>   it was evident that he was
unhappy </s>
<s>  she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished
her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of
inspiring </s>
<s>  but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very
uncertain </s>
<s>  and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one </s>
<s> 

he joined her and marianne in the breakfastroom the next morning
before the others were down </s>
<s>  and marianne who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to
themselves </s>
<s>   but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour
door open and turning round was astonished to see edward himself
come out </s>
<s> 

i am going into the village to see my horses said he as you are
not yet ready for breakfast </s>
<s>  i shall be back again presently </s>
<s> 

                    

edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country </s>
<s>  in his walk to the village he had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage </s>
<s>  and the village itself in a much higher situation
than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had
exceedingly pleased him </s>
<s>   this was a subject which ensured mariannes
attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of
these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had
particularly struck him when edward interrupted her by saying you
must not enquire too far marianneremember i have no knowledge in the
picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
if we come to particulars </s>
<s>   i shall call hills steep which ought to be
bold </s>
<s>  surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and
rugged </s>
<s>  and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere </s>
<s>   you must be
satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give </s>
<s>   i call it a
very fine countrythe hills are steep the woods seem full of fine
timber and the valley looks comfortable and snugwith rich meadows
and several neat farm houses scattered here and there </s>
<s>   it exactly
answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with
utilityand i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire
it </s>
<s>  i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey
moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me </s>
<s>   i know nothing of
the picturesque </s>
<s> 

i am afraid it is but too true said marianne </s>
<s>  but why should you
boast of it </s>
<s> 

i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation
edward here falls into another </s>
<s>   because he believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater
indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he
possesses </s>
<s>   he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own </s>
<s> 

it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon </s>
<s>   every body pretends to feel and tries to
describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was </s>
<s>   i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i
have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning </s>
<s> 

i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in
a fine prospect which you profess to feel </s>
<s>   but in return your sister
must allow me to feel no more than i profess </s>
<s>   i like a fine prospect
but not on picturesque principles </s>
<s>   i do not like crooked twisted
blasted trees </s>
<s>   i admire them much more if they are tall straight and
flourishing </s>
<s>   i do not like ruined tattered cottages </s>
<s>   i am not fond
of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms </s>
<s>   i have more pleasure in a
snug farmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy happy villages
please me better than the finest banditti in the world </s>
<s> 

marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her
sister </s>
<s>   elinor only laughed </s>
<s> 

the subject was continued no farther </s>
<s>  and marianne remained
thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly engaged her attention </s>
<s> 
she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from <abvr> dashwood
his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait
of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers </s>
<s> 

i never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried </s>
<s>   is that
fannys hair </s>
<s>  i remember her promising to give you some </s>
<s>   but i should
have thought her hair had been darker </s>
<s> 

marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really feltbut when she saw
how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought
could not be surpassed by his </s>
<s>   he coloured very deeply and giving a
momentary glance at elinor replied yes </s>
<s>  it is my sisters hair </s>
<s>   the
setting always casts a different shade on it you know </s>
<s> 

elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise </s>
<s>   that the hair
was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne </s>
<s> 
the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne
considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself </s>
<s> 
she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and
affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of
something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all
doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own </s>
<s> 

edwards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled </s>
<s>   he was particularly grave the whole morning </s>
<s> 
marianne severely censured herself for what she had said </s>
<s>  but her own
forgiveness might have been more speedy had she known how little
offence it had given her sister </s>
<s> 

before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and <abvr>
jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage came to take a survey of the guest </s>
<s>   with the assistance of
his motherinlaw sir john was not long in discovering that the name
of ferrars began with an f </s>
<s>  and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung </s>
<s>   but as it was she only learned from some very significant
looks how far their penetration founded on margarets instructions
extended </s>
<s> 

sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening </s>
<s> 
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor
towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished
to engage them for both </s>
<s> 

you must drink tea with us to night said he for we shall be quite
aloneand tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a
large party </s>

a dance </s>

who </s>

<s> 
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
nameless is gone </s>
<s> 

i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among
us again </s>
<s> 

this and mariannes blushing gave new suspicions to edward </s>

is willoughby </s>

was sitting </s>

she gave him a brief reply </s>

what do you mean </s>

certainly </s>

well then </s>

marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his manner and after a moments silence said

oh edward </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i am sure
you will like him </s>
<s> 

i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness
and warmth </s>

chapter 


edward remained a week at the cottage </s>
<s>  he was earnestly pressed by <abvr>
dashwood to stay longer </s>
<s>  but as if he were bent only on
selfmortification he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment
among his friends was at the height </s>
<s>   his spirits during the last two
or three days though still very unequal were greatly improvedhe
grew more and more partial to the house and environsnever spoke of
going away without a sighdeclared his time to be wholly
disengagedeven doubted to what place he should go when he left
thembut still go he must </s>
<s>   never had any week passed so quicklyhe
could hardly believe it to be gone </s>
<s>   he said so repeatedly </s>
<s>  other
things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the
lie to his actions </s>
<s>   he had no pleasure at norland </s>
<s>  he detested being
in town </s>
<s>  but either to norland or london he must go </s>
<s>   he valued their
kindness beyond any thing and his greatest happiness was in being with
them </s>
<s>   yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their
wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time </s>
<s> 

elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his
mothers account </s>
<s>  and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her son </s>
<s>   disappointed however
and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain
behaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regard
his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for
willoughbys service by her mother </s>
<s>   his want of spirits of openness
and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of
independence and his better knowledge of <abvr> ferrarss disposition
and designs </s>
<s>   the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose
in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same
inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother </s>
<s>   the old
wellestablished grievance of duty against will parent against child
was the cause of all </s>
<s>   she would have been glad to know when these
difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yieldwhen <abvr>
ferrars would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy </s>
<s>   but
from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
of her confidence in edwards affection to the remembrance of every
mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton and
above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round
his finger </s>
<s> 

i think edward said <abvr> dashwood as they were at breakfast the
last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions </s>
<s>   some
inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from ityou would
not be able to give them so much of your time </s>
<s>   but with a smile you
would be materially benefited in one particular at leastyou would
know where to go when you left them </s>
<s> 

i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point
as you think now </s>
<s>   it has been and is and probably will always be a
heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage
me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like
independence </s>
<s>   but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my
friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being </s>
<s>   we never
could agree in our choice of a profession </s>
<s>   i always preferred the
church as i still do </s>
<s>   but that was not smart enough for my family </s>
<s> 
they recommended the army </s>
<s>   that was a great deal too smart for me </s>
<s> 
the law was allowed to be genteel enough </s>
<s>  many young men who had
chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first
circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs </s>
<s>   but i had no
inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which
my family approved </s>
<s>   as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i
was too old when the subject was first started to enter itand at
length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all
as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as
with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous
and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so
earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
friends to do nothing </s>
<s>   i was therefore entered at oxford and have been
properly idle ever since </s>
<s> 

the consequence of which i suppose will be said <abvr> dashwood
since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will
be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades
as columellas </s>
<s> 

they will be brought up said he in a serious accent to be as
unlike myself as is possible </s>
<s>   in feeling in action in condition in
every thing </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits
edward </s>
<s>   you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike
yourself must be happy </s>
<s>   but remember that the pain of parting from
friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their
education or state </s>
<s>   know your own happiness </s>
<s>   you want nothing but
patienceor give it a more fascinating name call it hope </s>
<s>   your
mother will secure to you in time that independence you are so
anxious for </s>
<s>  it is her duty and it will it must ere long become her
happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent </s>
<s> 
how much may not a few months do </s>
<s> 

i think replied edward that i may defy many months to produce any
good to me </s>
<s> 

this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which
shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on elinors
feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue </s>
<s> 
but as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his
going away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
marianne on a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow by
seeking silence solitude and idleness </s>
<s>   their means were as different
as their objects and equally suited to the advancement of each </s>
<s> 

elinor sat down to her drawingtable as soon as he was out of the
house busily employed herself the whole day neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as
much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this
conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her account </s>
<s> 

such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no
more meritorious to marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her </s>
<s> 
the business of selfcommand she settled very easily </s>
<s> with strong
affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit </s>
<s> 
that her sisters affections were calm she dared not deny though she
blushed to acknowledge it </s>
<s>  and of the strength of her own she gave a
very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in
spite of this mortifying conviction </s>
<s> 

without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
to think of edward and of edwards behaviour in every possible
variety which the different state of her spirits at different times
could producewith tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt </s>
<s> 
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her
mother and sisters at least by the nature of their employments
conversation was forbidden among them and every effect of solitude was
produced </s>
<s>   her mind was inevitably at liberty </s>
<s>  her thoughts could not
be chained elsewhere </s>
<s>  and the past and the future on a subject so
interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross
her memory her reflection and her fancy </s>
<s> 

from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawingtable she was
roused one morning soon after edwards leaving them by the arrival of
company </s>
<s>   she happened to be quite alone </s>
<s>   the closing of the little
gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew
her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the
door </s>
<s>   amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and <abvr> jennings
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown
to her </s>
<s>   she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john
perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open
the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the
door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one
without being heard at the other </s>
<s> 

well said he we have brought you some strangers </s>
<s>   how do you like
them </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  they will hear you </s>
<s> 

never mind if they do </s>
<s>   it is only the palmers </s>
<s>   charlotte is very
pretty i can tell you </s>
<s>   you may see her if you look this way </s>
<s> 

as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without
taking that liberty she begged to be excused </s>
<s> 

where is marianne </s>
<s>  has she run away because we are come </s>
<s>  i see her
instrument is open </s>
<s> 

she is walking i believe </s>
<s> 

they were now joined by <abvr> jennings who had not patience enough to
wait till the door was opened before she told her story </s>
<s>   she came
hallooing to the window how do you do my dear </s>
<s>   how does <abvr>
dashwood do </s>
<s>   and where are your sisters </s>
<s>   what </s>
<s>  all alone </s>
<s>  you will be
glad of a little company to sit with you </s>
<s>   i have brought my other son
and daughter to see you </s>
<s>   only think of their coming so suddenly </s>
<s>   i
thought i heard a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea
but it never entered my head that it could be them </s>
<s>   i thought of
nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again </s>
<s>  so
i said to sir john i do think i hear a carriage </s>
<s>  perhaps it is colonel
brandon come back again

elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to
receive the rest of the party </s>
<s>  lady middleton introduced the two
strangers </s>
<s>  <abvr> dashwood and margaret came down stairs at the same
time and they all sat down to look at one another while <abvr> jennings
continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour
attended by sir john </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally
unlike her in every respect </s>
<s>   she was short and plump had a very
pretty face and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be </s>
<s>   her manners were by no means so elegant as her sisters
but they were much more prepossessing </s>
<s>   she came in with a smile
smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled
when she went away </s>
<s>   her husband was a grave looking young man of five
or six and twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife
but of less willingness to please or be pleased </s>
<s>   he entered the room
with a look of selfconsequence slightly bowed to the ladies without
speaking a word and after briefly surveying them and their
apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read
it as long as he staid </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a
turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her
admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  what a delightful room this is </s>
<s>  i never saw anything so
charming </s>
<s>   only think mama how it is improved since i was here last </s>
<s> 
i always thought it such a sweet place maam </s>
<s>  turning to <abvr>
dashwood but you have made it so charming </s>
<s>   only look sister how
delightful every thing is </s>
<s>  how i should like such a house for myself </s>
<s> 
should not you <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the
newspaper </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer does not hear me said she laughing </s>
<s>  he never does
sometimes </s>
<s>   it is so ridiculous </s>
<s> 

this was quite a new idea to <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>  she had never been used to
find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with
surprise at them both </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and
continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing
their friends without ceasing till every thing was told </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every
body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an
agreeable surprise </s>
<s> 

you may believe how glad we all were to see them added <abvr>
jennings leaning forward towards elinor and speaking in a low voice
as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on
different sides of the room </s>
<s>  but however i cant help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it
for they came all round by london upon account of some business for
you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was
wrong in her situation </s>
<s>   i wanted her to stay at home and rest this
morning but she would come with us </s>
<s>  she longed so much to see you all </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm </s>
<s> 

she expects to be confined in february continued <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation and
therefore exerted herself to ask <abvr> palmer if there was any news in
the paper </s>
<s> 

no none at all he replied and read on </s>
<s> 

here comes marianne cried sir john </s>
<s>   now palmer you shall see a
monstrous pretty girl </s>
<s> 

he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and
ushered her in himself </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings asked her as soon as she
appeared if she had not been to allenham </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer laughed so
heartily at the question as to show she understood it </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
looked up on her entering the room stared at her some minutes and
then returned to his newspaper </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmers eye was now caught by
the drawings which hung round the room </s>
<s>   she got up to examine them </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear how beautiful these are </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  how delightful </s>
<s>   do but
look mama how sweet </s>
<s>  i declare they are quite charming </s>
<s>  i could look
at them for ever </s>
<s>  and then sitting down again she very soon forgot
that there were any such things in the room </s>
<s> 

when lady middleton rose to go away <abvr> palmer rose also laid down
the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all around </s>
<s> 

my love have you been asleep </s>
<s>  said his wife laughing </s>
<s> 

he made her no answer </s>
<s>  and only observed after again examining the
room that it was very low pitched and that the ceiling was crooked </s>
<s> 
he then made his bow and departed with the rest </s>
<s> 

sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
the park </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood who did not chuse to dine with them oftener
than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account </s>
<s> 
her daughters might do as they pleased </s>
<s>   but they had no curiosity to
see how <abvr> and <abvr> palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of
pleasure from them in any other way </s>
<s>   they attempted therefore
likewise to excuse themselves </s>
<s>  the weather was uncertain and not
likely to be good </s>
<s>   but sir john would not be satisfiedthe carriage
should be sent for them and they must come </s>
<s>   lady middleton too though
she did not press their mother pressed them </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings and <abvr>
palmer joined their entreaties all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
family party </s>
<s>  and the young ladies were obliged to yield </s>
<s> 

why should they ask us </s>
<s>  said marianne as soon as they were gone </s>
<s> 
the rent of this cottage is said to be low </s>
<s>  but we have it on very
hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
either with them or with us </s>
<s> 

they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now said elinor by
these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a
few weeks ago </s>
<s>   the alteration is not in them if their parties are
grown tedious and dull </s>

chapter 


as the miss dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park the next
day at one door <abvr> palmer came running in at the other looking as
good humoured and merry as before </s>
<s>   she took them all most
affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them
again </s>
<s> 

i am so glad to see you </s>
<s>  said she seating herself between elinor and
marianne for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come
which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow </s>
<s>  we must
go for the westons come to us next week you know </s>
<s>   it was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door and then <abvr> palmer asked me if i
would go with him to barton </s>
<s>   he is so droll </s>
<s>  he never tells me any
thing </s>
<s>  i am so sorry we cannot stay longer </s>
<s>  however we shall meet again
in town very soon i hope </s>
<s> 

they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation </s>
<s> 

not go to town </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> palmer with a laugh i shall be quite
disappointed if you do not </s>
<s>   i could get the nicest house in the world for
you next door to ours in hanoversquare </s>
<s>   you must come indeed </s>
<s>   i
am sure i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till i am
confined if <abvr> dashwood should not like to go into public </s>
<s> 

they thanked her </s>
<s>  but were obliged to resist all her entreaties </s>
<s> 

oh my love cried <abvr> palmer to her husband who just then entered
the roomyou must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to
town this winter </s>
<s> 

her love made no answer </s>
<s>  and after slightly bowing to the ladies began
complaining of the weather </s>
<s> 

how horrid all this is </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>   such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting </s>
<s>   dullness is as much produced within doors as
without by rain </s>
<s>   it makes one detest all ones acquaintance </s>
<s>   what
the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his
house </s>
<s>   how few people know what comfort is </s>
<s>   sir john is as stupid as
the weather </s>
<s> 

the rest of the company soon dropt in </s>
<s> 

i am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have not been able to
take your usual walk to allenham today </s>
<s> 

marianne looked very grave and said nothing </s>
<s> 

oh dont be so sly before us said <abvr> palmer </s>
<s>  for we know all
about it i assure you </s>
<s>  and i admire your taste very much for i think
he is extremely handsome </s>
<s>   we do not live a great way from him in the
country you know </s>
<s>   not above ten miles i dare say </s>
<s> 

much nearer thirty said her husband </s>
<s> 

ah well </s>
<s>  there is not much difference </s>
<s>   i never was at his house </s>
<s>  but
they say it is a sweet pretty place </s>
<s> 

as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life said <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her
interest in what was said </s>
<s> 

is it very ugly </s>
<s>  continued <abvr> palmerthen it must be some other
place that is so pretty i suppose </s>
<s> 

when they were seated in the dining room sir john observed with regret
that they were only eight all together </s>
<s> 

my dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be
so few </s>
<s>   why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today </s>
<s> 

did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before
that it could not be done </s>
<s>   they dined with us last </s>
<s> 

you and i sir john said <abvr> jennings should not stand upon such
ceremony </s>
<s> 

then you would be very illbred cried <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual
laugh </s>
<s>   do you know that you are quite rude </s>
<s> 

i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother
illbred </s>
<s> 

ay you may abuse me as you please said the goodnatured old lady
you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again </s>
<s> 
so there i have the whip hand of you </s>
<s> 

charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid
of her </s>
<s>  and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her
as they must live together </s>
<s>   it was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy than <abvr>
palmer </s>
<s>   the studied indifference insolence and discontent of her
husband gave her no pain </s>
<s>  and when he scolded or abused her she was
highly diverted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer is so droll </s>
<s>  said she in a whisper to elinor </s>
<s>   he is
always out of humour </s>
<s> 

elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly illnatured or illbred as he
wished to appear </s>
<s>   his temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly
womanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it </s>
<s>  it was rather a wish of
distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of
every body and his general abuse of every thing before him </s>
<s>   it was
the desire of appearing superior to other people </s>
<s>   the motive was too
common to be wondered at </s>
<s>  but the means however they might succeed by
establishing his superiority in illbreeding were not likely to attach
any one to him except his wife </s>
<s> 

oh my dear miss dashwood said <abvr> palmer soon afterwards i have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister </s>
<s>   will you come and
spend some time at cleveland this christmas </s>
<s>   now pray doand come
while the westons are with us </s>
<s>   you cannot think how happy i shall be </s>
<s> 
it will be quite delightful </s>
<s> my love applying to her husband dont
you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland </s>
<s> 

certainly he replied with a sneeri came into devonshire with no
other view </s>
<s> 

there nowsaid his lady you see <abvr> palmer expects you </s>
<s>  so you
cannot refuse to come </s>
<s> 

they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation </s>
<s> 

but indeed you must and shall come </s>
<s>   i am sure you will like it of all
things </s>
<s>   the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful </s>
<s> 
you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is </s>
<s>  and we are so gay
now for <abvr> palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election </s>
<s>  and so many people came to dine with us that i
never saw before it is quite charming </s>
<s>   but poor fellow </s>
<s>  it is very
fatiguing to him </s>
<s>  for he is forced to make every body like him </s>
<s> 

elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the
hardship of such an obligation </s>
<s> 

how charming it will be said charlotte when he is in
parliament </s>
<s> wont it </s>
<s>  how i shall laugh </s>
<s>   it will be so ridiculous to
see all his letters directed to him with an m </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> but do you know he
says he will never frank for me </s>
<s>   he declares he wont </s>
<s>   dont you
mr </s>
<s>  palmer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer took no notice of her </s>
<s> 

he cannot bear writing you know she continuedhe says it is quite
shocking </s>
<s> 

no said he i never said any thing so irrational </s>
<s>   dont palm all
your abuses of languages upon me </s>
<s> 

there now </s>
<s>  you see how droll he is </s>
<s>   this is always the way with him </s>
<s> 
sometimes he wont speak to me for half a day together and then he
comes out with something so drollall about any thing in the world </s>
<s> 

she surprised elinor very much as they returned into the drawingroom
by asking her whether she did not like <abvr> palmer excessively </s>
<s> 

certainly said elinor </s>
<s>  he seems very agreeable </s>
<s> 

welli am so glad you do </s>
<s>   i thought you would he is so pleasant </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can
tell you and you cant think how disappointed he will be if you dont
come to cleveland </s>
<s> i cant imagine why you should object to it </s>
<s> 

elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation </s>
<s>  and by changing the
subject put a stop to her entreaties </s>
<s>   she thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county <abvr> palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of willoughbys general character than could
be gathered from the middletons partial acquaintance with him </s>
<s>  and she
was eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from marianne </s>
<s>   she began by
inquiring if they saw much of <abvr> willoughby at cleveland and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him </s>
<s> 

oh dear yes </s>
<s>  i know him extremely well replied <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> not
that i ever spoke to him indeed </s>
<s>  but i have seen him for ever in town </s>
<s> 
somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was
at allenham </s>
<s>   mama saw him here once before </s>
<s> but i was with my uncle
at weymouth </s>
<s>   however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of
him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we
should never have been in the country together </s>

well </s>

my dear <abvr> palmer </s>

you surprise me very much </s>

you must be mistaken </s>

it happened </s>
<s>   when we met him he turned back and walked with us </s>

so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and

mrs </s>

chapter 


the palmers returned to cleveland the next day and the two families at
barton were again left to entertain each other </s>
<s>   but this did not last
long </s>
<s>  elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head had
hardly done wondering at charlottes being so happy without a cause at
mr </s>
<s>  palmers acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange
unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir
johns and <abvr> jenningss active zeal in the cause of society
procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe </s>
<s> 

in a mornings excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladies
whom <abvr> jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her
relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to
the park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over </s>
<s> 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an
invitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the
return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a
visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose
elegancewhose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof </s>
<s>  for
the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
nothing at all </s>
<s>   their being her relations too made it so much the
worse </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jenningss attempts at consolation were therefore
unfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not to care about
their being so fashionable </s>
<s>  because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another </s>
<s>   as it was impossible however now to prevent
their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it with
all the philosophy of a wellbred woman contenting herself with merely
giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times
every day </s>
<s> 

the young ladies arrived </s>
<s>  their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
unfashionable </s>
<s>   their dress was very smart their manners very civil
they were delighted with the house and in raptures with the furniture
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that lady
middletons good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
been an hour at the park </s>
<s>   she declared them to be very agreeable girls
indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration </s>
<s>   sir johns
confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he
set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss
steeles arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world </s>
<s>   from such commendation as this however there was not
much to be learned </s>
<s>  elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
world were to be met with in every part of england under every
possible variation of form face temper and understanding </s>
<s>   sir john
wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his
guests </s>
<s>   benevolent philanthropic man </s>
<s>   it was painful to him even to
keep a third cousin to himself </s>
<s> 

do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare you shall
comeyou cant think how you will like them </s>
<s>   lucy is monstrous
pretty and so good humoured and agreeable </s>
<s>   the children are all
hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance </s>
<s>   and they
both long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter that
you are the most beautiful creatures in the world </s>
<s>  and i have told them
it is all very true and a great deal more </s>
<s>   you will be delighted with
them i am sure </s>
<s>   they have brought the whole coach full of playthings
for the children </s>
<s>   how can you be so cross as not to come </s>
<s>   why they
are your cousins you know after a fashion </s>
<s>   you are my cousins and
they are my wifes so you must be related </s>
<s> 

but sir john could not prevail </s>
<s>   he could only obtain a promise of
their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in
amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their
attractions to the miss steeles as he had been already boasting of the
miss steeles to them </s>
<s> 

when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place they found in the appearance of the
eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible
face nothing to admire </s>
<s>  but in the other who was not more than two or
three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty </s>
<s>  her features
were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of air
which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction
to her person </s>
<s>  their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what
constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
to lady middleton </s>
<s>   with her children they were in continual raptures
extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their
whims </s>
<s>  and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of
whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing
or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her
appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight </s>
<s> 
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fond
mother though in pursuit of praise for her children the most
rapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous </s>
<s>  her demands
are exorbitant </s>
<s>  but she will swallow any thing </s>
<s>  and the excessive
affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring were
viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise or
distrust </s>
<s>   she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted </s>
<s> 
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their
workbags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and felt
no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment </s>
<s>   it suggested no other
surprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by
without claiming a share in what was passing </s>
<s> 

john is in such spirits today </s>
<s>  said she on his taking miss steeless
pocket handkerchief and throwing it out of windowhe is full of
monkey tricks </s>
<s> 

and soon afterwards on the second boys violently pinching one of the
same ladys fingers she fondly observed how playful william is </s>
<s> 

and here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressing
a little girl of three years old who had not made a noise for the last
two minutes </s>
<s>  and she is always so gentle and quietnever was there
such a quiet little thing </s>
<s> 

but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces a pin in her ladyships
head dress slightly scratching the childs neck produced from this
pattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone
by any creature professedly noisy </s>
<s>   the mothers consternation was
excessive </s>
<s>  but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles and
every thing was done by all three in so critical an emergency which
affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
sufferer </s>
<s>   she was seated in her mothers lap covered with kisses her
wound bathed with lavenderwater by one of the miss steeles who was
on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
the other </s>
<s>   with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to
cease crying </s>
<s>   she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two
brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were
ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been
successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of
screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that
it would not be rejected </s>
<s>  she was carried out of the room therefore
in her mothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys
chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
had not known for many hours </s>
<s> 

poor little creatures </s>
<s>  said miss steele as soon as they were gone </s>
<s> 
it might have been a very sad accident </s>
<s> 

yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it had been under
totally different circumstances </s>
<s>   but this is the usual way of
heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality </s>
<s> 

what a sweet woman lady middleton is </s>
<s>  said lucy steele </s>
<s> 

marianne was silent </s>
<s>  it was impossible for her to say what she did not
feel however trivial the occasion </s>
<s>  and upon elinor therefore the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell </s>
<s>   she did
her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more
warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy </s>
<s> 

and sir john too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is </s>
<s> 

here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple and just
came in without any eclat </s>
<s>   she merely observed that he was perfectly
good humoured and friendly </s>
<s> 

and what a charming little family they have </s>
<s>   i never saw such fine
children in my life </s>
<s> i declare i quite doat upon them already and
indeed i am always distractedly fond of children </s>
<s> 

i should guess so said elinor with a smile from what i have
witnessed this morning </s>
<s> 

i have a notion said lucy you think the little middletons rather
too much indulged </s>
<s>  perhaps they may be the outside of enough </s>
<s>  but it is
so natural in lady middleton </s>
<s>  and for my part i love to see children
full of life and spirits </s>
<s>  i cannot bear them if they are tame and
quiet </s>
<s> 

i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence </s>
<s> 

a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by miss
steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who now
said rather abruptly and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood </s>
<s> 
i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex </s>
<s> 

in some surprise at the familiarity of this question or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken elinor replied that she was </s>
<s> 

norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it </s>
<s>  added miss steele </s>
<s> 

we have heard sir john admire it excessively said lucy who seemed
to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister </s>
<s> 

i think every one must admire it replied elinor who ever saw the
place </s>
<s>  though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
beauties as we do </s>
<s> 

and had you a great many smart beaux there </s>
<s>   i suppose you have not so
many in this part of the world </s>
<s>  for my part i think they are a vast
addition always </s>
<s> 

but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed of her sister
that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex </s>
<s> 

nay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there ant </s>
<s>   im
sure theres a vast many smart beaux in exeter </s>
<s>  but you know how could
i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland </s>
<s>  and i was only
afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not
so many as they used to have </s>
<s>   but perhaps you young ladies may not
care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them </s>
<s> 
for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress
smart and behave civil </s>
<s>   but i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty </s>
<s> 
now theres <abvr> rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite a
beau clerk to <abvr> simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him of
a morning he is not fit to be seen </s>
<s>  i suppose your brother was quite
a beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich </s>
<s> 

upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you for i do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word </s>
<s>   but this i can say that
if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear </s>
<s>  one never thinks of married mens being beauxthey have
something else to do </s>
<s> 

lord </s>
<s>  anne cried her sister you can talk of nothing but
beaux </s>
<s> you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else </s>
<s> 
and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and the
furniture </s>
<s> 

this specimen of the miss steeles was enough </s>
<s>   the vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her no recommendation and as elinor was not
blinded by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest to her want
of real elegance and artlessness she left the house without any wish
of knowing them better </s>
<s> 

not so the miss steeles </s>
<s> they came from exeter well provided with
admiration for the use of sir john middleton his family and all his
relations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair
cousins whom they declared to be the most beautiful elegant
accomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted </s>
<s>  and to be
better acquainted therefore elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot for as sir john was entirely on the side of the miss steeles
their party would be too strong for opposition and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two
together in the same room almost every day </s>
<s>   sir john could do no more </s>
<s> 
but he did not know that any more was required </s>
<s>  to be together was in
his opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established
friends </s>
<s> 

to do him justice he did every thing in his power to promote their
unreserve by making the miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knew
or supposed of his cousins situations in the most delicate
particularsand elinor had not seen them more than twice before the
eldest of them wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to barton </s>
<s> 

twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure said
she and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome </s>
<s>   and i
hope you may have as good luck yourself soonbut perhaps you may have
a friend in the corner already </s>
<s> 

elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in
proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward than he had been
with respect to marianne </s>
<s>  indeed it was rather his favourite joke of
the two as being somewhat newer and more conjectural </s>
<s>  and since
edwards visit they had never dined together without his drinking to
her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks as to excite general attention </s>
<s>   the letter fhad been likewise
invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless
jokes that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with elinor </s>
<s> 

the miss steeles as she expected had now all the benefit of these
jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently
expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family </s>
<s>   but sir john did not sport long
with the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least as
much pleasure in telling the name as miss steele had in hearing it </s>
<s> 

his name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper </s>
<s>  but pray do
not tell it for its a great secret </s>
<s> 

ferrars </s>
<s>  repeated miss steele </s>
<s>  <abvr> ferrars is the happy man is he </s>
<s> 
what </s>
<s>  your sisterinlaws brother miss dashwood </s>
<s>  a very agreeable
young man to be sure </s>
<s>  i know him very well </s>
<s> 

how can you say so anne </s>
<s>  cried lucy who generally made an amendment
to all her sisters assertions </s>
<s>   though we have seen him once or twice
at my uncles it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well </s>
<s> 

elinor heard all this with attention and surprise </s>
<s>   and who was this
uncle </s>
<s>   where did he live </s>
<s>   how came they acquainted </s>
<s>   she wished very
much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in
it herself </s>
<s>  but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in
her life she thought <abvr> jennings deficient either in curiosity after
petty information or in a disposition to communicate it </s>
<s>   the manner
in which miss steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity </s>
<s>  for
it struck her as being rather illnatured and suggested the suspicion
of that ladys knowing or fancying herself to know something to his
disadvantage </s>
<s> but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice
was taken of <abvr> ferrarss name by miss steele when alluded to or even
openly mentioned by sir john </s>

chapter 


marianne who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference of
taste from herself was at this time particularly illdisposed from
the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles or to
encourage their advances </s>
<s>  and to the invariable coldness of her
behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of
lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her sentiments </s>
<s> 

lucy was naturally clever </s>
<s>  her remarks were often just and amusing </s>
<s>  and
as a companion for half an hour elinor frequently found her agreeable </s>
<s> 
but her powers had received no aid from education </s>
<s>  she was ignorant and
illiterate </s>
<s>  and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of
information in the most common particulars could not be concealed from
miss dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to
advantage </s>
<s>   elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable </s>
<s>  but she saw with
less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of
rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her
assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed </s>
<s>  and she could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance </s>
<s>  whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made
every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless </s>
<s> 

you will think my question an odd one i dare say said lucy to her
one day as they were walking together from the park to the
cottagebut pray are you personally acquainted with your
sisterinlaws mother <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

elinor did think the question a very odd one and her countenance
expressed it as she answered that she had never seen <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  replied lucy </s>
<s>  i wonder at that for i thought you must have
seen her at norland sometimes </s>
<s>   then perhaps you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she is </s>
<s> 

no returned elinor cautious of giving her real opinion of edwards
mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity i know nothing of her </s>
<s> 

i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a
way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke </s>
<s>  but perhaps
there may be reasonsi wish i might venture </s>
<s>  but however i hope you
will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be
impertinent </s>
<s> 

elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence </s>
<s>   it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by
saying with some hesitation

i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious </s>
<s>   i am sure i
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours </s>
<s>   and i am sure i
should not have the smallest fear of trusting you </s>
<s>  indeed i should be
very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
situation as i am </s>
<s>  but however there is no occasion to trouble you </s>
<s> 
i am sorry you do not happen to know <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment if it could
be of any use to you to know my opinion of her </s>
<s>   but really i never
understood that you were at all connected with that family and
therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry
into her character </s>
<s> 

i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it </s>
<s>   but
if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised </s>
<s>   <abvr>
ferrars is certainly nothing to me at presentbut the time may
comehow soon it will come must depend upon herselfwhen we may be
very intimately connected </s>
<s> 

she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side
glance at her companion to observe its effect on her </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elinor what do you mean </s>
<s>   are you acquainted
with <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s>   can you be </s>
<s>  and she did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sisterinlaw </s>
<s> 

no replied lucy not to <abvr> robert ferrarsi never saw him in my
life </s>
<s>  but fixing her eyes upon elinor to his eldest brother </s>
<s> 

what felt elinor at that moment </s>
<s>  astonishment that would have been as
painful as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it </s>
<s>   she turned towards lucy in silent amazement
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration </s>
<s>  and though
her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon </s>
<s> 

you may well be surprised continued lucy </s>
<s>  for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before </s>
<s>  for i dare say he never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family </s>
<s>  because it was always
meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so
by me to this hour </s>
<s>   not a soul of all my relations know of it but
anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt
the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy </s>

thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about <abvr> ferrars
must seem so odd that it ought to be explained </s>
<s>   and i do not think
mr </s>
<s>  ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you
because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your
family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as
his own sisters </s>
<s> she paused </s>
<s> 

elinor for a few moments remained silent </s>
<s>   her astonishment at what she
heard was at first too great for words </s>
<s>  but at length forcing herself
to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude may i ask
if your engagement is of long standing </s>
<s> 

we have been engaged these four years </s>
<s> 

four years </s>
<s> 

yes </s>

elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it </s>

i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the
other day </s>

your uncle </s>

yes </s>
<s>  <abvr> pratt </s>
<s>   did you never hear him talk of <abvr> pratt </s>

i think i have replied elinor with an exertion of spirits which
increased with her increase of emotion </s>
<s> 

he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near
plymouth </s>
<s>   it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and me
was often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement was
formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil </s>
<s>  but he
was almost always with us afterwards </s>
<s>   i was very unwilling to enter
into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of
his mother </s>
<s>  but i was too young and loved him too well to be so
prudent as i ought to have been </s>
<s>  though you do not know him so well

of person or name </s>

all my happiness depends </s>

it is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity that i
should never have heard him even mention your name </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  considering our situation it was not strange </s>
<s>   our first care has
been to keep the matter secret </s>
<s>  you knew nothing of me or my family
and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name

suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it </s>

she was silent </s>

instantly acknowledging the likeness </s>

i have never been able continued lucy to give him my picture in

anxious to get it </s>
<s>   but i am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity </s>
<s> 

you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly </s>
<s>   they then
proceeded a few paces in silence </s>
<s>   lucy spoke first </s>
<s> 

i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to
us not to have it reach his mother </s>
<s>  for she would never approve of it
i dare say </s>
<s>   i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding
proud woman </s>
<s> 

i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor </s>

no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on </s>
<s>   your
secret is safe with me </s>
<s>  but pardon me if i express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication </s>
<s>   you must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety </s>
<s> 

as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover
something in her countenance </s>
<s>  perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she had been saying </s>
<s>  but lucys countenance suffered no
change </s>
<s> 

i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you

<s>   i have not known you long to be
sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by
description a great while </s>

inquiries about edwards mother </s>

not a creature whose advice i can ask </s>
<s>   anne is the only person that
knows of it and she has no judgment at all </s>
<s>  indeed she does me a
great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her
betraying me </s>
<s>   she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must
perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world

mind from it altogether </s>
<s>   i only wonder that i am alive after what i

<s>   every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty </s>
<s>  and seeing him so seldomwe can hardly

here she took out her handkerchief </s>

compassionate </s>
<s> 

sometimes </s>
<s>  continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether it
would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely </s>
<s>   as
she said this she looked directly at her companion </s>
<s>   but then at
other times i have not resolution enough for it </s>

such a case miss dashwood </s>

<s> 

pardon me replied elinor startled by the question </s>

you no advice under such circumstances </s>
<s>   your own judgment must direct
you </s>

to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on both
sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other </s>

oh yes </s>

<s>   did you think he
came directly from town </s>

no replied elinor most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of lucys veracity </s>
<s>  i remember he told us that
he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth </s>

remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing
farther of those friends at his total silence with respect even to
their names </s>
<s> 

did not you think him sadly out of spirits </s>
<s>  repeated lucy </s>
<s> 

we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived </s>
<s> 

i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
matter </s>
<s>  but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than
a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected </s>
<s>  poor fellow </s>
<s> i
am afraid it is just the same with him now </s>
<s>  for he writes in wretched
spirits </s>
<s>   i heard from him just before i left exeter </s>
<s>  taking a letter
from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor </s>
<s>   you
know his hand i dare say a charming one it is </s>
<s>  but that is not
written so well as usual </s>
<s> he was tired i dare say for he had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible </s>
<s> 

elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer </s>
<s>   this
picture she had allowed herself to believe might have been
accidentally obtained </s>
<s>  it might not have been edwards gift </s>
<s>  but a
correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a
positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else </s>
<s>  for a few
moments she was almost overcomeher heart sunk within her and she
could hardly stand </s>
<s>  but exertion was indispensably necessary </s>
<s>  and she
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that
her success was speedy and for the time complete </s>
<s> 

writing to each other said lucy returning the letter into her
pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations </s>
<s>   yes i
have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even
that </s>
<s>   if he had but my picture he says he should be easy </s>
<s>   i gave him
a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and
that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture </s>
<s> 
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him </s>
<s> 

i did said elinor with a composure of voice under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt
before </s>
<s>   she was mortified shocked confounded </s>

fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the
conversation could be continued no farther </s>

however small elinors general dependence on lucys veracity might be
it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the

miss steeles as to norland and their family connections which had
often surprised her the picture the letter the ring formed
altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of
condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality
could set aside his illtreatment of herself </s>
<s> her resentment of such
behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short time
made her feel only for herself </s>

soon arose </s>

feigned a regard for her which he did not feel </s>
<s>   was his engagement to
lucy an engagement of the heart </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  whatever it might once have been
she could not believe it such at present </s>
<s>   his affection was all her
own </s>
<s>   she could not be deceived in that </s>
<s>   her mother sisters fanny
all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland </s>
<s>  it was not an
illusion of her own vanity </s>
<s>   he certainly loved her </s>
<s>   what a softener
of the heart was this persuasion </s>
<s>   how much could it not tempt her to
forgive </s>
<s>   he had been blamable highly blamable in remaining at
norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it
ought to be </s>
<s>   in that he could not be defended </s>
<s>  but if he had injured
her how much more had he injured himself </s>
<s>  if her case were pitiable
his was hopeless </s>
<s>   his imprudence had made her miserable for a while </s>
<s> 
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
otherwise </s>
<s>   she might in time regain tranquillity </s>
<s>  but he what had he
to look forward to </s>
<s>   could he ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele </s>
<s> 
could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his
integrity his delicacy and wellinformed mind be satisfied with a
wife like herilliterate artful and selfish </s>
<s> 

the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every
thing but her beauty and good nature </s>
<s>  but the four succeeding
yearsyears which if rationally spent give such improvement to the
understanding must have opened his eyes to her defects of education
while the same period of time spent on her side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty </s>
<s> 

if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties
from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely
to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself </s>
<s>   these
difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not
press very hard upon his patience </s>
<s>  but melancholy was the state of the
person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness
could be felt as a relief </s>
<s> 

as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept
for him more than for herself </s>
<s>   supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her present unhappiness and consoled by the
belief that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought
she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother
and sisters </s>
<s>   and so well was she able to answer her own expectations
that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first
suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object
of her love and that marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly
possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house </s>
<s> 

the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing
exertion was no aggravation of elinors distress </s>
<s>   on the contrary it
was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of edward which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt
equal to support </s>
<s> 

from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive
no assistance their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress
while her selfcommand would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise </s>
<s>   she was stronger alone and her own
good sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken
her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so
poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be </s>
<s> 

much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the
subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it </s>
<s>  and this for
more reasons than one </s>
<s>   she wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what
lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her
declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to
convince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her
calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary
agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least
doubtful </s>
<s>   that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
probable </s>
<s>  it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in her
praise not merely from lucys assertion but from her venturing to
trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important </s>
<s>   and even sir johns joking
intelligence must have had some weight </s>
<s>   but indeed while elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that lucy should be jealous </s>
<s>  and that she was so her very
confidence was a proof </s>
<s>   what other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be but that elinor might be informed by it of
lucys superior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him in future </s>
<s> 
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals
intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every
principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection
for edward and to see him as little as possible </s>
<s>  she could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was
unwounded </s>
<s>   and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure </s>
<s> 

but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred </s>
<s>  for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others </s>
<s>  and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage and chiefly at
the former they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation </s>
<s>   such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady
middletons head </s>
<s>  and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
a general chat and none at all for particular discourse </s>
<s>   they met for
the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards
or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy </s>
<s> 

one or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affording
elinor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at
the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they
would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged to
attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be quite alone
except her mother and the two miss steeles </s>
<s>   elinor who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this
was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and wellbred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united
them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the
invitation </s>
<s>  margaret with her mothers permission was equally
compliant and marianne though always unwilling to join any of their
parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her
seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise </s>
<s> 

the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her </s>
<s>   the insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as elinor had expected </s>
<s>  it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room </s>
<s>  to the latter the children accompanied them and while
they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging lucys attention to attempt it </s>
<s>   they quitted it only with the
removal of the teathings </s>
<s>   the cardtable was then placed and elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park </s>
<s>   they all rose up in
preparation for a round game </s>
<s> 

i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to finish
poor little annamarias basket this evening </s>
<s>  for i am sure it must hurt
your eyes to work filigree by candlelight </s>
<s>   and we will make the dear
little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then i
hope she will not much mind it </s>
<s> 

this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly and replied
indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton </s>
<s>  i am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have
been at my filigree already </s>
<s>   i would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world </s>
<s>  and if you want me at the cardtable now i am
resolved to finish the basket after supper </s>
<s> 

you are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyeswill you ring the
bell for some working candles </s>
<s>   my poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for
though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon
having it done </s>
<s> 

lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an
alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no
greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child </s>
<s> 

lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others </s>
<s>   no one made
any objection but marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms
of general civility exclaimed your ladyship will have the goodness
to excuse meyou know i detest cards </s>
<s>   i shall go to the pianoforte </s>
<s> 
i have not touched it since it was tuned </s>
<s>   and without farther
ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument </s>
<s> 

lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made
so rude a speech </s>
<s> 

marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know maam
said elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence </s>
<s>  and i do not
much wonder at it </s>
<s>  for it is the very best toned pianoforte i ever
heard </s>
<s> 

the remaining five were now to draw their cards </s>
<s> 

perhaps continued elinor if i should happen to cut out i may be
of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her </s>
<s>  and
there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be
impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening </s>
<s>   i
should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it </s>
<s> 

indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucy
for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was </s>
<s> 
and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after
all </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  that would be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little
soul how i do love her </s>
<s> 

you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor </s>
<s>  and as you really
like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber or will you take your chance now </s>
<s> 

elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a
little of that address which marianne could never condescend to
practise gained her own end and pleased lady middleton at the same
time </s>
<s>   lucy made room for her with ready attention and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table and with the
utmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work </s>
<s>   the pianoforte at
which marianne wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself
was luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might
safely under the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting
subject without any risk of being heard at the cardtable </s>

i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with

subject </s>
<s>   i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again </s>
<s> 

thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking the ice </s>
<s>  you have set my
heart at ease by it </s>
<s>  for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended
you by what i told you that monday </s>
<s> 

offended me </s>
<s>  how could you suppose so </s>
<s>  believe me and elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea </s>
<s>   could you have a motive for
the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me </s>
<s> 

and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sharp eyes full of
meaning there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
manner that made me quite uncomfortable </s>
<s>   i felt sure that you was
angry with me </s>
<s>  and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for
having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs </s>
<s>   but i am
very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not
blame me </s>
<s>   if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of
my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am
sure </s>
<s> 

indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you
to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall
never have reason to repent it </s>
<s>   your case is a very unfortunate one </s>
<s> 
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have
need of all your mutual affection to support you under them </s>

ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother </s>
<s> 

he has only two thousand pounds of his own </s>
<s>  it would be madness to
marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect
of more without a sigh </s>
<s>   i have been always used to a very small
income and could struggle with any poverty for him </s>
<s>  but i love him too
well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his
mother might give him if he married to please her </s>
<s>   we must wait it
may be for many years </s>
<s>   with almost every other man in the world it
would be an alarming prospect </s>
<s>  but edwards affection and constancy
nothing can deprive me of i know </s>
<s> 

that conviction must be every thing to you </s>
<s>  and he is undoubtedly
supported by the same trust in yours </s>
<s>   if the strength of your
reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under
many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement
your situation would have been pitiable indeed </s>
<s> 

lucy here looked up </s>
<s>  but elinor was careful in guarding her countenance
from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency </s>
<s> 

edwards love for me said lucy has been pretty well put to the
test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and
it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt
it now </s>
<s>   i can safely say that he has never gave me one moments alarm
on that account from the first </s>
<s> 

elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion </s>
<s> 

lucy went on </s>
<s>   i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from
our different situations in life from his being so much more in the
world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for
suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any
lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked
more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at
longstaple than he used to be </s>
<s>   i do not mean to say that i am
particularly observant or quicksighted in general but in such a case
i am sure i could not be deceived </s>
<s> 

all this thought elinor is very pretty </s>
<s>  but it can impose upon
neither of us </s>
<s> 

but what said she after a short silence are your views </s>
<s>  or have
you none but that of waiting for <abvr> ferrarss death which is a
melancholy and shocking extremity </s>
<s> is her son determined to submit to
this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which
it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a
while by owning the truth </s>
<s> 

if we could be certain that it would be only for a while </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger
upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and
the idea of that for edwards sake frightens away all my inclination
for hasty measures </s>
<s> 

and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness
beyond reason </s>
<s> 

lucy looked at elinor again and was silent </s>
<s> 

do you know <abvr> robert ferrars </s>

not at alli never saw him </s>

words by a sudden pause in mariannes music </s>
<s>  oh they are talking of

<s> 

no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beaux
are not great coxcombs </s>
<s> 

i can answer for it that miss dashwoods is not said <abvr> jennings

<s>  for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved
young men i ever saw </s>
<s>  but as for lucy she is such a sly little
creature there is no finding out who she likes </s>

oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i dare
say lucys beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss
dashwoods </s>
<s> 

elinor blushed in spite of herself </s>
<s>   lucy bit her lip and looked
angrily at her sister </s>
<s>   a mutual silence took place for some time </s>
<s> 
lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marianne
was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto

i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
head for bringing matters to bear </s>
<s>  indeed i am bound to let you into
the secret for you are a party concerned </s>
<s>   i dare say you have seen
enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other
profession </s>

can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind
enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard
to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living </s>
<s> 
which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not
likely to live a great while </s>
<s>   that would be enough for us to marry
upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest </s>
<s> 

i should always be happy replied elinor to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for <abvr> ferrars </s>

interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary </s>

orders </s>
<s> 

then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little </s>
<s> 

they were again silent for many minutes </s>
<s>   at length lucy exclaimed with
a deep sigh

i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
once by dissolving the engagement </s>
<s>   we seem so beset with difficulties
on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we
should be happier perhaps in the end </s>
<s>   but you will not give me your
advice miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

no answered elinor with a smile which concealed very agitated
feelings on such a subject i certainly will not </s>
<s>   you know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the
side of your wishes </s>
<s> 

indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great solemnity </s>
<s>  i know
nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours </s>
<s>  and i do
really believe that if you was to say to me i advise you by all
means to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars it will be
more for the happiness of both of you i should resolve upon doing it
immediately </s>
<s> 

elinor blushed for the insincerity of edwards future wife and
replied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
opinion on the subject had i formed one </s>
<s>   it raises my influence much
too high </s>
<s>  the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
much for an indifferent person </s>
<s> 

tis because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some
pique and laying a particular stress on those words that your
judgment might justly have such weight with me </s>
<s>   if you could be
supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion
would not be worth having </s>
<s> 

elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve </s>
<s>  and
was even partly determined never to mention the subject again </s>
<s>   another
pause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech and
lucy was still the first to end it </s>
<s> 

shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood </s>
<s>  said she with all
her accustomary complacency </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s> 

i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at
the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
there </s>
<s>   but i dare say you will go for all that </s>
<s>   to be sure your
brother and sister will ask you to come to them </s>
<s> 

it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do </s>
<s> 

how unlucky that is </s>
<s>  i had quite depended upon meeting you there </s>
<s> 
anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who
have been wanting us to visit them these several years </s>
<s>   but i only go
for the sake of seeing edward </s>
<s>   he will be there in february otherwise
london would have no charms for me </s>
<s>  i have not spirits for it </s>
<s> 

elinor was soon called to the cardtable by the conclusion of the first
rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for
nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
less than they had done before </s>
<s>  and elinor sat down to the card table
with the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without
affection for the person who was to be his wife </s>
<s>  but that he had not
even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere
affection on her side would have given for selfinterest alone could
induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed so
thoroughly aware that he was weary </s>
<s> 

from this time the subject was never revived by elinor and when
entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it
and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness
whenever she received a letter from edward it was treated by the
former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility
would allow </s>
<s>  for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself </s>
<s> 

the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyond
what the first invitation implied </s>
<s>   their favour increased </s>
<s>  they could
not be spared </s>
<s>  sir john would not hear of their going </s>
<s>  and in spite of
their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter in spite of the
absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was
in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay
nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration of
that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private
balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance </s>

chapter 


though <abvr> jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her children and friends she was not without
a settled habitation of her own </s>
<s>   since the death of her husband who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town she had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portman
square </s>
<s>   towards this home she began on the approach of january to
turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very
unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses dashwood to accompany her </s>
<s> 
elinor without observing the varying complexion of her sister and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations </s>
<s>   the reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings received the refusal with some surprise and
repeated her invitation immediately </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg
you will favour me with your company for ive quite set my heart upon
it </s>
<s>   dont fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i shant
put myself at all out of my way for you </s>
<s>   it will only be sending betty
by the coach and i hope i can afford that </s>
<s>   we three shall be able to
go very well in my chaise </s>
<s>  and when we are in town if you do not like
to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my
daughters </s>
<s>   i am sure your mother will not object to it </s>
<s>  for i have had
such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will
think me a very fit person to have the charge of you </s>
<s>  and if i dont
get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it
shall not be my fault </s>
<s>   i shall speak a good word for you to all the
young men you may depend upon it </s>
<s> 

i have a notion said sir john that miss marianne would not object
to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it </s>
<s>   it is very
hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss
dashwood does not wish it </s>
<s>   so i would advise you two to set off for
town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss
dashwood about it </s>
<s> 

nay cried <abvr> jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of
miss mariannes company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the
more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for
them to be together </s>
<s>  because if they got tired of me they might talk
to one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back </s>
<s>   but one or
the other if not both of them i must have </s>
<s>   lord bless me </s>
<s>  how do you
think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till
this winter to have charlotte with me </s>
<s>   come miss marianne let us
strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her
mind by and bye why so much the better </s>
<s> 

i thank you maam sincerely thank you said marianne with warmth </s>
<s> 
your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give
me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of
to be able to accept it </s>
<s>   but my mother my dearest kindest motheri
feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made
less happy less comfortable by our absenceoh </s>
<s>  no nothing should
tempt me to leave her </s>
<s>   it should not must not be a struggle </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings repeated her assurance that <abvr> dashwood could spare
them perfectly well </s>
<s>  and elinor who now understood her sister and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her
eagerness to be with willoughby again made no farther direct
opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mothers
decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any
support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not
approve of for marianne and which on her own account she had
particular reasons to avoid </s>
<s>   whatever marianne was desirous of her
mother would be eager to promoteshe could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had
never been able to inspire her with distrust </s>
<s>  and she dared not explain
the motive of her own disinclination for going to london </s>
<s>   that
marianne fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with <abvr>
jennings manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object
was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object
to her as elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to
witness </s>
<s> 

on being informed of the invitation <abvr> dashwood persuaded that such
an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her
daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to
herself how much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear of
their declining the offer upon her account </s>
<s>  insisted on their both
accepting it directly </s>
<s>  and then began to foresee with her usual
cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all
from this separation </s>
<s> 

i am delighted with the plan she cried it is exactly what i could
wish </s>
<s>   margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves </s>
<s> 
when you and the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music </s>
<s>  you will find margaret
so improved when you come back again </s>
<s>   i have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one </s>
<s>   it is very right that you should go to
town </s>
<s>  i would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of london </s>
<s>   you will be
under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to
you i can have no doubt </s>
<s>   and in all probability you will see your
brother and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife
when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so wholly
estranged from each other </s>
<s> 

though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said elinor you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion
cannot be so easily removed </s>
<s> 

mariannes countenance sunk </s>
<s> 

and what said <abvr> dashwood is my dear prudent elinor going to
suggest </s>
<s>   what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward </s>
<s>   do let
me hear a word about the expense of it </s>
<s> 

my objection is this </s>
<s>  though i think very well of <abvr> jenningss
heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or
whose protection will give us consequence </s>
<s> 

that is very true replied her mother but of her society
separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing
at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady
middleton </s>
<s> 

if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of <abvr> jennings said
marianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation </s>
<s>   i
have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort </s>
<s> 

elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty in
persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness </s>
<s>  and resolved
within herself that if her sister persisted in going she would go
likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her own judgment or that <abvr> jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of her
domestic hours </s>
<s>   to this determination she was the more easily
reconciled by recollecting that edward ferrars by lucys account was
not to be in town before february </s>
<s>  and that their visit without any
unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished </s>
<s> 

i will have you both go said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>  these objections are
nonsensical </s>
<s>   you will have much pleasure in being in london and
especially in being together </s>
<s>  and if elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of
sources </s>
<s>  she would perhaps expect some from improving her
acquaintance with her sisterinlaws family </s>
<s> 

elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her
mothers dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this
attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin
her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars
very much and shall always be glad to see him </s>
<s>  but as to the rest of
the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am
ever known to them or not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood smiled and said nothing </s>
<s>   marianne lifted up her eyes in
astonishment and elinor conjectured that she might as well have held
her tongue </s>
<s> 

after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness
and care </s>
<s>  nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her </s>
<s>   sir john was
delighted </s>
<s>  for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in
london was something </s>
<s>   even lady middleton took the trouble of being
delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way </s>
<s>  and as for
the miss steeles especially lucy they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them </s>
<s> 

elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with
less reluctance than she had expected to feel </s>
<s>   with regard to herself
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not and
when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her
sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to all
her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety she
could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence </s>
<s> 

mariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness so great was the
perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone </s>
<s>   her
unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness </s>
<s> 
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive </s>
<s> 
her mothers affliction was hardly less and elinor was the only one of
the three who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal </s>
<s> 

their departure took place in the first week in january </s>
<s>   the
middletons were to follow in about a week </s>
<s>   the miss steeles kept their
station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the
family </s>

chapter 


elinor could not find herself in the carriage with <abvr> jennings and
beginning a journey to london under her protection and as her guest
without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure
only a few days before </s>
<s>  but these objections had all with that happy
ardour of youth which marianne and her mother equally shared been
overcome or overlooked </s>
<s>  and elinor in spite of every occasional doubt
of willoughbys constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless
her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would
engage in the solicitude of mariannes situation to have the same
animating object in view the same possibility of hope </s>
<s>   a short a
very short time however must now decide what willoughbys intentions
were </s>
<s>  in all probability he was already in town </s>
<s>   mariannes eagerness
to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there </s>
<s>  and elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character
which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her
but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such
zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant
before many meetings had taken place </s>
<s>   should the result of her
observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her sister </s>
<s>  should it be otherwise her exertions would be
of a different natureshe must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction
in the happiness of marianne </s>
<s> 

they were three days on their journey and mariannes behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to <abvr> jennings might be expected to be </s>
<s>   she sat in
silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her sister </s>
<s>   to atone for this conduct therefore elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had
assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to <abvr> jennings
talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she
could </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings on her side treated them both with all
possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets </s>
<s>   they reached town by
three oclock the third day glad to be released after such a journey
from the confinement of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire </s>
<s> 

the house was handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies
were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment </s>
<s>   it
had formerly been charlottes and over the mantelpiece still hung a
landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having
spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect </s>
<s> 

as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her
mother and sat down for that purpose </s>
<s>   in a few moments marianne did
the same </s>
<s>   i am writing home marianne said elinor </s>
<s>  had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two </s>
<s> 

i am not going to write to my mother replied marianne hastily and
as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry </s>
<s>   elinor said no more </s>
<s>  it
immediately struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby </s>
<s>  and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair they must be
engaged </s>
<s>   this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her
pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity </s>
<s> 
mariannes was finished in a very few minutes </s>
<s>  in length it could be no
more than a note </s>
<s>  it was then folded up sealed and directed with
eager rapidity </s>
<s>   elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in the
direction </s>
<s>  and no sooner was it complete than marianne ringing the
bell requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her to the twopenny post </s>
<s>   this decided the matter at once </s>
<s> 

her spirits still continued very high </s>
<s>  but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on </s>
<s>   she could scarcely eat any
dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage </s>
<s> 

it was a great satisfaction to elinor that <abvr> jennings by being much
engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing </s>
<s>   the tea
things were brought in and already had marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house elinor
felt secure of its announcing willoughbys approach and marianne
starting up moved towards the door </s>
<s>   every thing was silent </s>
<s>  this
could not be borne many seconds </s>
<s>  she opened the door advanced a few
steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned
into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him would naturally produce </s>
<s>  in the ecstasy of her feelings at that
instant she could not help exclaiming oh elinor it is willoughby
indeed it is </s>
<s>  and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms
when colonel brandon appeared </s>
<s> 

it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness and she immediately
left the room </s>
<s>   elinor was disappointed too </s>
<s>  but at the same time her
regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her </s>
<s>  and she felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive
that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him </s>
<s>   she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even
observed marianne as she quitted the room with such astonishment and
concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself </s>
<s> 

is your sister ill </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of
headaches low spirits and over fatigues </s>
<s>  and of every thing to which
she could decently attribute her sisters behaviour </s>
<s> 

he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect
himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of
his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about
their journey and the friends they had left behind </s>
<s> 

in this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side
they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere </s>
<s>   elinor wished very much to ask whether
willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by
any enquiry after his rival </s>
<s>  and at length by way of saying something
she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last </s>
<s> 
yes he replied with some embarrassment almost ever since </s>
<s>  i have
been once or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never been in
my power to return to barton </s>
<s> 

this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to
her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to <abvr> jennings and she
was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the
subject than she had ever felt </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings soon came in </s>
<s>   oh </s>

noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad to see yousorry i could not

<s>   well colonel i have brought two

<s>   but colonel where have you
been to since we parted </s>
<s>   and how does your business go on </s>
<s>   come
come lets have no secrets among friends </s>
<s> 

he replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries but
without satisfying her in any </s>
<s>   elinor now began to make the tea and
marianne was obliged to appear again </s>
<s> 

after her entrance colonel brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he had been before and <abvr> jennings could not prevail on him to
stay long </s>
<s>   no other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed </s>
<s> 

marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks </s>
<s> 
the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day </s>
<s>   they had not long finished
their breakfast before <abvr> palmers barouche stopped at the door and
in a few minutes she came laughing into the room </s>
<s>  so delighted to see
them all that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure
from meeting her mother or the miss dashwoods again </s>
<s>   so surprised at
their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected all
along </s>
<s>  so angry at their accepting her mothers invitation after having
declined her own though at the same time she would never have forgiven
them if they had not come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer will be so happy to see you said she </s>
<s>  what do you think
he said when he heard of your coming with mama </s>
<s>   i forget what it was
now but it was something so droll </s>
<s> 

after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat
or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on <abvr> jenningss side and in laughter without cause on
mrs </s>
<s>  palmers it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to
which <abvr> jennings and elinor readily consented as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves </s>
<s>  and marianne though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise </s>
<s> 

wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch </s>
<s>   in bond
street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in
constant inquiry </s>
<s>  and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind
was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them from all
that interested and occupied the others </s>
<s>   restless and dissatisfied
every where her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article
of purchase however it might equally concern them both </s>
<s>  she received
no pleasure from anything </s>
<s>  was only impatient to be at home again and
could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of <abvr>
palmer whose eye was caught by every thing pretty expensive or new </s>
<s> 
who was wild to buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her
time in rapture and indecision </s>
<s> 

it was late in the morning before they returned home </s>
<s>  and no sooner had
they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when
elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there </s>
<s> 

has no letter been left here for me since we went out </s>
<s>  said she to
the footman who then entered with the parcels </s>
<s>   she was answered in the
negative </s>
<s>   are you quite sure of it </s>
<s>  she replied </s>
<s>   are you certain
that no servant no porter has left any letter or note </s>
<s> 

the man replied that none had </s>
<s> 

how very odd </s>
<s>  said she in a low and disappointed voice as she
turned away to the window </s>
<s> 

how odd indeed </s>
<s>  repeated elinor within herself regarding her sister
with uneasiness </s>
<s>   if she had not known him to be in town she would not
have written to him as she did </s>
<s>  she would have written to combe magna </s>
<s> 
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in
so doubtful so mysterious a manner </s>
<s>   i long to inquire </s>
<s>  and how will
my interference be borne </s>
<s> 

she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued
many days longer as unpleasant as they now were she would represent in
the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious
enquiry into the affair </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer and two elderly ladies of <abvr> jenningss intimate
acquaintance whom she had met and invited in the morning dined with
them </s>
<s>   the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening
engagements </s>
<s>  and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others </s>
<s>   marianne was of no use on these occasions as she
would never learn the game </s>
<s>  but though her time was therefore at her

chapter 


if this open weather holds much longer said <abvr> jennings when they
met at breakfast the following morning sir john will not like leaving
barton next week </s>
<s>  tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a days
pleasure </s>
<s>   poor souls </s>
<s>   i always pity them when they do </s>
<s>  they seem to
take it so much to heart </s>
<s> 

that is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice and walking to the
window as she spoke to examine the day </s>
<s>   i had not thought of that </s>
<s> 
this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country </s>
<s> 

it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it </s>
<s> 
it is charming weather for them indeed she continued as she sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance </s>
<s>   how much they
must enjoy it </s>
<s>  but with a little return of anxiety it cannot be
expected to last long </s>
<s>   at this time of the year and after such a
series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it </s>
<s>   frosts
will soon set in and in all probability with severity </s>
<s>   in another day
or two perhaps </s>
<s>  this extreme mildness can hardly last longernay
perhaps it may freeze tonight </s>
<s> 

at any rate said elinor wishing to prevent <abvr> jennings from
seeing her sisters thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we
shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week </s>
<s> 

ay my dear ill warrant you we do </s>
<s>   mary always has her own way </s>
<s> 

and now silently conjectured elinor she will write to combe by
this days post </s>
<s> 

but if she did the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact </s>
<s>   whatever the
truth of it might be and far as elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it yet while she saw marianne in spirits she could
not be very uncomfortable herself </s>
<s>   and marianne was in spirits </s>
<s>  happy
in the mildness of the weather and still happier in her expectation of
a frost </s>
<s> 

the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of <abvr>
jenningss acquaintance to inform them of her being in town </s>
<s>  and
marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air </s>
<s> 

dont you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor </s>
<s>  there
seems to me a very decided difference </s>
<s>   i can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff </s>
<s>   it was not so yesterday i think </s>
<s>   the clouds seem
parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear
afternoon </s>
<s> 

elinor was alternately diverted and pained </s>
<s>  but marianne persevered
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching
frost </s>
<s> 

the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with <abvr>
jenningss style of living and set of acquaintance than with her
behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind </s>
<s>   every thing in her
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and
excepting a few old city friends whom to lady middletons regret she
had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her young companions </s>
<s>   pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had
expected elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or
abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon who had a general invitation to the house was with
them almost every day </s>
<s>  he came to look at marianne and talk to elinor
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from
any other daily occurrence but who saw at the same time with much
concern his continued regard for her sister </s>
<s>   she feared it was a
strengthening regard </s>
<s>   it grieved her to see the earnestness with which
he often watched marianne and his spirits were certainly worse than
when at barton </s>
<s> 

about a week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was
also arrived </s>
<s>   his card was on the table when they came in from the
mornings drive </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  cried marianne he has been here while we were out </s>
<s> 
elinor rejoiced to be assured of his being in london now ventured to
say depend upon it he will call again tomorrow </s>
<s>   but marianne
seemed hardly to hear her and on <abvr> jenningss entrance escaped with
the precious card </s>
<s> 

this event while it raised the spirits of elinor restored to those of
her sister all and more than all their former agitation </s>
<s>   from this
moment her mind was never quiet </s>
<s>  the expectation of seeing him every
hour of the day made her unfit for any thing </s>
<s>   she insisted on being
left behind the next morning when the others went out </s>
<s> 

elinors thoughts were full of what might be passing in berkeley street
during their absence </s>
<s>  but a moments glance at her sister when they
returned was enough to inform her that willoughby had paid no second
visit there </s>
<s>   a note was just then brought in and laid on the table </s>
<s> 

for me </s>
<s>  cried marianne stepping hastily forward </s>
<s> 

no maam for my mistress </s>
<s> 

but marianne not convinced took it instantly up </s>
<s> 

it is indeed for <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  how provoking </s>
<s> 

you are expecting a letter then </s>
<s>  said elinor unable to be longer
silent </s>
<s> 

yes a littlenot much </s>
<s> 

after a short pause </s>
<s>   you have no confidence in me marianne </s>
<s> 

nay elinor this reproach from youyou who have confidence in no
one </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  returned elinor in some confusion </s>
<s>  indeed marianne i have
nothing to tell </s>
<s> 

nor i answered marianne with energy our situations then are alike </s>
<s> 
we have neither of us any thing to tell </s>
<s>  you because you do not
communicate and i because i conceal nothing </s>
<s> 

elinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself which she was
not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstances to
press for greater openness in marianne </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings soon appeared and the note being given her she read it
aloud </s>
<s>   it was from lady middleton announcing their arrival in conduit
street the night before and requesting the company of her mother and
cousins the following evening </s>
<s>   business on sir johns part and a
violent cold on her own prevented their calling in berkeley street </s>
<s> 
the invitation was accepted </s>
<s>  but when the hour of appointment drew
near necessary as it was in common civility to <abvr> jennings that
they should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her sister to go for still she had seen nothing of
willoughby </s>
<s>  and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad
than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence </s>
<s> 

elinor found when the evening was over that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode for although scarcely settled
in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty
young people and to amuse them with a ball </s>
<s>   this was an affair
however of which lady middleton did not approve </s>
<s>   in the country an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable </s>
<s>  but in london where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it
known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple with two violins and a mere sideboard collation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer were of the party </s>
<s>  from the former whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town as he was careful to avoid
the appearance of any attention to his motherinlaw and therefore
never came near her they received no mark of recognition on their
entrance </s>
<s>   he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they
were and merely nodded to <abvr> jennings from the other side of the
room </s>
<s>   marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered </s>
<s>  it
was enoughhe was not thereand she sat down equally illdisposed to
receive or communicate pleasure </s>
<s>   after they had been assembled about
an hour <abvr> palmer sauntered towards the miss dashwoods to express his
surprise on seeing them in town though colonel brandon had been first
informed of their arrival at his house and he had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come </s>
<s> 

i thought you were both in devonshire said he </s>
<s> 

did you </s>
<s>  replied elinor </s>
<s> 

when do you go back again </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  and thus ended their discourse </s>
<s> 

never had marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life as she was
that evening and never so much fatigued by the exercise </s>
<s>   she
complained of it as they returned to berkeley street </s>
<s> 

aye aye said <abvr> jennings we know the reason of all that very
well </s>
<s>  if a certain person who shall be nameless had been there you
would not have been a bit tired </s>
<s>  and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited </s>
<s> 

invited </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s> 

so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him
somewhere in the street this morning </s>
<s>  marianne said no more but
looked exceedingly hurt </s>
<s>   impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her sisters relief elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her mother and hoped by awakening her fears
for the health of marianne to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed </s>
<s>  and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne was again
writing to willoughby for she could not suppose it to be to any other
person </s>
<s> 

about the middle of the day <abvr> jennings went out by herself on
business and elinor began her letter directly while marianne too
restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one
window to the other or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation </s>
<s> 
elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother relating all
that had passed her suspicions of willoughbys inconstancy urging her
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account
of her real situation with respect to him </s>
<s> 

her letter was scarcely finished when a rap foretold a visitor and
colonel brandon was announced </s>
<s>   marianne who had seen him from the
window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he
entered it </s>
<s>   he looked more than usually grave and though expressing
satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he had somewhat in
particular to tell her sat for some time without saying a word </s>
<s> 
elinor persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her
sister was concerned impatiently expected its opening </s>
<s>   it was not the
first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction </s>
<s>  for more than
once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks
unwell today or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared
on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something
particular about her </s>
<s>   after a pause of several minutes their silence
was broken by his asking her in a voice of some agitation when he was
to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother </s>
<s>   elinor was not
prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant </s>
<s>   he
tried to smile as he replied your sisters engagement to <abvr>
willoughby is very generally known </s>
<s> 

it cannot be generally known returned elinor for her own family do
not know it </s>
<s> 

he looked surprised and said i beg your pardon i am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent </s>
<s>  but i had not supposed any secrecy
intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally
talked of </s>
<s> 

how can that be </s>
<s>  by whom can you have heard it mentioned </s>
<s> 

by manyby some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are
most intimate <abvr> jennings <abvr> palmer and the middletons </s>
<s>   but
still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to
support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today
accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to <abvr> willoughby in
your sisters writing </s>
<s>   i came to inquire but i was convinced before i
could ask the question </s>
<s>   is every thing finally settled </s>
<s>   is it
impossible to </s>
<s>   but i have no right and i could have no chance of
succeeding </s>
<s>   excuse me miss dashwood </s>
<s>   i believe i have been wrong in
saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i
have the strongest dependence </s>
<s>   tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if
concealment be possible is all that remains </s>
<s> 

these words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal of his love for
her sister affected her very much </s>
<s>   she was not immediately able to
say anything and even when her spirits were recovered she debated for
a short time on the answer it would be most proper to give </s>
<s>   the real
state of things between willoughby and her sister was so little known
to herself that in endeavouring to explain it she might be as liable
to say too much as too little </s>
<s>   yet as she was convinced that
mariannes affection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel
brandons success whatever the event of that affection might be and
at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure she thought
it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than
she really knew or believed </s>
<s>   she acknowledged therefore that though
she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
stood with each other of their mutual affection she had no doubt and
of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear </s>
<s> 

he listened to her with silent attention and on her ceasing to speak
rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion
to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness </s>
<s>  to willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve hertook leave and went away </s>
<s> 

elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation to
lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points </s>
<s>  she was left on the
contrary with a melancholy impression of colonel brandons
unhappiness and was prevented even from wishing it removed by her
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it </s>

chapter 


nothing occurred during the next three or four days to make elinor
regret what she had done in applying to her mother </s>
<s>  for willoughby
neither came nor wrote </s>
<s>   they were engaged about the end of that time
to attend lady middleton to a party from which <abvr> jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter </s>
<s>  and for this party
marianne wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming
equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure </s>
<s>   she sat by the
drawingroom fire after tea till the moment of lady middletons
arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude
lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her sisters presence </s>
<s>  and
when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the
door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected </s>
<s> 

they arrived in due time at the place of destination and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow alighted ascended the
stairs heard their names announced from one landingplace to another
in an audible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up quite full
of company and insufferably hot </s>
<s>   when they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience to which their arrival must necessarily add </s>
<s>   after some
time spent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat down to
cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for moving about she and
elinor luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great
distance from the table </s>
<s> 

they had not remained in this manner long before elinor perceived
willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman </s>
<s>   she soon
caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to
speak to her or to approach marianne though he could not but see her </s>
<s> 
and then continued his discourse with the same lady </s>
<s>   elinor turned
involuntarily to marianne to see whether it could be unobserved by
her </s>
<s>   at that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him
instantly had not her sister caught hold of her </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  she exclaimed he is therehe is thereoh </s>
<s>  why does
he not look at me </s>
<s>  why cannot i speak to him </s>
<s> 

pray pray be composed cried elinor and do not betray what you
feel to every body present </s>
<s>   perhaps he has not observed you yet </s>
<s> 

this however was more than she could believe herself </s>
<s>  and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne it
was beyond her wish </s>
<s>   she sat in an agony of impatience which affected
every feature </s>
<s> 

at last he turned round again and regarded them both </s>
<s>  she started up
and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection held out her hand to
him </s>
<s>   he approached and addressing himself rather to elinor than
marianne as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe
her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after <abvr> dashwood and
asked how long they had been in town </s>
<s>   elinor was robbed of all
presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word </s>
<s>   but
the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed </s>
<s>   her face was
crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion
good god </s>
<s>  willoughby what is the meaning of this </s>
<s>   have you not
received my letters </s>
<s>   will you not shake hands with me </s>
<s> 

he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he
held her hand only for a moment </s>
<s>   during all this time he was evidently
struggling for composure </s>
<s>   elinor watched his countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil </s>
<s>   after a moments pause he spoke
with calmness </s>
<s> 

i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday
and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and <abvr> jennings at home </s>
<s>   my card was not lost i hope </s>
<s> 

but have you not received my notes </s>
<s>  cried marianne in the wildest
anxiety </s>
<s>   here is some mistake i am suresome dreadful mistake </s>
<s>   what
can be the meaning of it </s>
<s>   tell me willoughby </s>
<s>  for heavens sake tell
me what is the matter </s>
<s> 

he made no reply </s>
<s>  his complexion changed and all his embarrassment
returned </s>
<s>  but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he
had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion
he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so
good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
his friend </s>
<s> 

marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into
her chair and elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried
to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with
lavender water </s>
<s> 

go to him elinor she cried as soon as she could speak and force
him to come to me </s>
<s>   tell him i must see him againmust speak to him
instantly </s>
<s>  i cannot resti shall not have a moments peace till this
is explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other </s>
<s>  oh go to him
this moment </s>
<s> 

how can that be done </s>
<s>  no my dearest marianne you must wait </s>
<s>   this is
not the place for explanations </s>
<s>   wait only till tomorrow </s>
<s> 

with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him
herself </s>
<s>  and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least
with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more
privacy and more effect was impossible </s>
<s>  for marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings
by exclamations of wretchedness </s>
<s>   in a short time elinor saw willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase and telling marianne
that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that
evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm </s>
<s>   she instantly begged
her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home as she was
too miserable to stay a minute longer </s>
<s> 

lady middleton though in the middle of a rubber on being informed
that marianne was unwell was too polite to object for a moment to her
wish of going away and making over her cards to a friend they
departed as soon the carriage could be found </s>
<s>   scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to berkeley street </s>
<s>   marianne was in a
silent agony too much oppressed even for tears </s>
<s>  but as <abvr> jennings
was luckily not come home they could go directly to their own room
where hartshorn restored her a little to herself </s>
<s>   she was soon
undressed and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone her
sister then left her and while she waited the return of <abvr> jennings
had leisure enough for thinking over the past </s>
<s> 

that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby and
marianne she could not doubt and that willoughby was weary of it
seemed equally clear </s>
<s>  for however marianne might still feed her own
wishes she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind </s>
<s>   nothing but a thorough change of
sentiment could account for it </s>
<s>   her indignation would have been still
stronger than it was had she not witnessed that embarrassment which
seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
the affections of her sister from the first without any design that
would bear investigation </s>
<s>   absence might have weakened his regard and
convenience might have determined him to overcome it but that such a
regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt </s>
<s> 

as for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her and on those still more severe which might await her in
its probable consequence she could not reflect without the deepest
concern </s>
<s>   her own situation gained in the comparison </s>
<s>  for while she
could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided in
future her mind might be always supported </s>
<s>   but every circumstance
that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
of marianne in a final separation from willoughbyin an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him </s>

chapter 


before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day or the sun
gained any power over a cold gloomy morning in january marianne only
half dressed was kneeling against one of the windowseats for the sake
of all the little light she could command from it and writing as fast
as a continual flow of tears would permit her </s>
<s>   in this situation
elinor roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs first perceived
her </s>
<s>  and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety
said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness

marianne may i ask </s>
<s> 

no elinor she replied ask nothing </s>
<s>  you will soon know all </s>
<s> 

the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no
longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return
of the same excessive affliction </s>
<s>   it was some minutes before she could
go on with her letter and the frequent bursts of grief which still
obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of
her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the
last time to willoughby </s>
<s> 

elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power </s>
<s>  and
she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not
marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability not to speak to her for the world </s>
<s>   in such
circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long
together </s>
<s>  and the restless state of mariannes mind not only prevented
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place made her
wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding the sight of every
body </s>
<s> 

at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any thing </s>
<s>  and
elinors attention was then all employed not in urging her not in
pitying her nor in appearing to regard her but in endeavouring to
engage <abvr> jenningss notice entirely to herself </s>
<s> 

as this was a favourite meal with <abvr> jennings it lasted a
considerable time and they were just setting themselves after it
round the common working table when a letter was delivered to
marianne which she eagerly caught from the servant and turning of a
deathlike paleness instantly ran out of the room </s>
<s>   elinor who saw as
plainly by this as if she had seen the direction that it must come
from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her
hardly able to hold up her head and sat in such a general tremour as
made her fear it impossible to escape <abvr> jenningss notice </s>
<s>   that good
lady however saw only that marianne had received a letter from
willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke and which she
treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh that she would find it to
her liking </s>
<s>   of elinors distress she was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any thing at all </s>
<s>  and
calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said

upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
life </s>
<s>   my girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish
enough </s>
<s>  but as for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature </s>
<s>   i
hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her waiting much
longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn </s>
<s> 
pray when are they to be married </s>
<s> 

elinor though never less disposed to speak than at that moment
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore
trying to smile replied and have you really maam talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sisters being engaged to <abvr> willoughby </s>
<s>   i
thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to
imply more </s>
<s>  and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive
yourself any longer </s>
<s>   i do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married </s>
<s> 

for shame for shame miss dashwood </s>
<s>  how can you talk so </s>
<s>   dont we
all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in
love with each other from the first moment they met </s>
<s>   did not i see
them together in devonshire every day and all day long </s>
<s>  and did not i
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
clothes </s>
<s>   come come this wont do </s>

yourself you think nobody else has any senses </s>

indeed you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings laughed again but elinor had not spirits to say more
and eager at all events to know what willoughby had written hurried
away to their room where on opening the door she saw marianne
stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand
and two or three others laying by her </s>
<s>   elinor drew near but without
saying a word </s>
<s>  and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed
her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of
tears which at first was scarcely less violent than mariannes </s>
<s>  the
latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction she
put all the letters into elinors hands </s>
<s>  and then covering her face
with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony </s>
<s>   elinor who knew
that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its
course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
itself and then turning eagerly to willoughbys letter read as
follows </s>

abhorrence of the man and so bitter were her feelings against him

sister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread and so
entirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearing

impropriety of their having been written at all </s>

grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs

condemned by the event when marianne perceiving that she had finished

he did </s>

blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear
to him as my own soul could wish </s>

so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication </s>

for a moment or two she could say no more </s>

passed away she added in a firmer tone

dearest marianne who but himself </s>
<s>   by whom can he have been
instigated </s>

by all the world rather than by his own heart </s>

beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not
rather suspect of evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well </s>
<s> 

elinor would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph
my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits </s>
<s>   it is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence </s>

no no cried marianne misery such as mine has no pride </s>

again they were both silent </s>

thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire
without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning
objects through the other </s>
<s>  and marianne seated at the foot of the bed
with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up
willoughbys letter and after shuddering over every sentence
exclaimed

it is too much </s>

<s> 
cruel cruelnothing can acquit you </s>

<s>   whatever
he might have heard against meought he not to have suspended his
belief </s>

<s> whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and
attractive among his female acquaintance </s>

another pause ensued </s>

it would be impossible to go tomorrow </s>
<s>  we owe <abvr> jennings much more
than civility </s>
<s>  and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a
hasty removal as that </s>
<s> 

well then another day or two perhaps </s>

cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people </s>

elinor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so </s>
<s>  but
no attitude could give her ease </s>
<s>  and in restless pain of mind and body
she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more
hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at
all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance </s>
<s>   some lavender drops however which she was at length
persuaded to take were of use </s>

returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless </s>

waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and
walked in with a look of real concern </s>

marianne who turned away her face without attempting to answer </s>

depend on it </s>

he is not the only young man in the world worth having </s>

pretty face you will never want admirers </s>
<s>   well poor thing </s>
<s>   i wont

she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room as if she
supposed her young friends affliction could be increased by noise </s>

marianne to the surprise of her sister determined on dining with
them </s>

<s>   but no she would go down </s>

she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less </s>
<s> 
elinor pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive
though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner
said no more </s>
<s>  and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could
while marianne still remained on the bed was ready to assist her into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it </s>
<s> 

when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer
than her sister had expected </s>
<s>   had she tried to speak or had she been
conscious of half <abvr> jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attentions
to her this calmness could not have been maintained </s>
<s>  but not a
syllable escaped her lips </s>
<s>  and the abstraction of her thoughts
preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her </s>
<s> 

elinor who did justice to <abvr> jenningss kindness though its
effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made
her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her
sister could not make or return for herself </s>
<s>   their good friend saw
that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing was due to her
which might make her at all less so </s>
<s>   she treated her therefore with
all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the

<s>   had not elinor

could have been entertained by <abvr> jenningss endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a
good fire </s>
<s>   as soon however as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer </s>
<s> 
with a hasty exclamation of misery and a sign to her sister not to
follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room </s>
<s> 

poor soul </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings as soon as she was gone how it

<s>   lord </s>
<s>  nothing seems

the lady thenmiss grey i think you called heris very rich </s>

today finished it </s>
<s>   poor soul </s>
<s>   i am sure if i had had a notion of it
i would not have joked her about it for all my money </s>

know how should i guess such a thing </s>

<s>   if i had my senses about me i might have
called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it </s>

it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution <abvr> palmer and
sir john against ever naming <abvr> willoughby or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed before my sister </s>
<s>   their own goodnature

oh </s>

<s> 
no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate </s>

certainly will </s>

does talking ever do you know </s>
<s> 

in this affair it can only do harm </s>
<s>  more so perhaps than in many cases
of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for

join marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room

refused to do </s>

aching head on the pillow and as she hoped in a way to get some quiet
rest before she left her </s>
<s> 

in the drawingroom whither she then repaired she was soon joined by
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings with a wineglass full of something in her hand </s>
<s> 

my dear said she entering i have just recollected that i have
some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was

husband </s>

colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else in the

<s> 

dear maam replied elinor smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended how good you are </s>
<s>   but i have
just left marianne in bed and i hope almost asleep </s>

nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me
leave i will drink the wine myself </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes
earlier was satisfied with the compromise </s>
<s>  and elinor as she
swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a
colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing
powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her sister </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea and by his manner
of looking round the room for marianne elinor immediately fancied that
he neither expected nor wished to see her there and in short that he
was already aware of what occasioned her absence </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings was
not struck by the same thought </s>

across the room to the teatable where elinor presided and whispered
the colonel looks as grave as ever you see </s>

he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers and with a look
which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her
sister </s>

marianne is not well said she </s>

in a stationers shop in pall mall where i had business </s>

pounds </s>

it may be so </s>

a moment </s>

he made no answer </s>

teathings and the arrangement of the card parties the subject was
necessarily dropped </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking and who expected to see the effect of miss

chapter 


from a night of more sleep than she had expected marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had
closed her eyes </s>
<s> 

elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt </s>
<s>  and
before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and
again </s>
<s>  and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
elinors side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
mariannes as before </s>
<s>   sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him </s>
<s>   at one moment she
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world at
another she would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third
could resist it with energy </s>
<s>   in one thing however she was uniform
when it came to the point in avoiding where it was possible the
presence of <abvr> jennings and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it </s>
<s>   her heart was hardened against the belief of <abvr>
jenningss entering into her sorrows with any compassion </s>
<s> 

no no no it cannot be she cried </s>
<s>  she cannot feel </s>
<s>   her kindness
is not sympathy </s>
<s>  her goodnature is not tenderness </s>
<s>   all that she wants
is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it </s>
<s> 

elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her
sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable
refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished
manner </s>
<s>   like half the rest of the world if more than half there be
that are clever and good marianne with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid </s>
<s>   she expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself </s>
<s>   thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast which sunk the heart of <abvr>
jennings still lower in her estimation </s>
<s>  because through her own
weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill </s>
<s> 

with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling
from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying

now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good </s>
<s> 

marianne heard enough </s>
<s>   in one moment her imagination placed before her
a letter from willoughby full of tenderness and contrition
explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory convincing </s>
<s>  and
instantly followed by willoughby himself rushing eagerly into the room
to inforce at her feet by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances
of his letter </s>
<s>   the work of one moment was destroyed by the next </s>
<s>   the
hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome was before her </s>
<s> 
and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
ecstasy of more than hope she felt as if till that instant she had
never suffered </s>
<s> 

the cruelty of <abvr> jennings no language within her reach in her
moments of happiest eloquence could have expressed </s>
<s>  and now she could
reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
passionate violencea reproach however so entirely lost on its
object that after many expressions of pity she withdrew still
referring her to the letter of comfort </s>
<s>   but the letter when she was
calm enough to read it brought little comfort </s>
<s>   willoughby filled
every page </s>
<s>   her mother still confident of their engagement and
relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by
elinors application to intreat from marianne greater openness towards
them both </s>
<s>  and this with such tenderness towards her such affection
for willoughby and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other that she wept with agony through the whole of it </s>
<s> 

all her impatience to be at home again now returned </s>
<s>  her mother was
dearer to her than ever </s>
<s>  dearer through the very excess of her mistaken
confidence in willoughby and she was wildly urgent to be gone </s>
<s> 
elinor unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne
to be in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own except of
patience till their mothers wishes could be known </s>
<s>  and at length she
obtained her sisters consent to wait for that knowledge </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings left them earlier than usual </s>
<s>  for she could not be easy
till the middletons and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself </s>
<s> 
and positively refusing elinors offered attendance went out alone for
the rest of the morning </s>
<s>   elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the
pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by mariannes
letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then
sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat
her directions for the future </s>
<s>  while marianne who came into the
drawingroom on <abvr> jenningss going away remained fixed at the table
where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over
her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her mother </s>
<s> 

in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when
marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was
startled by a rap at the door </s>
<s> 

who can this be </s>
<s>  cried elinor </s>
<s>   so early too </s>
<s>  i thought we had been
safe </s>
<s> 

marianne moved to the window

it is colonel brandon </s>
<s>  said she with vexation </s>
<s>   we are never safe
from him </s>
<s> 

he will not come in as <abvr> jennings is from home </s>
<s> 

i will not trust to that retreating to her own room </s>
<s>   a man who has
nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on
that of others </s>
<s> 

the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on
injustice and error </s>
<s>  for colonel brandon did come in </s>
<s>  and elinor who
was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither and who
saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look and in his
anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister
for esteeming him so lightly </s>
<s> 

i met <abvr> jennings in bond street said he after the first
salutation and she encouraged me to come on </s>

be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn marianne </s>

gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end and hers must be gained by it in time </s>

<s>   on such a subject sighing heavily can i have little
temptation to be diffuse </s>

he stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went
on </s>
<s> 

you have probably entirely forgotten a conversationit is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on youa conversation
between us one evening at barton parkit was the evening of a
dancein which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in
some measure your sister marianne </s>
<s> 

indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it </s>
<s>  he looked pleased
by this remembrance and added

if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender
recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well
in mind as person </s>
<s>   the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits </s>
<s>   this lady was one of my nearest relations an
orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father </s>
<s>   our
ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were
playfellows and friends </s>
<s>   i cannot remember the time when i did not
love eliza </s>
<s>  and my affection for her as we grew up was such as
perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you
might think me incapable of having ever felt </s>
<s>   hers for me was i
believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to <abvr> willoughby and
it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate </s>
<s>   at
seventeen she was lost to me for ever </s>
<s>   she was marriedmarried
against her inclination to my brother </s>
<s>   her fortune was large and our
family estate much encumbered </s>
<s>   and this i fear is all that can be
said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian </s>
<s> 
my brother did not deserve her </s>
<s>  he did not even love her </s>
<s>   i had hoped
that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for
some time it did </s>
<s>  but at last the misery of her situation for she
experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though
she had promised me that nothingbut how blindly i relate </s>
<s>   i have
never told you how this was brought on </s>
<s>   we were within a few hours of
eloping together for scotland </s>
<s>   the treachery or the folly of my
cousins maid betrayed us </s>
<s>   i was banished to the house of a relation
far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement
till my fathers point was gained </s>
<s>   i had depended on her fortitude too
far and the blow was a severe onebut had her marriage been happy so
young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at
least i should not have now to lament it </s>
<s>   this however was not the
case </s>
<s>   my brother had no regard for her </s>
<s>  his pleasures were not what
they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly </s>
<s> 
the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so
inexperienced as <abvr> brandons was but too natural </s>
<s>   she resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her situation </s>
<s>  and happy had it
been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
remembrance of me occasioned </s>
<s>   but can we wonder that with such a
husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or
restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their
marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should
fall </s>
<s>   had i remained in england perhapsbut i meant to promote the
happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose
had procured my exchange </s>
<s>   the shock which her marriage had given me
he continued in a voice of great agitation was of trifling
weightwas nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years
afterwards of her divorce </s>
<s>   it was that which threw this gloomeven

he could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room </s>

distress could not speak </s>
<s>   he saw her concern and coming to her took
her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect </s>
<s>   a few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure </s>
<s> 

it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned
to england </s>
<s>   my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek
for her </s>
<s>  but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy </s>
<s>   i could
not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to
fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of
sin </s>
<s>   her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor
sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person </s>
<s>   he imagined and calmly could he imagine it
that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to
dispose of it for some immediate relief </s>
<s>   at last however and after i
had been six months in england i did find her </s>
<s>   regard for a former
servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to
visit him in a spunginghouse where he was confined for debt </s>
<s>  and
there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate
sister </s>
<s>   so alteredso fadedworn down by acute suffering of every
kind </s>
<s>  hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before
me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom
i had once doted </s>
<s>   what i endured in so beholding herbut i have no
right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe iti have
pained you too much already </s>
<s>   that she was to all appearance in the
last stage of a consumption wasyes in such a situation it was my
greatest comfort </s>

you for nothing </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  miss dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched
for fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all </s>
<s>   i will be
more collectedmore concise </s>
<s>   she left to my care her only child a
little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then
about three years old </s>
<s>   she loved the child and had always kept it
with her </s>
<s>   it was a valued a precious trust to me </s>
<s>  and gladly would i
have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her
education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it </s>
<s>  but i
had no family no home </s>
<s>  and my little eliza was therefore placed at
school </s>
<s>   i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my
brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the
possession of the family property she visited me at delaford </s>
<s>   i
called her a distant relation </s>
<s>  but i am well aware that i have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her </s>
<s>   it is now
three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i
removed her from school to place her under the care of a very
respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life </s>
<s>  and for two years i
had every reason to be pleased with her situation </s>
<s>   but last february
almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared </s>
<s>   i had allowed
her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire
to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her
father there for his health </s>
<s>   i knew him to be a very good sort of man
and i thought well of his daughterbetter than she deserved for with
a most obstinate and illjudged secrecy she would tell nothing would
give no clue though she certainly knew all </s>
<s>   he her father a
wellmeaning but not a quicksighted man could really i believe
give no information </s>
<s>  for he had been generally confined to the house
while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance
they chose </s>
<s>  and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was
convinced himself of his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the
business </s>
<s>   in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone </s>
<s>  all
the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture </s>
<s>   what i
thought what i feared may be imagined </s>
<s>  and what i suffered too </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elinor could it becould willoughby </s>
<s> 

the first news that reached me of her he continued came in a
letter from herself last october </s>
<s>   it was forwarded to me from
delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party
to whitwell </s>
<s>  and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly
which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body
and which i believe gave offence to some </s>
<s>   little did <abvr> willoughby
imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom
he had made poor and miserable </s>
<s>  but had he known it what would it have
availed </s>
<s>   would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of
your sister </s>
<s>   no he had already done that which no man who can feel
for another would do </s>
<s>   he had left the girl whose youth and innocence
he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no
creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address </s>
<s>   he had
left her promising to return </s>
<s>  he neither returned nor wrote nor
relieved her </s>

this is beyond every thing </s>
<s>  exclaimed elinor </s>
<s> 

his character is now before you </s>
<s>  expensive dissipated and worse than

<s>   knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what

<s>   when i came to you last week and found you alone
i came determined to know the truth </s>

now you will comprehend it </s>
<s>   to suffer you all to be so deceived </s>
<s>  to
see your sisterbut what could i do </s>
<s>   i had no hope of interfering
with success </s>
<s>  and sometimes i thought your sisters influence might yet
reclaim him </s>
<s>   but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what
were his designs on her </s>
<s>   whatever they may have been however she may
now and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own
condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she
considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and
pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as
strong as her own and with a mind tormented by selfreproach which
must attend her through life </s>
<s>   surely this comparison must have its use
with her </s>
<s>   she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing </s>
<s>   they
proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace </s>
<s>   on the
contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them </s>

<s>   use your own discretion however in

will be its effect </s>
<s>  but had i not seriously and from my heart believed
it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have
suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family
afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to
raise myself at the expense of others </s>
<s> 

elinors thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness </s>
<s> 
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to
marianne from the communication of what had passed </s>
<s> 

i have been more pained said she by her endeavors to acquit him
than by all the rest </s>
<s>  for it irritates her mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do </s>

she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier </s>

elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying

reluctantly the name of her lover </s>

meeting therefore never got abroad </s>

elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this </s>

resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter </s>

chapter 


when the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss
dashwood to her sister as they very soon were the effect on her was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see </s>

it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither
objection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby and
seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible </s>

though this behaviour assured elinor that the conviction of this guilt
was carried home to her mind though she saw with satisfaction the
effect of it in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called

compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits less violently
irritated than before she did not see her less wretched </s>
<s>   her mind did
become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection </s>

loss of willoughbys character yet more heavily than she had felt the
loss of his heart </s>

misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might once
have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that
she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to elinor </s>

and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister
than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
confession of them </s>
<s> 

to give the feelings or the language of <abvr> dashwood on receiving and
answering elinors letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her daughters had already felt and said </s>
<s>  of a disappointment hardly
less painful than mariannes and an indignation even greater than
elinors </s>
<s>   long letters from her quickly succeeding each other
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought </s>
<s>  to express her
anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat she would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune </s>
<s>   bad indeed must the nature of
mariannes affliction be when her mother could talk of fortitude </s>
<s> 
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets which
she could wish her not to indulge </s>
<s> 

against the interest of her own individual comfort <abvr> dashwood had
determined that it would be better for marianne to be any where at
that time than at barton where every thing within her view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by
constantly placing willoughby before her such as she had always seen
him there </s>
<s>   she recommended it to her daughters therefore by all
means not to shorten their visit to <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  the length of which
though never exactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at
least five or six weeks </s>
<s>   a variety of occupations of objects and of
company which could not be procured at barton would be inevitable
there and might yet she hoped cheat marianne at times into some
interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the
ideas of both might now be spurned by her </s>
<s> 

from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her
friends </s>
<s>   design could never bring them in each others way </s>
<s>  negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise </s>
<s>  and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of
barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at
allenham on his marriage which <abvr> dashwood from foreseeing at first
as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one </s>
<s> 

she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where
they were </s>
<s>  a letter from her soninlaw had told her that he and his
wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother </s>
<s> 

marianne had promised to be guided by her mothers opinion and she
submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved
perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt
it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by
requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only
possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her
mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her ever knowing a moments rest </s>
<s> 

but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her sister </s>
<s>  and elinor on the other
hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward
entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better
for marianne than an immediate return into devonshire </s>
<s> 

her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing willoughbys
name mentioned was not thrown away </s>
<s>   marianne though without knowing
it herself reaped all its advantage </s>
<s>  for neither <abvr> jennings nor
sir john nor even <abvr> palmer herself ever spoke of him before her </s>
<s> 
elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself but that was impossible and she was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all </s>
<s> 

sir john could not have thought it possible </s>
<s>   a man of whom he had
always had such reason to think well </s>
<s>   such a goodnatured fellow </s>
<s>   he
did not believe there was a bolder rider in england </s>
<s>   it was an
unaccountable business </s>
<s>   he wished him at the devil with all his heart </s>
<s> 
he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for
all the world </s>
<s>   no not if it were to be by the side of barton covert
and they were kept watching for two hours together </s>
<s>   such a scoundrel
of a fellow </s>
<s>  such a deceitful dog </s>
<s>   it was only the last time they met
that he had offered him one of follys puppies </s>
<s>  and this was the end of
it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer in her way was equally angry </s>
<s>   she was determined to
drop his acquaintance immediately and she was very thankful that she
had never been acquainted with him at all </s>
<s>   she wished with all her
heart combe magna was not so near cleveland </s>
<s>  but it did not signify
for it was a great deal too far off to visit </s>
<s>  she hated him so much
that she was resolved never to mention his name again and she should
tell everybody she saw how goodfornothing he was </s>
<s> 

the rest of <abvr> palmers sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
particulars in her power of the approaching marriage and communicating
them to elinor </s>
<s>   she could soon tell at what coachmakers the new
carriage was building by what painter <abvr> willoughbys portrait was
drawn and at what warehouse miss greys clothes might be seen </s>
<s> 

the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to elinors spirits oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others </s>
<s>   it was a great comfort to her to be
sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle
of friends </s>
<s>  a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet
her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for
her sisters health </s>
<s> 

every qualification is raised at times by the circumstances of the
moment to more than its real value </s>
<s>  and she was sometimes worried down
by officious condolence to rate goodbreeding as more indispensable to
comfort than goodnature </s>
<s> 

lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day
or twice if the subject occurred very often by saying it is very
shocking indeed </s>
<s>  and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter </s>
<s>  and having thus supported the
dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was
wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather
against the opinion of sir john that as <abvr> willoughby would at once
be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon
as she married </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to miss dashwood </s>
<s>   he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her sisters disappointment by the friendly zeal with
which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always conversed with
confidence </s>
<s>   his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations was given in the pitying eye
with which marianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness of her
voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged or
could oblige herself to speak to him </s>
<s>   these assured him that his
exertion had produced an increase of goodwill towards himself and
these gave elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter </s>
<s>  but
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew only that the
colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail
on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for
him began at the end of two days to think that instead of
midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all </s>
<s>   the good understanding
between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberrytree the canal and the yew arbour would all
be made over to her </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings had for some time ceased to
think at all of <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

early in february within a fortnight from the receipt of willoughbys
letter elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he
was married </s>
<s>   she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over as she was
desirous that marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning </s>
<s> 

she received the news with resolute composure </s>
<s>  made no observation on
it and at first shed no tears </s>
<s>  but after a short time they would burst
out and for the rest of the day she was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event </s>
<s> 

the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married </s>
<s>  and elinor now
hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to
prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before </s>
<s> 

about this time the two miss steeles lately arrived at their cousins
house in bartletts buildings holburn presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets </s>
<s>  and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality </s>
<s> 

elinor only was sorry to see them </s>
<s>   their presence always gave her
pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of lucy in finding her still in town </s>
<s> 

i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here
still said she repeatedly with a strong emphasis on the word </s>
<s>   but
i always thought i should </s>
<s>   i was almost sure you would not leave
london yet awhile </s>
<s>  though you told me you know at barton that you
should not stay above a month </s>

<s>   it would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
sister came </s>
<s>   and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone </s>
<s>   i
am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word </s>

elinor perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her
selfcommand to make it appear that she did not </s>
<s> 

well my dear said <abvr> jennings and how did you travel </s>
<s> 

not in the stage i assure you replied miss steele with quick
exultation </s>
<s>  we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to
attend us </s>
<s>   <abvr> davies was coming to town and so we thought wed join
him in a postchaise </s>
<s>  and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did </s>
<s> 

oh oh </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  very pretty indeed </s>

a single man i warrant you </s>

there now said miss steele affectedly simpering everybody laughs
at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why </s>
<s>   my cousins say they
are sure i have made a conquest </s>

think about him from one hours end to another </s>

street to the house </s>

aye aye that is very pretty talkingbut it wont dothe doctor is

no indeed </s>
<s>  replied her cousin with affected earnestness and i beg
you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she
certainly would not and miss steele was made completely happy </s>
<s> 

i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss
dashwood when they come to town said lucy returning after a
cessation of hostile hints to the charge </s>
<s> 

no i do not think we shall </s>
<s> 

oh yes i dare say you will </s>
<s> 

elinor would not humour her by farther opposition </s>
<s> 

what a charming thing it is that <abvr> dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together </s>
<s> 

long a time indeed </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   why their visit is
but just begun </s>
<s> 

lucy was silenced </s>
<s> 

i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood said miss
steele </s>
<s>   i am sorry she is not well for marianne had left the room
on their arrival </s>
<s> 

you are very good </s>
<s>   my sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you </s>
<s>  but she has been very much plagued lately with
nervous headaches which make her unfit for company or conversation </s>
<s> 

oh dear that is a great pity </s>
<s>  but such old friends as lucy and
me </s>
<s> i think she might see us </s>
<s>  and i am sure we would not speak a word </s>
<s> 

elinor with great civility declined the proposal </s>
<s>   her sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore
not able to come to them </s>
<s> 

oh if thats all cried miss steele we can just as well go and see
her </s>
<s> 

elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper </s>
<s>  but she
was saved the trouble of checking it by lucys sharp reprimand which
now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other </s>

chapter 


after some opposition marianne yielded to her sisters entreaties and
consented to go out with her and <abvr> jennings one morning for half an
hour </s>
<s>  she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and
would do no more than accompany them to grays in sackville street
where elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
oldfashioned jewels of her mother </s>
<s> 

when they stopped at the door <abvr> jennings recollected that there was
a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call </s>
<s>  and as
she had no business at grays it was resolved that while her young
friends transacted theirs she should pay her visit and return for
them </s>
<s> 

on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders </s>
<s>  and they were obliged to wait </s>
<s>   all that could be done
was to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession </s>
<s>  one gentleman only was standing there and it is
probable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to
a quicker despatch </s>
<s>   but the correctness of his eye and the delicacy
of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness </s>
<s>   he was giving orders
for a toothpickcase for himself and till its size shape and
ornaments were determined all of which after examining and debating
for a quarter of an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop were
finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure to
bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised
in three or four very broad stares </s>
<s>  a kind of notice which served to
imprint on elinor the remembrance of a person and face of strong
natural sterling insignificance though adorned in the first style of
fashion </s>
<s> 

marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on
the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpickcases presented to his inspection by remaining
unconscious of it all </s>
<s>  for she was as well able to collect her thoughts
within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in
mr </s>
<s>  grays shop as in her own bedroom </s>
<s> 

at last the affair was decided </s>
<s>   the ivory the gold and the pearls
all received their appointment and the gentleman having named the last
day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of
the toothpickcase drew on his gloves with leisurely care and
bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such a one as
seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with a
happy air of real conceit and affected indifference </s>
<s> 

elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward was on the point
of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side </s>
<s> 
she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise
to be her brother </s>
<s> 

their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in <abvr> grays shop </s>
<s>   john dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his sisters again </s>
<s>  it rather gave them
satisfaction </s>
<s>  and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive </s>
<s> 

elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days </s>
<s> 

i wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it was
impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at
exeter exchange </s>
<s>  and we spent the rest of the day with <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 
harry was vastly pleased </s>
<s>   this morning i had fully intended to call on
you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so
much to do on first coming to town </s>
<s>   i am come here to bespeak fanny a
seal </s>
<s>   but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in
berkeley street and be introduced to your friend <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   i
understand she is a woman of very good fortune </s>
<s>   and the middletons
too you must introduce me to them </s>
<s>   as my motherinlaws relations i
shall be happy to show them every respect </s>
<s>   they are excellent
neighbours to you in the country i understand </s>
<s> 

excellent indeed </s>
<s>   their attention to our comfort their friendliness
in every particular is more than i can express </s>
<s> 

i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word </s>
<s>  extremely glad indeed </s>
<s> 
but so it ought to be </s>
<s>  they are people of large fortune they are
related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected </s>
<s>   and so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing </s>
<s>   edward brought us a most charming account of the place </s>
<s>  the
most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing </s>
<s>   it was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it i assure you </s>
<s> 

elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother </s>
<s>  and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of <abvr>
jenningss servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for
them at the door </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to <abvr> jennings
at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to
call on them the next day took leave </s>
<s> 

his visit was duly paid </s>
<s>   he came with a pretence at an apology from
their sisterinlaw for not coming too </s>
<s>  but she was so much engaged
with her mother that really she had no leisure for going any where </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand
upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she
should certainly wait on <abvr> john dashwood very soon and bring her
sisters to see her </s>
<s>   his manners to them though calm were perfectly
kind </s>
<s>  to <abvr> jennings most attentively civil </s>
<s>  and on colonel
brandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity
which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be
equally civil to him </s>
<s> 

after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with him
to conduit street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton </s>
<s> 
the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented </s>
<s>   as soon as
they were out of the house his enquiries began </s>
<s> 

who is colonel brandon </s>
<s>   is he a man of fortune </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  he has very good property in dorsetshire </s>
<s> 

i am glad of it </s>
<s>   he seems a most gentlemanlike man </s>
<s>  and i think
elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life </s>
<s> 

me brother </s>
<s>  what do you mean </s>
<s> 

he likes you </s>
<s>   i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it </s>
<s>   what
is the amount of his fortune </s>
<s> 

i believe about two thousand a year </s>
<s> 

two thousand ayear </s>
<s>  and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity he added elinor i wish with all my heart it
were twice as much for your sake </s>
<s> 

indeed i believe you replied elinor </s>
<s>  but i am very sure that
colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken elinor </s>
<s>  you are very much mistaken </s>
<s>   a very little
trouble on your side secures him </s>
<s>   perhaps just at present he may be
undecided </s>
<s>  the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back </s>
<s>  his
friends may all advise him against it </s>
<s>   but some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him in spite of himself </s>
<s>   and there can be no reason why you should
not try for him </s>
<s>   it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your sidein short you know as to an attachment of that kind it is
quite out of the question the objections are insurmountableyou have
too much sense not to see all that </s>
<s>   colonel brandon must be the man </s>
<s> 
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with
you and your family </s>
<s>   it is a match that must give universal
satisfaction </s>
<s>   in short it is a kind of thing thatlowering his
voice to an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome to all
parties </s>
<s>  recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to
sayyour friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled </s>
<s>  fanny
particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure
you </s>
<s>   and her mother too <abvr> ferrars a very goodnatured woman i am
sure it would give her great pleasure </s>
<s>  she said as much the other day </s>
<s> 

elinor would not vouchsafe any answer </s>
<s> 

it would be something remarkable now he continued something
droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the
same time </s>
<s>   and yet it is not very unlikely </s>
<s> 

is <abvr> edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be
married </s>
<s> 

it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation </s>
<s> 
he has a most excellent mother </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars with the utmost
liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if
the match takes place </s>
<s>   the lady is the hon </s>
<s>  miss morton only daughter
of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds </s>
<s>   a very desirable
connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in
time </s>
<s>   a thousand ayear is a great deal for a mother to give away to
make over for ever </s>
<s>  but <abvr> ferrars has a noble spirit </s>
<s>   to give you
another instance of her liberality </s>
<s> the other day as soon as we came
to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now
she put banknotes into fannys hands to the amount of two hundred
pounds </s>
<s>   and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great
expense while we are here </s>
<s> 

he paused for her assent and compassion </s>
<s>  and she forced herself to say

your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable </s>
<s> 
but your income is a large one </s>
<s> 

not so large i dare say as many people suppose </s>
<s>   i do not mean to
complain however </s>
<s>  it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will
in time be better </s>
<s>   the enclosure of norland common now carrying on
is a most serious drain </s>
<s>   and then i have made a little purchase within
this half year </s>
<s>  east kingham farm you must remember the place where
old gibson used to live </s>
<s>   the land was so very desirable for me in
every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it
my duty to buy it </s>
<s>   i could not have answered it to my conscience to
let it fall into any other hands </s>
<s>   a man must pay for his convenience </s>
<s> 
and it has cost me a vast deal of money </s>
<s> 

more than you think it really and intrinsically worth </s>
<s> 

why i hope not that </s>
<s>   i might have sold it again the next day for
more than i gave </s>
<s>  but with regard to the purchasemoney i might have
been very unfortunate indeed </s>
<s>  for the stocks were at that time so low
that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my bankers
hands i must have sold out to very great loss </s>
<s> 

elinor could only smile </s>
<s> 

other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
norland </s>
<s>   our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the
stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were
to your mother </s>
<s>   far be it from me to repine at his doing so </s>
<s>  he had an
undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in
consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of
linen china &c </s>
<s>  to supply the place of what was taken away </s>
<s>   you may
guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being
rich and how acceptable <abvr> ferrarss kindness is </s>
<s> 

certainly said elinor </s>
<s>  and assisted by her liberality i hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances </s>
<s> 

another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied </s>
<s>  but
however there is still a great deal to be done </s>
<s>   there is not a stone
laid of fannys greenhouse and nothing but the plan of the
flowergarden marked out </s>
<s> 

where is the greenhouse to be </s>
<s> 

upon the knoll behind the house </s>
<s>   the old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it </s>
<s>   it will be a very fine object from many
parts of the park and the flowergarden will slope down just before
it and be exceedingly pretty </s>
<s>   we have cleared away all the old thorns
that grew in patches over the brow </s>
<s> 

elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself </s>
<s>  and was very
thankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation </s>
<s> 

having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of earrings for each of his sisters in his
next visit at grays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began
to congratulate elinor on having such a friend as <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

she seems a most valuable woman indeedher house her style of
living all bespeak an exceeding good income </s>
<s>  and it is an acquaintance
that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may
prove materially advantageous </s>
<s> her inviting you to town is certainly a
vast thing in your favour </s>
<s>  and indeed it speaks altogether so great a
regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be
forgotten </s>
<s>  she must have a great deal to leave </s>
<s> 

nothing at all i should rather suppose </s>
<s>  for she has only her
jointure which will descend to her children </s>
<s> 

but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income </s>
<s>   few
people of common prudence will do that </s>
<s>  and whatever she saves she
will be able to dispose of </s>
<s> 

and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her
daughters than to us </s>
<s> 

her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i
cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther </s>
<s> 
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and
treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on
her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not
disregard </s>
<s>   nothing can be kinder than her behaviour </s>
<s>  and she can
hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises </s>
<s> 

but she raises none in those most concerned </s>
<s>   indeed brother your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far </s>
<s> 

why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have

<s>   but my dear elinor what is
the matter with marianne </s>
<s>  she looks very unwell has lost her colour
and is grown quite thin </s>
<s>   is she ill </s>
<s> 

she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several
weeks </s>
<s> 

i am sorry for that </s>
<s>   at her time of life any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever </s>
<s>   hers has been a very short one </s>
<s>   she was
as handsome a girl last september as i ever saw </s>
<s>  and as likely to
attract the man </s>
<s>   there was something in her style of beauty to please
them particularly </s>
<s>   i remember fanny used to say that she would marry
sooner and better than you did </s>
<s>  not but what she is exceedingly fond of
you but so it happened to strike her </s>
<s>   she will be mistaken however </s>
<s> 
i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred ayear at the utmost and i am very much deceived if
you do not do better </s>
<s>   dorsetshire </s>
<s>   i know very little of dorsetshire </s>
<s> 
but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it </s>
<s> 
and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors </s>
<s> 

elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no
likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon </s>
<s>  but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention </s>
<s>   he had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal </s>
<s>  and an offer from
colonel brandon or a legacy from <abvr> jennings was the easiest means
of atoning for his own neglect </s>
<s> 

they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home and sir john
came in before their visit ended </s>
<s>   abundance of civilities passed on
all sides </s>
<s>   sir john was ready to like anybody and though <abvr> dashwood
did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very
goodnatured fellow </s>
<s>  while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his
appearance to think his acquaintance worth having </s>
<s>  and <abvr> dashwood
went away delighted with both </s>
<s> 

i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny said he as he
walked back with his sister </s>
<s>   lady middleton is really a most elegant
woman </s>
<s>   such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know </s>
<s>   and <abvr>
jennings too an exceedingly wellbehaved woman though not so elegant
as her daughter </s>
<s>   your sister need not have any scruple even of
visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and
very naturally </s>
<s>  for we only knew that <abvr> jennings was the widow of a
man who had got all his money in a low way </s>
<s>  and fanny and <abvr> ferrars
were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters
were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with </s>
<s>   but now
i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood had so much confidence in her husbands judgment
that she waited the very next day both on <abvr> jennings and her
daughter </s>
<s>  and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthy
her notice </s>
<s>  and as for lady middleton she found her one of the most
charming women in the world </s>
<s> 

lady middleton was equally pleased with <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   there was a
kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually
attracted them </s>
<s>  and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
propriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding </s>
<s> 

the same manners however which recommended <abvr> john dashwood to the
good opinion of lady middleton did not suit the fancy of <abvr> jennings
and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proudlooking woman
of uncordial address who met her husbands sisters without any
affection and almost without having anything to say to them </s>
<s>  for of
the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at least
seven minutes and a half in silence </s>
<s> 

elinor wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to ask
whether edward was then in town </s>
<s>  but nothing would have induced fanny
voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that
his marriage with miss morton was resolved on or till her husbands
expectations on colonel brandon were answered </s>
<s>  because she believed
them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion </s>
<s>   the
intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from
another quarter </s>
<s>   lucy came very shortly to claim elinors compassion
on being unable to see edward though he had arrived in town with <abvr>
and <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   he dared not come to bartletts buildings for fear
of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be
told they could do nothing at present but write </s>
<s> 

edward assured them himself of his being in town within a very short
time by twice calling in berkeley street </s>
<s>   twice was his card found on
the table when they returned from their mornings engagements </s>
<s>   elinor
was pleased that he had called </s>
<s>  and still more pleased that she had
missed him </s>
<s> 

the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the middletons that
though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to
give thema dinner </s>
<s>  and soon after their acquaintance began invited
them to dine in harley street where they had taken a very good house
for three months </s>
<s>   their sisters and <abvr> jennings were invited
likewise and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon who
always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager
civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure </s>
<s>   they were to
meet <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  but elinor could not learn whether her sons were to
be of the party </s>
<s>   the expectation of seeing her however was enough to
make her interested in the engagement </s>
<s>  for though she could now meet
edwards mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction though she could now see her with perfect
indifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being in
company with <abvr> ferrars her curiosity to know what she was like was
as lively as ever </s>
<s> 

the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon
afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearing
that the miss steeles were also to be at it </s>
<s> 

so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeable
had their assiduities made them to her that though lucy was certainly
not so elegant and her sister not even genteel she was as ready as
sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street </s>
<s>  and it
happened to be particularly convenient to the miss steeles as soon as
the dashwoods invitation was known that their visit should begin a
few days before the party took place </s>
<s> 

their claims to the notice of <abvr> john dashwood as the nieces of the
gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not
have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table </s>
<s>  but
as lady middletons guests they must be welcome </s>
<s>  and lucy who had long
wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of
their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity
of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life
than she was on receiving <abvr> john dashwoods card </s>
<s> 

on elinor its effect was very different </s>
<s>   she began immediately to
determine that edward who lived with his mother must be asked as his
mother was to a party given by his sister </s>
<s>  and to see him for the
first time after all that passed in the company of lucy </s>
<s> she hardly
knew how she could bear it </s>
<s> 

these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and
certainly not at all on truth </s>
<s>   they were relieved however not by her
own recollection but by the good will of lucy who believed herself to
be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that edward
certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal
when they were together </s>
<s> 

the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable motherinlaw </s>
<s> 

pity me dear miss dashwood </s>
<s>  said lucy as they walked up the stairs
togetherfor the middletons arrived so directly after <abvr> jennings
that they all followed the servant at the same timethere is nobody
here but you that can feel for me </s>
<s> i declare i can hardly stand </s>
<s> 
good gracious </s>
<s> in a moment i shall see the person that all my
happiness depends onthat is to be my mother </s>
<s> 

elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being miss mortons mother rather than her own
whom they were about to behold </s>
<s>  but instead of doing that she assured
her and with great sincerity that she did pity herto the utter
amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars was a little thin woman upright even to formality in
her figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect </s>
<s>   her
complexion was sallow </s>
<s>  and her features small without beauty and
naturally without expression </s>
<s>  but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature </s>
<s>   she was not a woman of
many words </s>
<s>  for unlike people in general she proportioned them to the
number of her ideas </s>
<s>  and of the few syllables that did escape her not
one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed with the spirited
determination of disliking her at all events </s>
<s> 

elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour </s>
<s>  a few months
ago it would have hurt her exceedingly </s>
<s>  but it was not in <abvr> ferrars
power to distress her by it now </s>
<s> and the difference of her manners to
the miss steeles a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her more only amused her </s>
<s>   she could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person for
lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others had they known
as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify </s>
<s>  while
she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat
pointedly slighted by both </s>
<s>   but while she smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied she could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from which
it sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the miss
steeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all
four </s>
<s> 

lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished </s>
<s>  and miss
steele wanted only to be teazed about <abvr> davies to be perfectly happy </s>
<s> 

the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thing
bespoke the mistresss inclination for show and the masters ability
to support it </s>
<s>   in spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the norland estate and in spite of its owner having once
been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
loss nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to
infer from it </s>
<s> no poverty of any kind except of conversation
appearedbut there the deficiency was considerable </s>
<s>   john dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife
had still less </s>
<s>   but there was no peculiar disgrace in this </s>
<s>  for it was
very much the case with the chief of their visitors who almost all
laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeablewant of sense either natural or improvedwant of
elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper </s>
<s> 

when the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom after dinner this poverty
was particularly evident for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse
with some varietythe variety of politics inclosing land and
breaking horsesbut then it was all over </s>
<s>  and one subject only engaged
the ladies till coffee came in which was the comparative heights of
harry dashwood and lady middletons second son william who were
nearly of the same age </s>
<s> 

had both the children been there the affair might have been determined
too easily by measuring them at once </s>
<s>  but as harry only was present it
was all conjectural assertion on both sides </s>
<s>  and every body had a right
to be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over
again as often as they liked </s>
<s> 

the parties stood thus </s>
<s> 

the two mothers though each really convinced that her own son was the
tallest politely decided in favour of the other </s>
<s> 

the two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity
were equally earnest in support of their own descendant </s>
<s> 

lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age and could not
conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them </s>
<s>  and miss steele with yet greater address gave it as
fast as she could in favour of each </s>
<s> 

elinor having once delivered her opinion on williams side by which
she offended <abvr> ferrars and fanny still more did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion </s>
<s>  and marianne when
called on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had no
opinion to give as she had never thought about it </s>
<s> 

before her removing from norland elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her sisterinlaw which being now just mounted and
brought home ornamented her present drawing room </s>
<s>  and these screens
catching the eye of john dashwood on his following the other gentlemen
into the room were officiously handed by him to colonel brandon for
his admiration </s>
<s> 

these are done by my eldest sister said he </s>
<s>  and you as a man of
taste will i dare say be pleased with them </s>
<s>   i do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well </s>
<s> 

the colonel though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship
warmly admired the screens as he would have done any thing painted by
miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited they were handed round for general inspection </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars
not aware of their being elinors work particularly requested to look
at them </s>
<s>  and after they had received gratifying testimony of lady
middletonss approbation fanny presented them to her mother
considerately informing her at the same time that they were done by
miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

humsaid <abvr> ferrarsvery prettyand without regarding them at
all returned them to her daughter </s>
<s> 

perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude
enoughfor colouring a little she immediately said

they are very pretty maamant they </s>
<s>  but then again the dread of
having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her
for she presently added

do you not think they are something in miss mortons style of
painting maam </s>
<s> she does paint most delightfully </s>
<s> how beautifully
her last landscape is done </s>
<s> 

beautifully indeed </s>
<s>   but she does every thing well </s>
<s> 

marianne could not bear this </s>
<s> she was already greatly displeased with
mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars </s>
<s>  and such illtimed praise of another at elinors
expense though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it provoked her immediately to say with warmth

this is admiration of a very particular kind </s>
<s> what is miss morton to
us </s>
<s> who knows or who cares for her </s>
<s> it is elinor of whom we think
and speak </s>
<s> 

and so saying she took the screens out of her sisterinlaws hands
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing herself up more
stiffly than ever pronounced in retort this bitter philippic miss
morton is lord mortons daughter </s>
<s> 

fanny looked very angry too and her husband was all in a fright at his
sisters audacity </s>
<s>   elinor was much more hurt by mariannes warmth than
she had been by what produced it </s>
<s>  but colonel brandons eyes as they
were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only what was amiable
in it the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point </s>
<s> 

mariannes feelings did not stop here </s>
<s>   the cold insolence of <abvr>
ferrarss general behaviour to her sister seemed to her to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to elinor as her own wounded heart
taught her to think of with horror </s>
<s>  and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sisters
chair and putting one arm round her neck and one cheek close to hers
said in a low but eager voice

dear dear elinor dont mind them </s>
<s>   dont let them make you unhappy </s>
<s> 

she could say no more </s>
<s>  her spirits were quite overcome and hiding her
face on elinors shoulder she burst into tears </s>
<s>   every bodys
attention was called and almost every body was concerned </s>
<s> colonel
brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s> 
jennings with a very intelligent ah </s>
<s>  poor dear immediately gave her
her salts </s>
<s>  and sir john felt so desperately enraged against the author
of this nervous distress that he instantly changed his seat to one
close by lucy steele and gave her in a whisper a brief account of
the whole shocking affair </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes however marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle and sit down among the rest </s>
<s>  though her spirits retained
the impression of what had passed the whole evening </s>
<s> 

poor marianne </s>
<s>  said her brother to colonel brandon in a low voice
as soon as he could secure his attention she has not such good
health as her sistershe is very nervousshe has not elinors
constitution </s>
<s> and one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal
attractions </s>
<s>   you would not think it perhaps but marianne was
remarkably handsome a few months ago </s>
<s>  quite as handsome as elinor </s>
<s> 
now you see it is all gone </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elinors curiosity to see <abvr> ferrars was satisfied </s>
<s>  she had found
in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable </s>
<s>  she had seen enough of her pride her
meanness and her determined prejudice against herself to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement and
retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise
free </s>
<s> and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake
that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other
of <abvr> ferrarss creation preserved her from all dependence upon her
caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion </s>
<s>   or at least if she
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edwards being fettered to
lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable she ought to
have rejoiced </s>
<s> 

she wondered that lucys spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> that her interest and her vanity should so
very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her
because she was not elinor appear a compliment to herselfor to allow
her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her because
her real situation was unknown </s>
<s>   but that it was so had not only been
declared by lucys eyes at the time but was declared over again the
next morning more openly for at her particular desire lady middleton
set her down in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone
to tell her how happy she was </s>
<s> 

the chance proved a lucky one for a message from <abvr> palmer soon
after she arrived carried <abvr> jennings away </s>
<s> 

my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were by themselves i
come to talk to you of my happiness </s>
<s>   could anything be so flattering
as <abvr> ferrarss way of treating me yesterday </s>
<s>   so exceeding affable
as she was </s>
<s> you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her </s>
<s> but
the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her
behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to
me </s>
<s>   now was not it so </s>
<s>  you saw it all </s>
<s>  and was not you quite struck
with it </s>
<s> 

she was certainly very civil to you </s>
<s> 

civil </s>
<s> did you see nothing but only civility </s>
<s>  i saw a vast deal
more </s>
<s>   such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me </s>
<s> no pride
no hauteur and your sister just the sameall sweetness and
affability </s>
<s> 

elinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still pressed her to
own that she had reason for her happiness </s>
<s>  and elinor was obliged to go
on </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of you </s>
<s> but as that was
not the case

i guessed you would say soreplied lucy quicklybut there was no
reason in the world why <abvr> ferrars should seem to like me if she did
not and her liking me is every thing </s>
<s>   you shant talk me out of my
satisfaction </s>
<s>   i am sure it will all end well and there will be no
difficulties at all to what i used to think </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is a
charming woman and so is your sister </s>
<s>   they are both delightful women
indeed </s>
<s> i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable <abvr>
dashwood was </s>
<s> 

to this elinor had no answer to make and did not attempt any </s>
<s> 

are you ill miss dashwood </s>
<s> you seem lowyou dont speak </s>
<s> sure you
ant well </s>
<s> 

i never was in better health </s>
<s> 

i am glad of it with all my heart </s>

<s>   i
should be sorry to have you ill </s>
<s>  you that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world </s>
<s> heaven knows what i should have done
without your friendship </s>
<s> 

elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success </s>
<s> 
but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she directly replied

indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next to
edwards love it is the greatest comfort i have </s>
<s> poor edward </s>
<s> but
now there is one good thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty
often for lady middletons delighted with <abvr> dashwood so we shall
be a good deal in harley street i dare say and edward spends half his
time with his sisterbesides lady middleton and <abvr> ferrars will
visit now </s>
<s> and <abvr> ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once they should always be glad to see me </s>
<s>  they are such
charming women </s>
<s> i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of
her you cannot speak too high </s>
<s> 

but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she should
tell her sister </s>
<s>   lucy continued </s>
<s> 

i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if <abvr> ferrars had took
a dislike to me </s>
<s>   if she had only made me a formal courtesy for
instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of
me and never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know what i meanif
i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave
it all up in despair </s>
<s>   i could not have stood it </s>
<s>   for where she does
dislike i know it is most violent </s>
<s> 

elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by
the doors being thrown open the servants announcing <abvr> ferrars and
edwards immediately walking in </s>
<s> 

it was a very awkward moment </s>
<s>  and the countenance of each shewed that
it was so </s>
<s>   they all looked exceedingly foolish </s>
<s>  and edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to
advance farther into it </s>
<s>   the very circumstance in its unpleasantest
form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen
on them </s>
<s> they were not only all three together but were together
without the relief of any other person </s>
<s>   the ladies recovered
themselves first </s>
<s>   it was not lucys business to put herself forward
and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up </s>
<s>   she could
therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him
said no more </s>
<s> 

but elinor had more to do </s>
<s>  and so anxious was she for his sake and her
own to do it well that she forced herself after a moments
recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost
easy and almost open </s>
<s>  and another struggle another effort still
improved them </s>
<s>   she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from
saying that she was happy to see him and that she had very much
regretted being from home when he called before in berkeley street </s>
<s> 
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as
a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of
lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her </s>
<s> 

her manners gave some reassurance to edward and he had courage enough
to sit down </s>
<s>  but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might
make it rare </s>
<s>  for his heart had not the indifference of lucys nor
could his conscience have quite the ease of elinors </s>
<s> 

lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word </s>
<s> 
and almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her mothers health
their coming to town &c </s>
<s>  which edward ought to have inquired about
but never did </s>
<s> 

her exertions did not stop here </s>
<s>  for she soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching
marianne to leave the others by themselves </s>
<s>  and she really did it and
that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on
the landingplace with the most highminded fortitude before she went
to her sister </s>
<s>   when that was once done however it was time for the
raptures of edward to cease </s>
<s>  for mariannes joy hurried her into the
drawingroom immediately </s>
<s>   her pleasure in seeing him was like every
other of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken </s>
<s>   she met
him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the
affection of a sister </s>
<s> 

dear edward </s>
<s>  she cried this is a moment of great happiness </s>
<s> this
would almost make amends for every thing </s>
<s> 

edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such
witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt </s>
<s>   again they all
sat down and for a moment or two all were silent </s>
<s>  while marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and
sometimes at elinor regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by lucys unwelcome presence </s>
<s>   edward was the first
to speak and it was to notice mariannes altered looks and express
his fear of her not finding london agree with her </s>
<s> 

oh dont think of me </s>
<s>  she replied with spirited earnestness though
her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke dont think of my
health </s>
<s>   elinor is well you see </s>
<s>   that must be enough for us both </s>
<s> 

this remark was not calculated to make edward or elinor more easy nor
to conciliate the good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with no
very benignant expression </s>
<s> 

do you like london </s>
<s>  said edward willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>   i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none </s>
<s> 
the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded </s>
<s>  and
thank heaven </s>
<s>  you are what you always were </s>
<s> 

she pausedno one spoke </s>
<s> 

i think elinor she presently added we must employ edward to take
care of us in our return to barton </s>
<s>   in a week or two i suppose we
shall be going </s>
<s>  and i trust edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge </s>
<s> 

poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even
himself </s>
<s>   but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily trace
it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and
soon talked of something else </s>
<s> 

we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday </s>
<s>   so dull so
wretchedly dull </s>
<s> but i have much to say to you on that head which
cannot be said now </s>
<s> 

and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever and of her
being particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more in
private </s>
<s> 

but why were you not there edward </s>
<s> why did you not come </s>
<s> 

i was engaged elsewhere </s>
<s> 

engaged </s>
<s>   but what was that when such friends were to be met </s>
<s> 

perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take some revenge on
her you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no
mind to keep them little as well as great </s>
<s> 

elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting </s>
<s>  for she calmly replied

not so indeed </s>
<s>  for seriously speaking i am very sure that
conscience only kept edward from harley street </s>
<s>   and i really believe
he has the most delicate conscience in the world </s>
<s>  the most scrupulous
in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make
against his interest or pleasure </s>
<s>   he is the most fearful of giving
pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish
of any body i ever saw </s>

<s>   what </s>
<s> 
are you never to hear yourself praised </s>
<s> then you must be no friend of
mine </s>
<s>  for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to
my open commendation </s>
<s> 

the nature of her commendation in the present case however happened
to be particularly illsuited to the feelings of two thirds of her
auditors and was so very unexhilarating to edward that he very soon
got up to go away </s>
<s> 

going so soon </s>
<s>  said marianne </s>
<s>  my dear edward this must not be </s>
<s> 

and drawing him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that lucy
could not stay much longer </s>
<s>   but even this encouragement failed for he
would go </s>
<s>  and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted
two hours soon afterwards went away </s>
<s> 

what can bring her here so often </s>
<s>  said marianne on her leaving them </s>
<s> 
could not she see that we wanted her gone </s>
<s> how teazing to edward </s>
<s> 

why so </s>
<s> we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known
to him of any </s>
<s>   it is but natural that he should like to see her as
well as ourselves </s>
<s> 

marianne looked at her steadily and said you know elinor that this
is a kind of talking which i cannot bear </s>
<s>   if you only hope to have
your assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case you
ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it </s>
<s>   i
cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not really
wanted </s>
<s> 

she then left the room </s>
<s>  and elinor dared not follow her to say more
for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to lucy she could give
no information that would convince marianne </s>
<s>  and painful as the
consequences of her still continuing in an error might be she was
obliged to submit to it </s>
<s>   all that she could hope was that edward
would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing
mariannes mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meetingand this she had every
reason to expect </s>

chapter 


within a few days after this meeting the newspapers announced to the
world that the lady of thomas palmer esq </s>
<s>  was safely delivered of a
son and heir </s>
<s>  a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before </s>
<s> 

this event highly important to <abvr> jenningss happiness produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her time and influenced in a
like degree the engagements of her young friends </s>
<s>  for as she wished to
be as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning as
soon as she was dressed and did not return till late in the evening </s>
<s> 
and the miss dashwoods at the particular request of the middletons
spent the whole of every day in conduit street </s>
<s>  for their own comfort
they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in <abvr>
jenningss house </s>
<s>  but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes
of everybody </s>
<s>  their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton and
the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact was as little
valued as it was professedly sought </s>
<s> 

they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former </s>
<s>  and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye as intruding on
their ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize </s>
<s> 
though nothing could be more polite than lady middletons behaviour to
elinor and marianne she did not really like them at all </s>
<s>   because they
neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them
goodnatured </s>
<s>  and because they were fond of reading she fancied them
satirical </s>
<s>  perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical </s>
<s> 
but that did not signify </s>
<s>   it was censure in common use and easily
given </s>
<s> 

their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy </s>
<s>   it checked the
idleness of one and the business of the other </s>
<s>   lady middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times she feared they would
despise her for offering </s>
<s>   miss steele was the least discomposed of the
three by their presence </s>
<s>  and it was in their power to reconcile her to
it entirely </s>
<s>   would either of them only have given her a full and
minute account of the whole affair between marianne and <abvr> willoughby
she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned </s>
<s> 
but this conciliation was not granted </s>
<s>  for though she often threw out
expressions of pity for her sister to elinor and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect was
produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in
the latter </s>
<s>   an effort even yet lighter might have made her their
friend </s>
<s>   would they only have laughed at her about the doctor </s>
<s>   but so
little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that
if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kind
enough to bestow on herself </s>
<s> 

all these jealousies and discontents however were so totally
unsuspected by <abvr> jennings that she thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together </s>
<s>  and generally congratulated her young
friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long </s>
<s>   she joined them sometimes at sir johns sometimes at
her own house </s>
<s>  but wherever it was she always came in excellent
spirits full of delight and importance attributing charlottes well
doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail
of her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire </s>
<s> 
one thing did disturb her </s>
<s>  and of that she made her daily complaint </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  palmer maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sex
of all infants being alike </s>
<s>  and though she could plainly perceive at
different times the most striking resemblance between this baby and
every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his
father of it </s>
<s>  no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like
every other baby of the same age </s>
<s>  nor could he even be brought to
acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
world </s>
<s> 

i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time
befell <abvr> john dashwood </s>
<s>   it so happened that while her two sisters
with <abvr> jennings were first calling on her in harley street another
of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her </s>
<s>   but while the imaginations
of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances ones happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance </s>
<s>   in the present
instance this lastarrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss
dashwoods and understanding them to be <abvr> dashwoods sisters she
immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street </s>
<s>  and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister to a small
musical party at her house </s>
<s>   the consequence of which was that <abvr>
john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what
was still worse must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention </s>
<s>  and who could tell that they might not
expect to go out with her a second time </s>
<s>   the power of disappointing
them it was true must always be hers </s>
<s>   but that was not enough </s>
<s>  for
when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
them </s>
<s> 

marianne had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit of
going out every day that it was become a matter of indifference to
her whether she went or not </s>
<s>  and she prepared quietly and mechanically
for every evenings engagement though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last
moment where it was to take her </s>
<s> 

to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent as
not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her
toilet which it received from miss steele in the first five minutes of
their being together when it was finished </s>
<s>   nothing escaped her minute
observation and general curiosity </s>
<s>  she saw every thing and asked every
thing </s>
<s>  was never easy till she knew the price of every part of
mariannes dress </s>
<s>  could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether
with better judgment than marianne herself and was not without hopes
of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself </s>
<s>   the
impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover was generally
concluded with a compliment which though meant as its douceur was
considered by marianne as the greatest impertinence of all </s>
<s>  for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the
colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair she was almost
sure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart and she
dared to say she would make a great many conquests </s>
<s> 

with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present
occasion to her brothers carriage </s>
<s>  which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sisterinlaw who had preceded them to the house of
her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman </s>
<s> 

the events of this evening were not very remarkable </s>
<s>   the party like
other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at all </s>
<s> 
and the performers themselves were as usual in their own estimation
and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in
england </s>
<s> 

as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so she made no
scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it
suited her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and
violoncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room </s>
<s>   in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of
young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpickcases
at grays </s>
<s>   she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and
speaking familiarly to her brother </s>
<s>  and had just determined to find out
his name from the latter when they both came towards her and <abvr>
dashwood introduced him to her as <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s> 

he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow
which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was
exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy </s>
<s>   happy
had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his
own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations </s>
<s>   for then his
brothers bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
illhumour of his mother and sister would have begun </s>
<s>   but while she
wondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find that
the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other </s>
<s>   why they were different robert
exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hours
conversation </s>
<s>  for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme
gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper
society he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education </s>
<s> 
while he himself though probably without any particular any material
superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man </s>
<s> 

upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more </s>
<s>  and so i often
tell my mother when she is grieving about it </s>
<s>   my dear madam i
always say to her you must make yourself easy </s>
<s>   the evil is now
irremediable and it has been entirely your own doing </s>
<s>   why would you
be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to
place edward under private tuition at the most critical time of his
life </s>
<s>   if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself
instead of sending him to <abvr> pratts all this would have been
prevented </s>
<s>  this is the way in which i always consider the matter and
my mother is perfectly convinced of her error </s>
<s> 

elinor would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be her
general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not
think of edwards abode in <abvr> pratts family with any satisfaction </s>
<s> 

you reside in devonshire i thinkwas his next observation in a
cottage near dawlish </s>
<s> 

elinor set him right as to its situation </s>
<s>  and it seemed rather
surprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire without living
near dawlish </s>
<s>   he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their
species of house </s>
<s> 

for my own part said he i am excessively fond of a cottage </s>
<s>  there
is always so much comfort so much elegance about them </s>
<s>   and i protest
if i had any money to spare i should buy a little land and build one
myself within a short distance of london where i might drive myself
down at any time and collect a few friends about me and be happy </s>
<s>   i
advise every body who is going to build to build a cottage </s>
<s>   my friend
lord courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice
and laid before me three different plans of bonomis </s>
<s>   i was to decide
on the best of them </s>
<s>   my dear courtland said i immediately throwing
them all into the fire do not adopt either of them but by all means
build a cottage </s>
<s>  and that i fancy will be the end of it </s>
<s> 

some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space in a
cottage </s>
<s>  but this is all a mistake </s>
<s>   i was last month at my friend
elliotts near dartford </s>
<s>   lady elliott wished to give a dance </s>
<s>   but
how can it be done </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  my dear ferrars do tell me how it is
to be managed </s>
<s>   there is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
couple and where can the supper be </s>
<s>  i immediately saw that there
could be no difficulty in it so i said my dear lady elliott do not
be uneasy </s>
<s>   the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease </s>
<s> 
cardtables may be placed in the drawingroom </s>
<s>  the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments </s>
<s>  and let the supper be set out in the
saloon </s>
<s>   lady elliott was delighted with the thought </s>
<s>   we measured the
diningroom and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan </s>
<s>   so that in fact you
see if people do but know how to set about it every comfort may be as
well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling </s>
<s> 

elinor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the
compliment of rational opposition </s>
<s> 

as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister
his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else </s>
<s>  and a thought
struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for
her approbation when they got home </s>
<s>   the consideration of <abvr>
dennisons mistake in supposing his sisters their guests had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such
while <abvr> jenningss engagements kept her from home </s>
<s>   the expense would
be nothing the inconvenience not more </s>
<s>  and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his
father </s>
<s>   fanny was startled at the proposal </s>
<s> 

i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting lady
middleton for they spend every day with her </s>
<s>  otherwise i should be
exceedingly glad to do it </s>
<s>   you know i am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews </s>
<s>   but
they are lady middletons visitors </s>
<s>   how can i ask them away from her </s>
<s> 

her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her
objection </s>
<s>   they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit
street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations </s>
<s> 

fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said

my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power </s>
<s> 
but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a
few days with us </s>
<s>   they are very well behaved good kind of girls </s>
<s>  and
i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well
by edward </s>
<s>   we can ask your sisters some other year you know </s>
<s>  but the
miss steeles may not be in town any more </s>
<s>   i am sure you will like
them </s>
<s>  indeed you do like them you know very much already and so
does my mother </s>
<s>  and they are such favourites with harry </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwood was convinced </s>
<s>   he saw the necessity of inviting the miss
steeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his sisters another year </s>
<s>  at the same time however slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by
bringing elinor to town as colonel brandons wife and marianne as
their visitor </s>
<s> 

fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it wrote the next morning to lucy to request her company and
her sisters for some days in harley street as soon as lady
middleton could spare them </s>
<s>   this was enough to make lucy really and
reasonably happy </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood seemed actually working for her
herself </s>
<s>  cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views </s>
<s>   such
an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all
things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the
most gratifying to her feelings </s>
<s>   it was an advantage that could not be
too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of </s>
<s>  and the
visit to lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits
was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days
time </s>
<s> 

when the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival it gave her for the first time some share in the
expectations of lucy </s>
<s>  for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwill
towards her arose from something more than merely malice against
herself </s>
<s>  and might be brought by time and address to do every thing
that lucy wished </s>
<s>   her flattery had already subdued the pride of lady
middleton and made an entry into the close heart of <abvr> john
dashwood </s>
<s>  and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater </s>
<s> 

the miss steeles removed to harley street and all that reached elinor
of their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event </s>
<s> 
sir john who called on them more than once brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in as must be universally striking </s>
<s>   <abvr>
dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her
life as she was with them </s>
<s>  had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant </s>
<s>  called lucy by her christian name </s>
<s>  and did not know
whether she should ever be able to part with them </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother felt
it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her </s>
<s>  and
contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from
that period to her own home and her own habits in which she found the
miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share </s>
<s> 

about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
berkeley street <abvr> jennings on returning from her ordinary visit to
mrs </s>
<s>  palmer entered the drawingroom where elinor was sitting by
herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to
hear something wonderful </s>
<s>  and giving her time only to form that idea
began directly to justify it by saying

lord </s>
<s>  my dear miss dashwood </s>
<s>  have you heard the news </s>
<s> 

no maam </s>
<s>   what is it </s>
<s> 

something so strange </s>
<s>   but you shall hear it all </s>
<s>  when i got to <abvr>
palmers i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child </s>
<s>   she was
sure it was very illit cried and fretted and was all over pimples </s>
<s> 
so i looked at it directly and lord </s>
<s>  my dear says i it is
nothing in the world but the red gum and nurse said just the same </s>
<s> 
but charlotte she would not be satisfied so <abvr> donavan was sent for </s>
<s> 
and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he
stepped over directly and as soon as ever mama he said
just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and
then charlotte was easy </s>
<s>   and so just as he was going away again it
came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of
it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news </s>
<s>   so upon
that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know
something or other and at last he said in a whisper for fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sisters indisposition i think it advisable to say that i
believe there is no great reason for alarm </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> dashwood will
do very well </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  is fanny ill </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i said my dear </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  says i is <abvr>
dashwood ill </s>
<s>  so then it all came out </s>
<s>  and the long and the short of
the matter by all i can learn seems to be this </s>
<s>   <abvr> edward ferrars
the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it
turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it <abvr>
edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
cousin lucy </s>
<s> theres for you my dear </s>
<s> and not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter except nancy </s>
<s> could you have believed such a
thing possible </s>
<s>  there is no great wonder in their liking one another </s>
<s> 
but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody
suspect it </s>
<s> that is strange </s>
<s> i never happened to see them together
or i am sure i should have found it out directly </s>
<s>   well and so this
was kept a great secret for fear of <abvr> ferrars and neither she nor
your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter </s>
<s> till this very
morning poor nancy who you know is a wellmeaning creature but no
conjurer popt it all out </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  thinks she to herself they are
all so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it </s>
<s> 
and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her
carpetwork little suspecting what was to comefor she had just been
saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to
make a match between edward and some lords daughter or other i forget
who </s>
<s>   so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride </s>
<s> 
she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as
reached your brothers ears as he was sitting in his own dressingroom
down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the
country </s>
<s>   so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for
lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on </s>
<s> 
poor soul </s>
<s>   i pity her </s>
<s>   and i must say i think she was used very
hardly </s>
<s>  for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into
a fainting fit </s>
<s>   nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly </s>
<s> 
and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know
what to do </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood declared they should not stay a minute
longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his
knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up
their clothes </s>
<s>   then she fell into hysterics again and he was so
frightened that he would send for <abvr> donavan and <abvr> donavan found
the house in all this uproar </s>
<s>   the carriage was at the door ready to
take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came
off </s>
<s>  poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk </s>
<s>  and
nancy she was almost as bad </s>
<s>   i declare i have no patience with your
sister </s>
<s>  and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of
her </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  what a taking poor <abvr> edward will be in when he hears of
it </s>
<s>   to have his love used so scornfully </s>
<s>  for they say he is monstrous
fond of her as well he may </s>
<s>   i should not wonder if he was to be in
the greatest passion </s>
<s> and <abvr> donavan thinks just the same </s>
<s>   he and i
had a great deal of talk about it </s>
<s>  and the best of all is that he is
gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when <abvr>
ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins
left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too </s>
<s> 
and so she may for what i care </s>
<s>   i have no pity for either of them </s>
<s>   i
have no notion of peoples making such a todo about money and
greatness </s>
<s>   there is no reason on earth why <abvr> edward and lucy should
not marry </s>
<s>  for i am sure <abvr> ferrars may afford to do very well by her
son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than
any body how to make the most of every thing </s>
<s>  i dare say if <abvr>
ferrars would only allow him five hundred ayear she would make as
good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s> 
how snug they might live in such another cottage as yoursor a little
biggerwith two maids and two men </s>
<s>  and i believe i could help them to
a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit
them exactly </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> jennings ceased and as elinor had had time enough to collect
her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such
observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce </s>
<s> 
happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it </s>
<s>  that <abvr> jennings as she had of late often hoped might be the
case had ceased to imagine her at all attached to edward </s>
<s>  and happy
above all the rest in the absence of marianne she felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment and to give her judgment
as she believed with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it </s>
<s> 

she could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really
was </s>
<s>  though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and
lucy </s>
<s>   what <abvr> ferrars would say and do though there could not be a
doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear </s>
<s>  and still more anxious to
know how edward would conduct himself </s>
<s>   for him she felt much
compassion </s>
<s> for lucy very littleand it cost her some pains to
procure that little </s>
<s> for the rest of the party none at all </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> jennings could talk on no other subject elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing marianne for its discussion </s>
<s>   no time was to be
lost in undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truth
and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister or any
resentment against edward </s>
<s> 

elinors office was a painful one </s>
<s> she was going to remove what she
really believed to be her sisters chief consolationto give such
particulars of edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good
opinionand to make marianne by a resemblance in their situations
which to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own disappointment
over again </s>
<s>   but unwelcome as such a task must be it was necessary to
be done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it </s>
<s> 

she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings or to
represent herself as suffering much any otherwise than as the
selfcommand she had practised since her first knowledge of edwards
engagement might suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne </s>
<s> 
her narration was clear and simple </s>
<s>  and though it could not be given
without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor
impetuous grief </s>
<s> that belonged rather to the hearer for marianne
listened with horror and cried excessively </s>
<s>   elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her own distresses no less than in theirs </s>
<s>  and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure
of mind and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but
of imprudence was readily offered </s>
<s> 

but marianne for some time would give credit to neither </s>
<s>   edward seemed
a second willoughby </s>
<s>  and acknowledging as elinor did that she had
loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself </s>
<s>   as for
lucy steele she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man that she could not be persuaded
at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of
edward for her </s>
<s>   she would not even admit it to have been natural </s>
<s>  and
elinor left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only
could convince her a better knowledge of mankind </s>
<s> 

her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement and the length of time it had existed </s>
<s> mariannes
feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of
detail </s>
<s>  and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her
distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment </s>
<s>   the first
question on her side which led to farther particulars was

how long has this been known to you elinor </s>
<s>  has he written to you </s>
<s> 

i have known it these four months </s>
<s>   when lucy first came to barton
park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement </s>
<s> 

at these words mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment which her
lips could not utter </s>
<s>   after a pause of wonder she exclaimed

four months </s>
<s> have you known of this four months </s>
<s> 

elinor confirmed it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s> while attending me in all my misery has this been on your
heart </s>
<s> and i have reproached you for being happy </s>
<s> 

it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse </s>
<s> 

four months </s>
<s> cried marianne again </s>
<s> so calm </s>
<s> so cheerful </s>
<s> how
have you been supported </s>
<s> 

by feeling that i was doing my duty </s>
<s> my promise to lucy obliged me
to be secret </s>
<s>   i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of
the truth </s>
<s>  and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in
them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to
satisfy </s>
<s> 

marianne seemed much struck </s>
<s> 

i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother added
elinor </s>
<s>  and once or twice i have attempted it </s>
<s> but without betraying
my trust i never could have convinced you </s>
<s> 

four months </s>
<s> and yet you loved him </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but i did not love only him </s>
<s> and while the comfort of others was
dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt </s>
<s> 
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion </s>
<s>   i would not have
you suffer on my account </s>
<s>  for i assure you i no longer suffer
materially myself </s>
<s>   i have many things to support me </s>
<s>   i am not
conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my
own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther </s>
<s> 
i acquit edward of essential misconduct </s>
<s>   i wish him very happy </s>
<s>  and i
am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour
some regret in the end he must become so </s>
<s>   lucy does not want sense
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built </s>
<s> and
after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a
single and constant attachment and all that can be said of ones
happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not
meantit is not fitit is not possible that it should be so </s>
<s>  edward
will marry lucy </s>
<s>  he will marry a woman superior in person and
understanding to half her sex </s>
<s>  and time and habit will teach him to
forget that he ever thought another superior to her </s>
<s> 

if such is your way of thinking said marianne if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your
resolution your selfcommand are perhaps a little less to be
wondered at </s>
<s> they are brought more within my comprehension </s>
<s> 

i understand you </s>
<s> you do not suppose that i have ever felt much </s>
<s> for
four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature </s>
<s>  knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least </s>
<s>  it was told
meit was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose
prior engagement ruined all my prospects </s>
<s>  and told me as i thought
with triumph </s>
<s>  this persons suspicions therefore i have had to
oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most
deeply interested </s>
<s> and it has not been only once </s>
<s> i have had her
hopes and exultation to listen to again and again </s>
<s>  i have known
myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one
circumstance that could make me less desire the connection </s>
<s> nothing
has proved him unworthy </s>
<s>  nor has anything declared him indifferent to
me </s>
<s>  i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and
the insolence of his mother </s>
<s>  and have suffered the punishment of an
attachment without enjoying its advantages </s>
<s>  and all this has been
going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only
unhappiness </s>
<s>  if you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you
may suppose that i have suffered now </s>
<s>   the composure of mind with which
i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the
consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of
constant and painful exertion </s>
<s> they did not spring up of
themselves </s>
<s> they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first </s>
<s>  no
marianne </s>
<s> then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing
could have kept me entirelynot even what i owed to my dearest
friendsfrom openly shewing that i was very unhappy </s>
<s> 

marianne was quite subdued </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  elinor she cried you have made me hate myself for ever </s>
<s> how
barbarous have i been to you </s>
<s> you who have been my only comfort who
have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only
suffering for me </s>
<s> is this my gratitude </s>
<s> is this the only return i can
make you </s>
<s> because your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying
to do it away </s>
<s> 

the tenderest caresses followed this confession </s>
<s>   in such a frame of
mind as she was now in elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her
whatever promise she required </s>
<s>  and at her request marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness </s>
<s> to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her </s>
<s> and even to see edward himself if chance should bring
them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality </s>
<s>  these
were great concessions </s>
<s> but where marianne felt that she had injured
no reparation could be too much for her to make </s>
<s> 

she performed her promise of being discreet to admiration </s>
<s> she
attended to all that <abvr> jennings had to say upon the subject with an
unchanging complexion dissented from her in nothing and was heard
three times to say yes maam </s>
<s> she listened to her praise of lucy
with only moving from one chair to another and when <abvr> jennings
talked of edwards affection it cost her only a spasm in her
throat </s>
<s> such advances towards heroism in her sister made elinor feel
equal to any thing herself </s>
<s> 

the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their
brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair and bring them news of his wife </s>
<s> 

you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity as soon as
he was seated of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday </s>
<s> 

they all looked their assent </s>
<s>  it seemed too awful a moment for speech </s>
<s> 

your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars
tooin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut i
will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
quite overcome </s>
<s>   poor fanny </s>
<s>  she was in hysterics all yesterday </s>
<s>   but i
would not alarm you too much </s>
<s>   donavan says there is nothing materially
to be apprehended </s>
<s>  her constitution is a good one and her resolution
equal to any thing </s>
<s>   she has borne it all with the fortitude of an
angel </s>
<s>   she says she never shall think well of anybody again </s>
<s>  and one
cannot wonder at it after being so deceived </s>
<s> meeting with such
ingratitude where so much kindness had been shewn so much confidence
had been placed </s>
<s>   it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart
that she had asked these young women to her house </s>
<s>  merely because she
thought they deserved some attention were harmless wellbehaved
girls and would be pleasant companions </s>
<s>  for otherwise we both wished
very much to have invited you and marianne to be with us while your
kind friend there was attending her daughter </s>
<s>   and now to be so
rewarded </s>
<s>   i wish with all my heart says poor fanny in her
affectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead of them </s>
<s> 

here he stopped to be thanked </s>
<s>  which being done he went on </s>
<s> 

what poor <abvr> ferrars suffered when first fanny broke it to her is
not to be described </s>
<s>   while she with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him was it to be supposed that
he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person </s>
<s> such a
suspicion could never have entered her head </s>
<s>   if she suspected any
prepossession elsewhere it could not be in that quarter </s>
<s>   there to
be sure said she i might have thought myself safe </s>
<s>  she was quite
in an agony </s>
<s>   we consulted together however as to what should be
done and at last she determined to send for edward </s>
<s>   he came </s>
<s>   but i
am sorry to relate what ensued </s>
<s>   all that <abvr> ferrars could say to
make him put an end to the engagement assisted too as you may well
suppose by my arguments and fannys entreaties was of no avail </s>
<s> 
duty affection every thing was disregarded </s>
<s>   i never thought edward
so stubborn so unfeeling before </s>
<s>   his mother explained to him her
liberal designs in case of his marrying miss morton </s>
<s>  told him she
would settle on him the norfolk estate which clear of landtax
brings in a good thousand ayear </s>
<s>  offered even when matters grew
desperate to make it twelve hundred </s>
<s>  and in opposition to this if he
still persisted in this low connection represented to him the certain
penury that must attend the match </s>
<s>   his own two thousand pounds she
protested should be his all </s>
<s>  she would never see him again </s>
<s>  and so far
would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he
were to enter into any profession with a view of better support she
would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it </s>
<s> 

here marianne in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands
together and cried gracious god </s>
<s>   can this be possible </s>
<s> 

well may you wonder marianne replied her brother at the obstinacy
which could resist such arguments as these </s>
<s>   your exclamation is very
natural </s>
<s> 

marianne was going to retort but she remembered her promises and
forbore </s>
<s> 

all this however he continued was urged in vain </s>
<s>   edward said
very little </s>
<s>  but what he did say was in the most determined manner </s>
<s> 
nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement </s>
<s>   he would
stand to it cost him what it might </s>
<s> 

then cried <abvr> jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be
silent he has acted like an honest man </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon <abvr>
dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a
rascal </s>
<s>   i have some little concern in the business as well as
yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good
husband </s>
<s> 

john dashwood was greatly astonished </s>
<s>  but his nature was calm not open
to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially
anybody of good fortune </s>
<s>   he therefore replied without any resentment

i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours
madam </s>
<s>   miss lucy steele is i dare say a very deserving young woman
but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible </s>
<s> 
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her
uncles care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
as <abvr> ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary </s>
<s>  in
short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
you have a regard for <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   we all wish her extremely happy </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> ferrarss conduct throughout the whole has been such as every
conscientious good mother in like circumstances would adopt </s>
<s>   it has
been dignified and liberal </s>
<s>   edward has drawn his own lot and i fear
it will be a bad one </s>
<s> 

marianne sighed out her similar apprehension </s>
<s>  and elinors heart wrung
for the feelings of edward while braving his mothers threats for a
woman who could not reward him </s>
<s> 

well sir said <abvr> jennings and how did it end </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to say maam in a most unhappy rupture </s>
<s>  edward is
dismissed for ever from his mothers notice </s>
<s>   he left her house
yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do
not know </s>
<s>  for we of course can make no inquiry </s>
<s> 

poor young man </s>
<s> and what is to become of him </s>
<s> 

what indeed maam </s>
<s>   it is a melancholy consideration </s>
<s>   born to the
prospect of such affluence </s>
<s>   i cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable </s>
<s>   the interest of two thousand poundshow can a man live on
it </s>
<s> and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for
his own folly within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand five hundred ayear for miss morton has thirty thousand
pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition </s>
<s>   we must
all feel for him </s>
<s>  and the more so because it is totally out of our
power to assist him </s>
<s> 

poor young man </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings i am sure he should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house </s>
<s>  and so i would tell him if i
could see him </s>
<s>   it is not fit that he should be living about at his own
charge now at lodgings and taverns </s>
<s> 

elinors heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though she
could not forbear smiling at the form of it </s>
<s> 

if he would only have done as well by himself said john dashwood
as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been
in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing </s>
<s>   but as it
is it must be out of anybodys power to assist him </s>
<s>   and there is one
thing more preparing against him which must be worse than allhis
mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle
that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edwards on
proper conditions </s>
<s>   i left her this morning with her lawyer talking
over the business </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jennings that is her revenge </s>
<s>   everybody has a way
of their own </s>
<s>   but i dont think mine would be to make one son
independent because another had plagued me </s>
<s> 

marianne got up and walked about the room </s>
<s> 

can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man continued john
than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might
have been his own </s>
<s>   poor edward </s>
<s>   i feel for him sincerely </s>
<s> 

a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion concluded his
visit </s>
<s>  and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really
believed there was no material danger in fannys indisposition and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away </s>
<s> 
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion as far at least as it regarded <abvr> ferrarss conduct the
dashwoods and edwards </s>
<s> 

mariannes indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room </s>
<s>  and
as her vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor and unnecessary in
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was very warm in her praise of edwards conduct but only
elinor and marianne understood its true merit </s>
<s>   they only knew how
little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was the
consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain
to him in the loss of friends and fortune </s>
<s>   elinor gloried in his
integrity </s>
<s>  and marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his
punishment </s>
<s>   but though confidence between them was by this public
discovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on which
either of them were fond of dwelling when alone </s>
<s>   elinor avoided it
upon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the
too warm too positive assurances of marianne that belief of edwards
continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away </s>
<s>  and
mariannes courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic
which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by the
comparison it necessarily produced between elinors conduct and her own </s>
<s> 

she felt all the force of that comparison </s>
<s>  but not as her sister had
hoped to urge her to exertion now </s>
<s>  she felt it with all the pain of
continual selfreproach regretted most bitterly that she had never
exerted herself before </s>
<s>  but it brought only the torture of penitence
without the hope of amendment </s>
<s>   her mind was so much weakened that she
still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only
dispirited her more </s>
<s> 

nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards of affairs
in harley street or bartletts buildings </s>
<s>   but though so much of the
matter was known to them already that <abvr> jennings might have had
enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after
more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and
inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could </s>
<s>  and nothing but the
hindrance of more visitors than usual had prevented her going to them
within that time </s>
<s> 

the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so
fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardens
though it was only the second week in march </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings and elinor
were of the number </s>
<s>  but marianne who knew that the willoughbys were
again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather
to stay at home than venture into so public a place </s>
<s> 

an intimate acquaintance of <abvr> jennings joined them soon after they
entered the gardens and elinor was not sorry that by her continuing
with them and engaging all <abvr> jenningss conversation she was
herself left to quiet reflection </s>
<s>   she saw nothing of the willoughbys
nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her </s>
<s>   but at last
she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele who
though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings left her own party for a short time to join theirs </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings immediately whispered to elinor

get it all out of her my dear </s>
<s>   she will tell you any thing if you
ask </s>
<s>   you see i cannot leave <abvr> clarke </s>
<s> 

it was lucky however for <abvr> jenningss curiosity and elinors too
that she would tell any thing without being asked </s>
<s>  for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt </s>
<s> 

i am so glad to meet you </s>
<s>  said miss steele taking her familiarly by
the armfor i wanted to see you of all things in the world </s>
<s>   and
then lowering her voice i suppose <abvr> jennings has heard all about
it </s>
<s>   is she angry </s>
<s> 

not at all i believe with you </s>
<s> 

that is a good thing </s>
<s>   and lady middleton is she angry </s>
<s> 

i cannot suppose it possible that she should be </s>
<s> 

i am monstrous glad of it </s>
<s>   good gracious </s>
<s>   i have had such a time of
it </s>
<s>   i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life </s>
<s>   she vowed at first
she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me
again so long as she lived </s>
<s>  but now she is quite come to and we are
as good friends as ever </s>
<s>   look she made me this bow to my hat and put
in the feather last night </s>
<s>   there now you are going to laugh at me
too </s>
<s>   but why should not i wear pink ribbons </s>
<s>   i do not care if it is
the doctors favourite colour </s>
<s>   i am sure for my part i should never
have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not
happened to say so </s>
<s>   my cousins have been so plaguing me </s>
<s>   i declare
sometimes i do not know which way to look before them </s>
<s> 

she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to say
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to
the first </s>
<s> 

well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say what
they chuse about <abvr> ferrarss declaring he would not have lucy for it
is no such thing i can tell you </s>
<s>  and it is quite a shame for such
illnatured reports to be spread abroad </s>
<s>   whatever lucy might think
about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set
it down for certain </s>
<s> 

i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure you
said elinor </s>
<s> 

oh did not you </s>
<s>   but it was said i know very well and by more than
one </s>
<s>  for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could
expect <abvr> ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty
thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at
all </s>
<s>  and i had it from miss sparks myself </s>
<s>   and besides that my cousin
richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid <abvr>
ferrars would be off </s>
<s>  and when edward did not come near us for three
days i could not tell what to think myself </s>
<s>  and i believe in my heart
lucy gave it up all for lost </s>
<s>  for we came away from your brothers
wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and
saturday and did not know what was become of him </s>
<s>   once lucy thought
to write to him but then her spirits rose against that </s>
<s>   however this
morning he came just as we came home from church </s>
<s>  and then it all came
out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been
talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before
them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he
have </s>
<s>   and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as
he had went away from his mothers house he had got upon his horse
and rid into the country some where or other </s>
<s>  and how he had stayed
about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better
of it </s>
<s>   and after thinking it all over and over again he said it
seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it
would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must
be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no
hope of any thing else </s>
<s>  and if he was to go into orders as he had some
thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live
upon that </s>
<s> he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so
he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the
matter directly and leave him shift for himself </s>
<s>   i heard him say all
this as plain as could possibly be </s>
<s>   and it was entirely for her sake
and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon
his own </s>
<s>   i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired
of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it </s>
<s>   but
to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking </s>
<s>  so she
told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know
and all thatoh la </s>
<s>  one cant repeat such kind of things you
knowshe told him directly she had not the least mind in the world
to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so
ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know
or something of the kind </s>
<s>   so then he was monstrous happy and talked
on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take
orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living </s>
<s> 
and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from
below to tell me <abvr> richardson was come in her coach and would take
one of us to kensington gardens </s>
<s>  so i was forced to go into the room
and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did
not care to leave edward </s>
<s>  so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of
silk stockings and came off with the richardsons </s>
<s> 

i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinor </s>
<s> 
you were all in the same room together were not you </s>
<s> 

no indeed not us </s>
<s>   la </s>
<s>  miss dashwood do you think people make love
when any body else is by </s>
<s>   oh for shame </s>
<s> to be sure you must know
better than that </s>
<s>   laughing affectedly </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s>  they were shut up in
the drawingroom together and all i heard was only by listening at the
door </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s>  cried elinor </s>
<s>  have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door </s>
<s>   i am sorry i did not know it
before </s>
<s>  for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself </s>
<s>   how could you behave so unfairly by your sister </s>
<s> 

oh la </s>
<s>  there is nothing in that </s>
<s>   i only stood at the door and heard
what i could </s>
<s>   and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me </s>
<s> 
for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets
together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a
chimneyboard on purpose to hear what we said </s>
<s> 

elinor tried to talk of something else </s>
<s>  but miss steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind </s>
<s> 

edward talks of going to oxford soon said she </s>
<s>  but now he is
lodging at no </s>
<s>   pall mall </s>
<s>   what an illnatured woman his mother is
ant she </s>
<s>  and your brother and sister were not very kind </s>
<s>  however i
shant say anything against them to you </s>
<s>  and to be sure they did send
us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for </s>
<s>   and
for my part i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us
for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before </s>
<s>  but however
nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight </s>
<s> 
edward have got some business at oxford he says </s>
<s>  so he must go there
for a time </s>
<s>  and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he
will be ordained </s>
<s>   i wonder what curacy he will get </s>
<s> good gracious </s>
<s> 
giggling as she spoke id lay my life i know what my cousins will
say when they hear of it </s>
<s>   they will tell me i should write to the
doctor to get edward the curacy of his new living </s>
<s>   i know they will </s>
<s> 
but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world </s>
<s>  la </s>
<s>  i
shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a thing </s>
<s>   i
write to the doctor indeed </s>
<s> 

well said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst </s>
<s> 
you have got your answer ready </s>
<s> 

miss steele was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of
her own party made another more necessary </s>
<s> 

oh la </s>
<s>  here come the richardsons </s>
<s>   i had a vast deal more to say to

such was her parting concern </s>
<s>  for after this she had time only to pay
her farewell compliments to <abvr> jennings before her company was
claimed by <abvr> richardson </s>
<s>  and elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though
she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
foreplanned in her own mind </s>
<s>   edwards marriage with lucy was as firmly
determined on and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
uncertain as she had concluded it would be </s>
<s> every thing depended
exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment of

<s> 

as soon as they returned to the carriage <abvr> jennings was eager for
information </s>
<s>  but as elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she
confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as
she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would
choose to have known </s>
<s>   the continuance of their engagement and the
means that were able to be taken for promoting its end was all her
communication </s>

natural remark </s>

<s> ay we all know how that will
end </s>
<s> they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it

chapter 


the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town
and mariannes impatience to be gone increased every day </s>
<s>   she sighed
for the air the liberty the quiet of the country </s>
<s>  and fancied that if
any place could give her ease barton must do it </s>
<s>   elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey which marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge </s>
<s>   she began however seriously to turn her thoughts
towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her
goodwill when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer appeared to elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other </s>
<s>  the palmers were to remove to cleveland about
the end of march for the easter holidays </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings with both
her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with
them </s>
<s>   this would not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy
of miss dashwood </s>
<s> but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
mr </s>
<s>  palmer himself as joined to the very great amendment of his
manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy
induced her to accept it with pleasure </s>
<s> 

when she told marianne what she had done however her first reply was
not very auspicious </s>
<s> 

cleveland </s>
<s> she cried with great agitation </s>
<s>   no i cannot go to
cleveland </s>
<s> 

you forget said elinor gently that its situation is not </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that it
is not in the neighbourhood of </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

but it is in somersetshire </s>
<s> i cannot go into somersetshire </s>
<s> there
where i looked forward to going </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> no elinor you cannot expect me to
go there </s>
<s> 

elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings </s>
<s> she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others </s>
<s> represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the
time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to
see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan
could do and perhaps without any greater delay </s>
<s>   from cleveland which
was within a few miles of bristol the distance to barton was not
beyond one day though a long days journey </s>
<s>  and their mothers servant
might easily come there to attend them down </s>
<s>  and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks time </s>
<s>   as mariannes affection
for her mother was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty
over the imaginary evils she had started </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was so far from being weary of her guests that she
pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from cleveland </s>
<s> 
elinor was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her
design </s>
<s>  and their mothers concurrence being readily gained every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be </s>
<s> and
marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her from barton </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss
dashwoods </s>
<s> was <abvr> jenningss address to him when he first called on
her after their leaving her was settledfor they are quite resolved
upon going home from the palmers </s>
<s> and how forlorn we shall be when i
come back </s>
<s> lord </s>
<s>  we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
cats </s>
<s> 

perhaps <abvr> jennings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give
himself an escape from it </s>
<s> and if so she had soon afterwards good
reason to think her object gained </s>
<s>  for on elinors moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print which she
was going to copy for her friend he followed her to it with a look of
particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes </s>
<s> 
the effect of his discourse on the lady too could not escape her
observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even
changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear to one close by
the piano forte on which marianne was playing she could not keep
herself from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with
agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her
employment </s>
<s>  still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the
interval of mariannes turning from one lesson to another some words
of the colonels inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his house </s>
<s>   this set the matter beyond a
doubt </s>
<s>   she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do so </s>
<s> 
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette </s>
<s>   what elinor said in reply
she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that
she did not think that any material objection </s>
<s> and <abvr> jennings
commended her in her heart for being so honest </s>
<s>   they then talked on
for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another
lucky stop in mariannes performance brought her these words in the
colonels calm voice

i am afraid it cannot take place very soon </s>
<s> 

astonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech she was almost
ready to cry out lord </s>
<s>  what should hinder it </s>
<s> but checking her
desire confined herself to this silent ejaculation </s>
<s> 

this is very strange </s>
<s> sure he need not wait to be older </s>
<s> 

this delay on the colonels side however did not seem to offend or
mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards and moving different ways <abvr> jennings
very plainly heard elinor say and with a voice which shewed her to
feel what she said

i shall always think myself very much obliged to you </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was delighted with her gratitude and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence the colonel should be able to take leave
of them as he immediately did with the utmost sangfroid and go away
without making her any reply </s>
<s> she had not thought her old friend could
have made so indifferent a suitor </s>
<s> 

what had really passed between them was to this effect </s>
<s> 

i have heard said he with great compassion of the injustice your
friend <abvr> ferrars has suffered from his family </s>
<s>  for if i understand
the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his engagement with a very deserving young woman </s>
<s>  have i been
rightly informed </s>
<s> is it so </s>
<s> 

elinor told him that it was </s>
<s> 

the cruelty the impolitic crueltyhe replied with great
feelingof dividing or attempting to divide two young people long
attached to each other is terrible </s>
<s>  <abvr> ferrars does not know what
she may be doingwhat she may drive her son to </s>
<s>   i have seen <abvr>
ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with
him </s>
<s>   he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
in a short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his
own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more </s>
<s>   i understand
that he intends to take orders </s>
<s>   will you be so good as to tell him
that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this
days post is his if he think it worth his acceptancebut that
perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be
nonsense to appear to doubt </s>
<s>  i only wish it were more  valuable </s>
<s>  it
is a rectory but a small one </s>
<s>  the late incumbent i believe did not
make more than  l per annum and though it is certainly capable of
improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very
comfortable income </s>
<s>   such as it is however my pleasure in presenting
it to him will be very great </s>
<s>   pray assure him of it </s>
<s> 

elinors astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand </s>
<s> 
the preferment which only two days before she had considered as
hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to marry </s>
<s> and
she of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it </s>
<s> her
emotion was such as <abvr> jennings had attributed to a very different
cause </s>
<s> but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might
have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence
and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together
prompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmly
expressed </s>
<s>   she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke of
edwards principles and disposition with that praise which she knew
them to deserve </s>
<s>  and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another </s>
<s>   but at the same time she could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself </s>
<s>   it was an office in short
from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared
herself </s>
<s>  but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy declining
it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her
means that she would not on any account make farther opposition </s>
<s> 
edward she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heard
his address from miss steele </s>
<s>   she could undertake therefore to inform
him of it in the course of the day </s>
<s>   after this had been settled
colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that he
mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent </s>
<s> an
evil which elinor as <abvr> jennings had supposed her to do made very
light of at least as far as regarded its size </s>
<s> 

the smallness of the house said she i cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and
income </s>
<s> 

by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering <abvr>
ferrarss marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation </s>
<s>  for
he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such
an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle
onand he said so </s>
<s> 

this little rectory can do no more than make <abvr> ferrars comfortable
as a bachelor </s>
<s>  it cannot enable him to marry </s>
<s>   i am sorry to say that
my patronage ends with this </s>
<s>  and my interest is hardly more extensive </s>
<s> 
if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do
if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i
could be at present </s>
<s>   what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all
since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal
his only object of happiness </s>
<s>   his marriage must still be a distant
good </s>
<s> at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon </s>
<s> 

such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the
delicate feelings of <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  but after this narration of what
really passed between colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at
the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may
perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage </s>

chapter 


well miss dashwood said <abvr> jennings sagaciously smiling as soon
as the gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel has
been saying to you </s>
<s>  for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of
hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business </s>
<s> 
and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life and i wish you
joy of it with all my heart </s>
<s> 

thank you maam said elinor </s>
<s>   it is a matter of great joy to me </s>
<s> 
and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly </s>
<s>   there are
not many men who would act as he has done </s>
<s>   few people who have so
compassionate a heart </s>
<s>   i never was more astonished in my life </s>
<s> 

lord </s>
<s>  my dear you are very modest </s>
<s>   i ant the least astonished at it
in the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more
likely to happen </s>
<s> 

you judged from your knowledge of the colonels general benevolence </s>
<s> 
but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
soon occur </s>
<s> 

opportunity </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> jenningsoh </s>
<s>  as to that when a man has
once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon
find an opportunity </s>
<s>   well my dear i wish you joy of it again and
again </s>
<s>  and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i
shall soon know where to look for them </s>
<s> 

you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose said elinor with a
faint smile </s>
<s> 

aye my dear that i do indeed </s>
<s>   and as to the house being a bad one
i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as
ever i saw </s>
<s> 

he spoke of its being out of repair </s>
<s> 

well and whose fault is that </s>
<s>  why dont he repair it </s>
<s> who should do
it but himself </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the
carriage being at the door </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings immediately preparing to
go said

well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out </s>
<s> 
but however we may have it all over in the evening </s>
<s>  for we shall be
quite alone </s>
<s>   i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind
is too full of the matter to care for company </s>
<s>  and besides you must
long to tell your sister all about it </s>
<s> 

marianne had left the room before the conversation began </s>
<s> 

certainly maam i shall tell marianne of it </s>
<s>  but i shall not mention
it at present to any body else </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  very well said <abvr> jennings rather disappointed </s>
<s>   then you
would not have me tell it to lucy for i think of going as far as
holborn today </s>
<s> 

no maam not even lucy if you please </s>
<s>   one days delay will not be
very material </s>
<s>  and till i have written to <abvr> ferrars i think it ought
not to be mentioned to any body else </s>
<s>   i shall do that directly </s>
<s>   it is
of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of
course have much to do relative to his ordination </s>
<s> 

this speech at first puzzled <abvr> jennings exceedingly </s>
<s>   why <abvr>
ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry she could
not immediately comprehend </s>
<s>   a few moments reflection however
produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed </s>
<s> 

oh ho </s>
<s> i understand you </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is to be the man </s>
<s>   well so
much the better for him </s>
<s>   ay to be sure he must be ordained in
readiness </s>
<s>  and i am very glad to find things are so forward between
you </s>
<s>   but my dear is not this rather out of character </s>
<s>   should not
the colonel write himself </s>
<s> sure he is the proper person </s>
<s> 

elinor did not quite understand the beginning of <abvr> jenningss
speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into </s>
<s>  and therefore
only replied to its conclusion </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to
announce his intentions to <abvr> ferrars than himself </s>
<s> 

and so you are forced to do it </s>
<s>   well that is an odd kind of delicacy </s>
<s> 
however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write </s>
<s>   you
know your own concerns best </s>
<s>   so goodby my dear </s>
<s>   i have not heard of
any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed </s>
<s> 

and away she went </s>
<s>  but returning again in a moment

i have just been thinking of bettys sister my dear </s>
<s>   i should be
very glad to get her so good a mistress </s>
<s>   but whether she would do for
a ladys maid i am sure i cant tell </s>
<s>   she is an excellent housemaid
and works very well at her needle </s>
<s>   however you will think of all that
at your leisure </s>
<s> 

certainly maam replied elinor not hearing much of what she said
and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject </s>
<s> 

how she should beginhow she should express herself in her note to
edward was now all her concern </s>
<s>   the particular circumstances between
them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
been the easiest thing in the world </s>
<s>  but she equally feared to say too
much or too little and sat deliberating over her paper with the pen
in her hand till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself </s>
<s> 

he had met <abvr> jennings at the door in her way to the carriage as he
came to leave his farewell card </s>
<s>  and she after apologising for not
returning herself had obliged him to enter by saying that miss
dashwood was above and wanted to speak with him on very particular
business </s>
<s> 

elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her
perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her
upon this greatest exertion of all </s>
<s>   her astonishment and confusion
were very great on his so sudden appearance </s>
<s>   she had not seen him
before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his
knowing her to be acquainted with it </s>
<s>  which with the consciousness of
what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes </s>
<s>   he too was much
distressed </s>
<s>  and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment </s>
<s> whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on
first coming into the room he could not recollect </s>
<s>  but determining to
be on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he could
say any thing after taking a chair </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings told me said he that you wished to speak with me at
least i understood her soor i certainly should not have intruded on
you in such a manner </s>
<s>  though at the same time i should have been
extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister </s>
<s> 
especially as it will most likely be some timeit is not probable that
i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again </s>
<s>   i go to oxford
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself
and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as
possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been
able to give them in person </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings was quite right in what she
said </s>
<s>   i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on
the point of communicating by paper </s>
<s>   i am charged with a most
agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke </s>
<s> 
colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to
say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure
in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes
it were more valuable </s>
<s>   allow me to congratulate you on having so
respectable and welljudging a friend and to join in his wish that the
livingit is about two hundred ayearwere much more considerable
and such as might better enable you toas might be more than a
temporary accommodation to yourselfsuch in short as might establish
all your views of happiness </s>
<s> 

what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected
that any one else should say for him </s>
<s>   he looked all the astonishment
which such unexpected such unthoughtof information could not fail of
exciting </s>
<s>  but he said only these two words

colonel brandon </s>
<s> 

yes continued elinor gathering more resolution as some of the
worst was over colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern
for what has lately passedfor the cruel situation in which the
unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed youa concern which i
am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share </s>
<s>  and
likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and
his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon give me a living </s>
<s> can it be possible </s>
<s> 

the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
friendship any where </s>
<s> 

no replied he with sudden consciousness not to find it in you </s>
<s> 
for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it
all </s>
<s> i feel iti would express it if i couldbut as you well know
i am no orator </s>
<s> 

you are very much mistaken </s>
<s>   i do assure you that you owe it entirely
at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandons
discernment of it </s>
<s>   i have had no hand in it </s>
<s>   i did not even know
till i understood his design that the living was vacant </s>
<s>  nor had it
ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift </s>
<s> 
as a friend of mine of my family he may perhapsindeed i know he
has still greater pleasure in bestowing it </s>
<s>  but upon my word you owe
nothing to my solicitation </s>
<s> 

truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but
she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation </s>
<s>  which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently
entered it </s>
<s>   for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had
ceased to speak </s>
<s> at last and as if it were rather an effort he said

colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability </s>
<s>   i have
always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him
highly </s>
<s>   he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly
the gentleman </s>
<s> 

indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him on farther
acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be
such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost
close to the mansionhouse it is particularly important that he
should be all this </s>
<s> 

edward made no answer </s>

that </s>
<s> 

really said elinor i know so little of these kind of forms that i
can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation

ordination </s>

two or three months </s>

you talk of it </s>

bless me </s>

the deception could not continue after this </s>

aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she after the first
ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may
be out of repair </s>

you too that had been used to live in barton cottage </s>

ridiculous </s>

thing to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy
goes to it </s>

being enough to allow them to marry </s>

the colonel is a ninny my dear </s>

chapter 


edward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with
his happiness to lucy </s>
<s>  and such was the excess of it by the time he
reached bartletts buildings that she was able to assure <abvr>
jennings who called on her again the next day with her
congratulations that she had never seen him in such spirits before in
her life </s>
<s> 

her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain </s>
<s>  and
she joined <abvr> jennings most heartily in her expectation of their
being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas </s>
<s> 
so far was she at the same time from any backwardness to give elinor
that credit which edward would give her that she spoke of her
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to
own all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on miss dashwoods part either present or future would
ever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she really valued </s>
<s>   as for colonel brandon she was
not only ready to worship him as a saint but was moreover truly
anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns </s>
<s> 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost </s>
<s>  and scarcely
resolved to avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly could
of his servants his carriage his cows and his poultry </s>
<s> 

it was now above a week since john dashwood had called in berkeley
street and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his
wifes indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her a visit </s>
<s> this was an obligation however
which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her companions </s>
<s>   marianne not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to
prevent her sisters going at all </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings though her
carriage was always at elinors service so very much disliked <abvr>
john dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after
the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking
edwards part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company
again </s>
<s>   the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run
the risk of a teteatete with a woman whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was denied </s>
<s>  but before the carriage could turn from the
house her husband accidentally came out </s>
<s>   he expressed great pleasure
in meeting elinor told her that he had been just going to call in
berkeley street and assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see
her invited her to come in </s>

they walked up stairs in to the drawingroom </s>

world to seeing you </s>

favourites </s>

elinor made what excuse she could for her </s>

i am not sorry to see you alone he replied for i have a good deal
to say to you </s>

coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it </s>

it is perfectly true </s>
<s> colonel brandon has given the living of
delaford to edward </s>
<s> 

really </s>
<s> well this is very astonishing </s>
<s> no relationship </s>
<s> no
connection between them </s>
<s> and now that livings fetch such a
price </s>
<s> what was the value of this </s>
<s> 

about two hundred a year </s>
<s> 

very welland for the next presentation to a living of that
valuesupposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and
likely to vacate it soonhe might have got i dare sayfourteen
hundred pounds </s>
<s>   and how came he not to have settled that matter before
this persons death </s>
<s> now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a
man of colonel brandons sense </s>
<s> i wonder he should be so improvident
in a point of such common such natural concern </s>
<s> well i am convinced
that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
character </s>
<s>   i suppose howeveron recollectionthat the case may
probably be this </s>
<s>   edward is only to hold the living till the person to
whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to
take it </s>
<s> aye aye that is the fact depend upon it </s>
<s> 

elinor contradicted it however very positively </s>
<s>  and by relating that
she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel
brandon to edward and therefore must understand the terms on which
it was given obliged him to submit to her authority </s>
<s> 

it is truly astonishing </s>
<s> he cried after hearing what she
saidwhat could be the colonels motive </s>
<s> 

a very simple oneto be of use to <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky
man </s>
<s> you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though i
have broke it to her and she bears it vastly wellshe will not like
to hear it much talked of </s>
<s> 

elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she
thought fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth
to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly
impoverished </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject knows nothing about it at present and i believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may
be </s>
<s>  when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all </s>
<s> 

but why should such precaution be used </s>
<s> though it is not to be
supposed that <abvr> ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her son has money enough to live uponfor that must be
quite out of the question </s>
<s>  yet why upon her late behaviour is she
supposed to feel at all </s>
<s> she has done with her son she cast him off
for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast
him off likewise </s>
<s>   surely after doing so she cannot be imagined
liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his accountshe cannot
be interested in any thing that befalls him </s>
<s>  she would not be so weak
as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of
a parent </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  elinor said john your reasoning is very good but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature </s>
<s>   when edwards unhappy match
takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had
never discarded him </s>
<s>  and therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as
possible </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars can never forget that edward is her son </s>
<s> 

you surprise me </s>
<s>  i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory
by this time </s>
<s> 

you wrong her exceedingly </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world </s>
<s> 

elinor was silent </s>
<s> 

we think nowsaid <abvr> dashwood after a short pause of roberts
marrying miss morton </s>
<s> 

elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brothers
tone calmly replied

the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair </s>
<s> 

choice </s>
<s> how do you mean </s>
<s> 

i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be
the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert </s>
<s> 

certainly there can be no difference </s>
<s>  for robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son </s>
<s> and as to any
thing else they are both very agreeable young men </s>
<s>  i do not know that
one is superior to the other </s>
<s> 

elinor said no more and john was also for a short time silent </s>
<s> his
reflections ended thus </s>
<s> 

of one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand and speaking in
an awful whisperi may assure you </s>
<s> and i will do it because i know
it must gratify you </s>
<s>   i have good reason to thinkindeed i have it
from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut i have it from the
very best authoritynot that i ever precisely heard <abvr> ferrars say
it herselfbut her daughter did and i have it from herthat in
short whatever objections there might be against a certaina certain
connectionyou understand meit would have been far preferable to
her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does </s>
<s>   i
was exceedingly pleased to hear that <abvr> ferrars considered it in that
lighta very gratifying circumstance you know to us all </s>
<s>   it would
have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and
she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse </s>
<s>  but however all
that is quite out of the questionnot to be thought of or
mentionedas to any attachment you knowit never could beall that
is gone by </s>
<s>   but i thought i would just tell you of this because i
knew how much it must please you </s>
<s>   not that you have any reason to
regret my dear elinor </s>
<s>   there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
wellquite as well or better perhaps all things considered </s>
<s>   has
colonel brandon been with you lately </s>
<s> 

elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her
selfimportance to agitate her nerves and fill her mind </s>
<s> and she was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her
brother by the entrance of <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s>   after a few moments
chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of her
sisters being there quitted the room in quest of her </s>
<s>  and elinor was
left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay
unconcern the happy selfcomplacency of his manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his mothers love and liberality to the prejudice
of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of
life and that brothers integrity was confirming her most
unfavourable opinion of his head and heart </s>
<s> 

they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to
speak of edward </s>
<s>  for he too had heard of the living and was very
inquisitive on the subject </s>
<s>   elinor repeated the particulars of it as
she had given them to john </s>
<s>  and their effect on robert though very
different was not less striking than it had been on him </s>
<s>   he laughed
most immoderately </s>
<s>   the idea of edwards being a clergyman and living
in a small parsonagehouse diverted him beyond measure </s>
<s> and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of edward reading prayers in a
white surplice and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith
and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous </s>
<s> 

elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the
conclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed
on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited </s>
<s>   it was a
look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings
and gave no intelligence to him </s>
<s>   he was recalled from wit to wisdom
not by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility </s>
<s> 

we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
of the momentbut upon my soul it is a most serious business </s>
<s>   poor
edward </s>
<s>   he is ruined for ever </s>

know him to be a very goodhearted creature </s>

upon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom </s>

and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life as
when it all burst forth </s>
<s>   i could not believe it </s>
<s>  my mother was the
first person who told me of it </s>
<s>  and i feeling myself called on to act
with resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know
what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must
say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him
again </s>
<s>  that was what i said immediately </s>
<s>  i was most uncommonly
shocked indeed </s>
<s> poor edward </s>
<s> he has done for himself
completelyshut himself out for ever from all decent society </s>
<s> but as
i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it </s>
<s> 
from his style of education it was always to be expected </s>
<s>   my poor
mother was half frantic </s>
<s> 

have you ever seen the lady </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in
for ten minutes </s>

<s>   the merest awkward
country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty </s>
<s> 
i remember her perfectly </s>
<s>   just the kind of girl i should suppose
likely to captivate poor edward </s>
<s>   i offered immediately as soon as my
mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade
him from the match </s>
<s>  but it was too late then i found to do any thing
for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it
till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you
know to interfere </s>
<s>   but had i been informed of it a few hours
earlieri think it is most probablethat something might have been
hit on </s>
<s>   i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very
strong light </s>
<s>   my dear fellow i should have said consider what you
are doing </s>
<s>   you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a
one as your family are unanimous in disapproving </s>
<s>  i cannot help
thinking in short that means might have been found </s>
<s>   but now it is
all too late </s>
<s>   he must be starved you know </s>
<s> that is certain </s>
<s> 
absolutely starved </s>
<s> 

he had just settled this point with great composure when the entrance
of <abvr> john dashwood put an end to the subject </s>
<s>   but though she never
spoke of it out of her own family elinor could see its influence on
her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she
entered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself </s>
<s>   she
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that elinor and her
sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of
them </s>
<s> an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the
room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every
thing that was most affectionate and graceful </s>

chapter 


one other short call in harley street in which elinor received her
brothers congratulations on their travelling so far towards barton
without any expense and on colonel brandons being to follow them to
cleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and
sisters in town </s>
<s> and a faint invitation from fanny to come to norland
whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things was
the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public
assurance from john to elinor of the promptitude with which he should
come to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the
country </s>
<s> 

it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send
her to delaford </s>
<s> a place in which of all others she would now least
chuse to visit or wish to reside </s>
<s>  for not only was it considered as
her future home by her brother and <abvr> jennings but even lucy when
they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there </s>
<s> 

very early in april and tolerably early in the day the two parties
from hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respective
homes to meet by appointment on the road </s>
<s>   for the convenience of
charlotte and her child they were to be more than two days on their
journey and <abvr> palmer travelling more expeditiously with colonel
brandon was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival </s>
<s> 

marianne few as had been her hours of comfort in london and eager as
she had long been to quit it could not when it came to the point bid
adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those
hopes and that confidence in willoughby which were now extinguished
for ever without great pain </s>
<s>   nor could she leave the place in which
willoughby remained busy in new engagements and new schemes in which
she could have no share without shedding many tears </s>

elinors satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive </s>

she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on she left
no creature behind from whom it would give her a moments regret to be
divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the
persecution of lucys friendship she was grateful for bringing her
sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage and she looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at barton might
do towards restoring mariannes peace of mind and confirming her own </s>
<s> 

their journey was safely performed </s>
<s>   the second day brought them into
the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was
it dwelt on by turns in mariannes imagination </s>
<s>  and in the forenoon of
the third they drove up to cleveland </s>
<s> 

cleveland was a spacious modernbuilt house situated on a sloping
lawn </s>
<s>   it had no park but the pleasuregrounds were tolerably
extensive </s>
<s>  and like every other place of the same degree of importance
it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smooth
gravel winding round a plantation led to the front the lawn was
dotted over with timber the house itself was under the guardianship of
the fir the mountainash and the acacia and a thick screen of them
altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the
offices </s>
<s> 

marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
consciousness of being only eighty miles from barton and not thirty
from combe magna </s>
<s>  and before she had been five minutes within its
walls while the others were busily helping charlotte to show her child
to the housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through the
winding shrubberies now just beginning to be in beauty to gain a
distant eminence </s>
<s>  where from its grecian temple her eye wandering
over a wide tract of country to the southeast could fondly rest on
the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and fancy that from their
summits combe magna might be seen </s>
<s> 

in such moments of precious invaluable misery she rejoiced in tears
of agony to be at cleveland </s>
<s>  and as she returned by a different circuit
to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of
wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude she
resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained
with the palmers in the indulgence of such solitary rambles </s>
<s> 

she returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house
on an excursion through its more immediate premises </s>
<s>  and the rest of
the morning was easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen
garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the
gardeners lamentations upon blights in dawdling through the
greenhouse where the loss of her favourite plants unwarily exposed
and nipped by the lingering frost raised the laughter of
charlotteand in visiting her poultryyard where in the
disappointed hopes of her dairymaid by hens forsaking their nests or
being stolen by a fox or in the rapid decrease of a promising young
brood she found fresh sources of merriment </s>
<s> 

the morning was fine and dry and marianne in her plan of employment
abroad had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
at cleveland </s>
<s>   with great surprise therefore did she find herself
prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner </s>
<s>   she had
depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple and perhaps all over
the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred
her from it </s>
<s>  but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walking </s>
<s> 

their party was small and the hours passed quietly away </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
had her child and <abvr> jennings her carpetwork </s>
<s>  they talked of the
friends they had left behind arranged lady middletons engagements
and wondered whether <abvr> palmer and colonel brandon would get farther
than reading that night </s>
<s>   elinor however little concerned in it
joined in their discourse </s>
<s>  and marianne who had the knack of finding
her way in every house to the library however it might be avoided by
the family in general soon procured herself a book </s>
<s> 

nothing was wanting on <abvr> palmers side that constant and friendly
good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome </s>
<s>   the
openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of
recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms
of politeness </s>
<s>  her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was
engaging </s>
<s>  her folly though evident was not disgusting because it was
not conceited </s>
<s>  and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh </s>
<s> 

the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner affording
a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to
their conversation which a long morning of the same continued rain had
reduced very low </s>
<s> 

elinor had seen so little of <abvr> palmer and in that little had seen so
much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew
not what to expect to find him in his own family </s>
<s>   she found him
however perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother </s>
<s>  she found him
very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from
being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to <abvr>
jennings and charlotte </s>
<s>   for the rest of his character and habits they
were marked as far as elinor could perceive with no traits at all
unusual in his sex and time of life </s>
<s>   he was nice in his eating
uncertain in his hours </s>
<s>  fond of his child though affecting to slight
it </s>
<s>  and idled away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been
devoted to business </s>
<s>   she liked him however upon the whole much
better than she had expected and in her heart was not sorry that she
could like him no more </s>
<s> not sorry to be driven by the observation of
his epicurism his selfishness and his conceit to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of edwards generous temper simple
taste and diffident feelings </s>

intelligence from colonel brandon who had been into dorsetshire
lately </s>

mr </s>

great deal of the parsonage at delaford described its deficiencies
and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them </s>
<s> his
behaviour to her in this as well as in every other particular his
open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days his
readiness to converse with her and his deference for her opinion
might very well justify <abvr> jenningss persuasion of his attachment

first believed marianne his real favourite to make her suspect it
herself </s>
<s>   but as it was such a notion had scarcely ever entered her
head except by <abvr> jenningss suggestion </s>

believing herself the nicest observer of the two </s>

eyes while <abvr> jennings thought only of his behaviour </s>
<s> and while his
looks of anxious solicitude on mariannes feeling in her head and
throat the beginning of a heavy cold because unexpressed by words

them the quick feelings and needless alarm of a lover </s>

over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them

trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest

shoes and stockingsgiven marianne a cold so violent as though for a
day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself </s>

prescriptions poured in from all quarters and as usual were all
declined </s>

cough and a sore throat a good nights rest was to cure her entirely </s>

to bed to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies </s>

felt no real alarm </s>

a very restless and feverish night however disappointed the
expectation of both </s>

for the palmers apothecary </s>

he came examined his patient and though encouraging miss dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health yet by
pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency and allowing the
word infection to pass his lips gave instant alarm to <abvr> palmer
on her babys account </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings who had been inclined from the
first to think mariannes complaint more serious than elinor now
looked very grave on <abvr> harriss report and confirming charlottes
fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with
her infant </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer though treating their apprehensions as
idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be
withstood </s>
<s>   her departure therefore was fixed on </s>
<s>  and within an hour
after <abvr> harriss arrival she set off with her little boy and his
nurse for the house of a near relation of <abvr> palmers who lived a
few miles on the other side of bath </s>
<s>  whither her husband promised at
her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two </s>
<s>  and whither she was
almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
however with a kindness of heart which made elinor really love her
declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as
marianne remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care
to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from </s>
<s>  and
elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate
desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better
experience in nursing of material use </s>
<s> 

poor marianne languid and low from the nature of her malady and
feeling herself universally ill could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her recovered </s>
<s>  and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced but for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe </s>
<s>  for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home </s>
<s>  and attended
the whole way by a servant of <abvr> jennings were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon </s>
<s>   the little she said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay </s>
<s>  though elinor tried to
raise her spirits and make her believe as she then really believed
herself that it would be a very short one </s>
<s> 

the next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
patient </s>
<s>  she certainly was not better and except that there was no
amendment did not appear worse </s>
<s>   their party was now farther reduced </s>
<s> 
for <abvr> palmer though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and goodnature as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his wife was persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform his
promise of following her </s>
<s>  and while he was preparing to go colonel
brandon himself with a much greater exertion began to talk of going
likewise </s>
<s> here however the kindness of <abvr> jennings interposed most
acceptably </s>
<s>  for to send the colonel away while his love was in so much
uneasiness on her sisters account would be to deprive them both she
thought of every comfort </s>
<s>  and therefore telling him at once that his
stay at cleveland was necessary to herself that she should want him to
play at piquet of an evening while miss dashwood was above with her
sister &c </s>
<s>  she urged him so strongly to remain that he who was
gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not
long even affect to demur </s>
<s>  especially as <abvr> jenningss entreaty was
warmly seconded by <abvr> palmer who seemed to feel a relief to himself
in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise miss
dashwood in any emergence </s>
<s> 

marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements </s>
<s> 
she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of
cleveland away in about seven days from the time of their arrival </s>
<s>   it
gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of <abvr> palmer </s>
<s>  and as it
gave her likewise no concern she never mentioned her name </s>
<s> 

two days passed away from the time of <abvr> palmers departure and her
situation continued with little variation the same </s>
<s>   <abvr> harris who
attended her every day still talked boldly of a speedy recovery and
miss dashwood was equally sanguine </s>
<s>  but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings had determined very early
in the seizure that marianne would never get over it and colonel
brandon who was chiefly of use in listening to <abvr> jenningss
forebodings was not in a state of mind to resist their influence </s>
<s>   he
tried to reason himself out of fears which the different judgment of
the apothecary seemed to render absurd </s>
<s>  but the many hours of each day
in which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for the
admission of every melancholy idea and he could not expel from his
mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more </s>
<s> 

on the morning of the third day however the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away </s>
<s>  for when <abvr> harris arrived he declared
his patient materially better </s>
<s>   her pulse was much stronger and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit </s>
<s>   elinor confirmed
in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness </s>
<s>  rejoicing that in her
letters to her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her
friends in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at cleveland </s>
<s>  and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be able
to travel </s>
<s> 

but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began </s>
<s>  towards the
evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless and
uncomfortable than before </s>
<s>   her sister however still sanguine was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her bed made </s>
<s>  and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed saw her with satisfaction sink at last into a
slumber from which she expected the most beneficial effects </s>
<s>   her
sleep though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it lasted a
considerable time </s>
<s>  and anxious to observe the result of it herself she
resolved to sit with her during the whole of it </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to
bed </s>
<s>  her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating
herself in the housekeepers room and elinor remained alone with
marianne </s>
<s> 

the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed </s>
<s>  and her
sister who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of
posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
which passed her lips was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful
a slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out

is mama coming </s>
<s> 

not yet cried the other concealing her terror and assisting
marianne to lie down again but she will be here i hope before it is
long </s>
<s>   it is a great way you know from hence to barton </s>
<s> 

but she must not go round by london cried marianne in the same
hurried manner </s>
<s>   i shall never see her if she goes by london </s>
<s> 

elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself and while
attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse </s>
<s>   it was lower and
quicker than ever </s>
<s>   and marianne still talking wildly of mama her
alarm increased so rapidly as to determine her on sending instantly
for <abvr> harris and despatching a messenger to barton for her mother </s>
<s> 
to consult with colonel brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance </s>
<s>  and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by
her sister she hastened down to the drawingroom where she knew he
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present </s>
<s> 

it was no time for hesitation </s>
<s>   her fears and her difficulties were
immediately before him </s>
<s>   her fears he had no courage no confidence to
attempt the removal of </s>
<s> he listened to them in silent despondence </s>
<s> but
her difficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion and the service prearranged in his mind

<s> 
elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome </s>
<s>  she thanked him
with brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry off his
servant with a message to <abvr> harris and an order for posthorses

collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch and calculated with exactness the time in which she might
look for his return </s>
<s>   not a moment was lost in delay of any kind </s>
<s>   the
horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel brandon
only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken
too low to reach her ear hurried into the carriage </s>
<s>   it was then about
twelve oclock and she returned to her sisters apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her the rest of the
night </s>
<s>   it was a night of almost equal suffering to both </s>

security </s>

mrs </s>

her mistress had always thought </s>
<s> 

mariannes ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her
mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the
heart of poor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness and wretched for some immediate relief
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every thing had
been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational </s>

not come for some other advice when the formerbut not till after
five oclockarrived </s>
<s>   his opinion however made some little amends
for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to
be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure with a confidence which in a lesser degree was
communicated to elinor </s>
<s>   he promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours and left both the patient and her anxious
attendant more composed than he had found them </s>
<s> 

with strong concern and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid did <abvr> jennings hear in the morning of what had passed </s>
<s> 
her former apprehensions now with greater reason restored left her no
doubt of the event </s>
<s>  and though trying to speak comfort to elinor her
conviction of her sisters danger would not allow her to offer the
comfort of hope </s>
<s>   her heart was really grieved </s>
<s>   the rapid decay the
early death of a girl so young so lovely as marianne must have struck
a less interested person with concern </s>
<s>   on <abvr> jenningss compassion
she had other claims </s>
<s>   she had been for three months her companion was
still under her care and she was known to have been greatly injured
and long unhappy </s>
<s>   the distress of her sister too particularly a
favourite was before her </s>
<s> and as for their mother when <abvr> jennings
considered that marianne might probably be to her what charlotte was to

disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce </s>

quietnot more herselfremained in a heavy stupor </s>
<s>   elinor catching

further advice </s>

more to try some more fresh application of whose success he was as

was almost hopeless </s>
<s>  and in this state she continued till noon
scarcely stirring from her sisters bed her thoughts wandering from
one image of grief one suffering friend to another and her spirits

scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
many weeks of previous indisposition which mariannes disappointment
had brought on </s>

again </s>

indulging a thought of its continuance </s>
<s> and elinor conning over every
injunction of distrust told herself likewise not to hope </s>

half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her </s>

others even arose to confirm it </s>

flattered elinor with signs of amendment </s>

on her with a rational though languid gaze </s>
<s>   anxiety and hope now
oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of <abvr> harris at four oclock </s>
<s> when his assurances
his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his
expectation gave her confidence comfort and tears of joy </s>
<s> 

marianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her
entirely out of danger </s>

partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted

gratitude </s>

look and every breath </s>
<s>   the possibility of a relapse would of course
in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety wasbut when she
saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of
recovery continued and saw marianne at six oclock sink into a quiet

doubt </s>

yet kept them in ignorance </s>
<s> 

at seven oclock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined
mrs </s>

kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating
much </s>
<s> and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of
content as she brought to it was particularly welcome </s>

would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before

elinor had no sense of fatigue no capability of sleep at that moment
about her and she was not to be kept away from her sister an
unnecessary instant </s>

the clock struck eight </s>

convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the
house </s>

almost impossibility of their being already come that she moved into
the adjoining dressingcloset and opened a window shutter to be
satisfied of the truth </s>

deceived her </s>

view </s>

chapter 


elinor starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him obeyed
the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room
and her hand was already on the lock when its action was suspended by
his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather of command than
supplication

<s>   but she had

engaged </s>
<s>   after a moments recollection therefore concluding that

elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever </s>

think that he must be in liquor </s>

impression she immediately rose saying

her think him sincere </s>

and on more reasonable grounds </s>

<s> 

elinor bowed her assent </s>
<s> 

i do not know said he after a pause of expectation on her side and
thoughtfulness on his ownhow you may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me </s>
<s>  perhaps you will hardly think the better of meit is

please me </s>
<s>  and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a

was that my heart should have been so insensible </s>

confess my vanity only was elevated by it </s>
<s>   careless of her happiness
thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had
always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every
means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design

miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him with the most

vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i

it </s>

<s>  and whose mindoh </s>

infinitely superior </s>
<s> 

your indifference however towards that unfortunate girli must say
it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
beyour indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her </s>

not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of
understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours </s>

she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be

ignorance of the worldevery thing was against me </s>

i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it </s>

<s> 
the night following this affairi was to go the next morningwas
spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be </s>
<s>   the
struggle was greatbut it ended too soon </s>
<s>   my affection for marianne
my thorough conviction of her attachment to meit was all insufficient
to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false

myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i
persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained
for me to do </s>
<s>   a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave
devonshire </s>
<s> i was engaged to dine with you on that very day </s>
<s>  some
apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement </s>

whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a
point of long debate </s>
<s>   to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and
i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my
resolution </s>
<s>   in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity

report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in

evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous

<s> i was too much
shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the

morning i was in my carriage </s>

<s> 

elinor made no answer </s>
<s>   her thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent

<s>   the world had made him extravagant and

vanity while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another

its offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed </s>
<s>   each faulty
propensity in leading him to evil had led him likewise to punishment </s>
<s> 
the attachment from which against honour against feeling against
every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no

sake of which he had with little scruple left her sister to misery
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature </s>
<s>   from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the
end of some minutes by willoughby who rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful started up in preparation for going and
said

chapter 


elinor for some time after he left her for some time even after the
sound of his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas widely differing in themselves but of which sadness
was the general result to think even of her sister </s>
<s> 

willoughby he whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most
worthless of men willoughby in spite of all his faults excited a
degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them which made
her think of him as now separated for ever from her family with a
tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she soon acknowledged
within herselfto his wishes than to his merits </s>
<s>   she felt that his
influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
in reason to have weight </s>
<s>  by that person of uncommon attraction that
open affectionate and lively manner which it was no merit to possess </s>
<s> 
and by that still ardent love for marianne which it was not even
innocent to indulge </s>
<s>   but she felt that it was so long long before
she could feel his influence less </s>
<s> 

when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne she found her
just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her hopes </s>
<s>   elinors heart was full </s>
<s>   the past the present the
future willoughbys visit mariannes safety and her mothers
expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue and made her only fearful
of betraying herself to her sister </s>
<s>   short was the time however in
which that fear could affect her for within half an hour after
willoughbys leaving the house she was again called down stairs by the
sound of another carriage </s>
<s> eager to save her mother from every
unnecessary moments horrible suspense she ran immediately into the
hall and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
her as she entered it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of mariannes being no more had no voice to
inquire after her no voice even for elinor </s>
<s>  but she waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief </s>
<s> and her
mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much
overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears </s>
<s>   she
was supported into the drawingroom between her daughter and her
friend </s>
<s> and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to
speak embraced elinor again and again turning from her at intervals
to press colonel brandons hand with a look which spoke at once her
gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
of the moment </s>
<s>   he shared it however in a silence even greater than
her own </s>
<s> 

as soon as <abvr> dashwood had recovered herself to see marianne was her
first desire </s>
<s>  and in two minutes she was with her beloved child
rendered dearer to her than ever by absence unhappiness and danger </s>
<s> 
elinors delight as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther
sleep </s>
<s> but <abvr> dashwood could be calm could be even prudent when
the life of a child was at stake and marianne satisfied in knowing
her mother was near her and conscious of being too weak for
conversation submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood would sit up with her all night </s>
<s> 
and elinor in compliance with her mothers entreaty went to bed </s>
<s>   but
the rest which one night entirely sleepless and many hours of the
most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite was kept off by
irritation of spirits </s>
<s>   willoughby poor willoughby as she now
allowed herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts </s>
<s>  she would
not but have heard his vindication for the world and now blamed now
acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before </s>
<s>   but her
promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful </s>
<s>   she
dreaded the performance of it dreaded what its effect on marianne
might be </s>
<s>  doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be
happy with another </s>
<s>  and for a moment wished willoughby a widower </s>
<s> 
then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself felt that to his
sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rivals the reward
of her sister was due and wished any thing rather than <abvr>
willoughbys death </s>
<s> 

the shock of colonel brandons errand at barton had been much softened
to <abvr> dashwood by her own previous alarm </s>
<s>  for so great was her
uneasiness about marianne that she had already determined to set out
for cleveland on that very day without waiting for any further
intelligence and had so far settled her journey before his arrival
that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch margaret away
as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection </s>
<s> 

marianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant cheerfulness of
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwoods looks and spirits proved her to be as she repeatedly
declared herself one of the happiest women in the world </s>
<s>   elinor could
not hear the declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
dashwood trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment
which elinor had sent her was led away by the exuberance of her joy to
think only of what would increase it </s>
<s>   marianne was restored to her
from a danger in which as she now began to feel her own mistaken
judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to willoughby had
contributed to place her </s>
<s> and in her recovery she had yet another
source of joy unthought of by elinor </s>
<s>   it was thus imparted to her as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred </s>
<s> 

at last we are alone </s>
<s>   my elinor you do not yet know all my
happiness </s>
<s>   colonel brandon loves marianne </s>
<s>   he has told me so himself </s>
<s> 

her daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained surprised and
not surprised was all silent attention </s>
<s> 

you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your
composure now </s>
<s>   had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family i should have fixed on colonel brandons marrying one of you as
the object most desirable </s>
<s>   and i believe marianne will be the most
happy with him of the two </s>
<s> 

elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age
characters or feelings could be given </s>
<s> but her mother must always be
carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject and
therefore instead of an inquiry she passed it off with a smile </s>
<s>

out quite unawares quite undesignedly </s>

<s>  i saw
that it equalled my own and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship

marianne </s>
<s>   he has loved her my elinor ever since the first moment of
seeing her </s>
<s> 

here however elinor perceivednot the language not the professions
of colonel brandon but the natural embellishments of her mothers
active fancy which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose </s>
<s> 

his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby
ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or
constantwhich ever we are to call ithas subsisted through all the
knowledge of dear mariannes unhappy prepossession for that worthless
young man </s>
<s> and without selfishnesswithout encouraging a hope </s>
<s> could
he have seen her happy with anothersuch a noble mind </s>
<s> such openness
such sincerity </s>

colonel brandons character said elinor as an excellent man is
well established </s>
<s> 

i know it isreplied her mother seriously or after such a warning
i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased
by it </s>
<s>   but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready
friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men </s>
<s> 

his character however answered elinor does not rest on one act of

him equally sanguine </s>

no </s>

chapter 


mariannes illness though weakening in its kind had not been long
enough to make her recovery slow </s>
<s>  and with youth natural strength and
her mothers presence in aid it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her
to remove within four days after the arrival of the latter into <abvr>
palmers dressingroom </s>
<s>   when there at her own particular request for
she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her
mother colonel brandon was invited to visit her </s>
<s> 

his emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered looks and in
receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him was
such as in elinors conjecture must arise from something more than
his affection for marianne or the consciousness of its being known to
others </s>
<s>  and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he looked at her sister the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his mind brought back by that resemblance
between marianne and eliza already acknowledged and now strengthened
by the hollow eye the sickly skin the posture of reclining weakness
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood not less watchful of what passed than her daughter but
with a mind very differently influenced and therefore watching to very
different effect saw nothing in the colonels behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and selfevident sensations while in the actions
and words of marianne she persuaded herself to think that something
more than gratitude already dawned </s>
<s> 

at the end of another day or two marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours <abvr> dashwood urged equally by her own and her
daughters wishes began to talk of removing to barton </s>
<s>   on her
measures depended those of her two friends </s>
<s>  <abvr> jennings could not
quit cleveland during the dashwoods stay </s>
<s>  and colonel brandon was soon
brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as
equally determinate if not equally indispensable </s>
<s>   at his and <abvr>
jenningss united request in return <abvr> dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his carriage on her journey back for the better
accommodation of her sick child </s>
<s>  and the colonel at the joint
invitation of <abvr> dashwood and <abvr> jennings whose active goodnature
made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself
engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the
course of a few weeks </s>
<s> 

the day of separation and departure arrived </s>
<s>  and marianne after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of <abvr> jennings one so earnestly
grateful so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding
colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend was carefully
assisted by him into the carriage of which he seemed anxious that she
should engross at least half </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood and elinor then followed
and the others were left by themselves to talk of the travellers and
feel their own dullness till <abvr> jennings was summoned to her chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young
companions </s>
<s>  and colonel brandon immediately afterwards took his
solitary way to delaford </s>
<s> 

the dashwoods were two days on the road and marianne bore her journey
on both without essential fatigue </s>
<s>   every thing that the most zealous
affection the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable
was the office of each watchful companion and each found their reward
in her bodily ease and her calmness of spirits </s>
<s>   to elinor the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful </s>
<s>   she who had seen
her week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of
heart which she had neither courage to speak of nor fortitude to
conceal now saw with a joy which no other could equally share an
apparent composure of mind which in being the result as she trusted
of serious reflection must eventually lead her to contentment and
cheerfulness </s>
<s> 

as they approached barton indeed and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection
she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their
notice sat earnestly gazing through the window </s>
<s>   but here elinor
could neither wonder nor blame </s>
<s>  and when she saw as she assisted
marianne from the carriage that she had been crying she saw only an
emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise </s>
<s>   in the whole of her
subsequent manner she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
reasonable exertion </s>
<s>  for no sooner had they entered their common
sittingroom than marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could be
connected </s>
<s> she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile </s>
<s>   after dinner she would try her pianoforte </s>
<s> 
she went to it </s>
<s>  but the music on which her eye first rested was an
opera procured for her by willoughby containing some of their
favourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his
handwriting </s>
<s> that would not do </s>
<s> she shook her head put the music
aside and after running over the keys for a minute complained of
feebleness in her fingers and closed the instrument again </s>
<s>  declaring
however with firmness as she did so that she should in future practice
much </s>
<s> 

the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms </s>
<s>   on the
contrary with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest she looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of
margarets return and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society as the
only happiness worth a wish </s>
<s> 

when the weather is settled and i have recovered my strength said
she we will take long walks together every day </s>
<s>   we will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on </s>
<s>  we will
walk to sir johns new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland </s>
<s> 
and we will often go to the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its
foundations as far as we are told they once reached </s>
<s>   i know we shall
be happy </s>
<s>   i know the summer will pass happily away </s>
<s>   i mean never to
be later in rising than six and from that time till dinner i shall
divide every moment between music and reading </s>
<s>   i have formed my plan
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study </s>
<s>   our own
library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any thing beyond
mere amusement </s>
<s>   but there are many works well worth reading at the
park </s>
<s>  and there are others of more modern production which i know i can
borrow of colonel brandon </s>
<s>   by reading only six hours aday i shall
gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction which
i now feel myself to want </s>
<s> 

elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this </s>
<s> 
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous selfcontrol </s>
<s>  her smile however changed to a sigh when she
remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled and feared
she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
marianne and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity </s>
<s>   willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved
to wait till her sisters health were more secure before she appointed
it </s>
<s>   but the resolution was made only to be broken </s>
<s> 

marianne had been two or three days at home before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out </s>
<s>   but at last a
soft genial morning appeared </s>
<s>  such as might tempt the daughters
wishes and the mothers confidence </s>
<s>  and marianne leaning on elinors
arm was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue in
the lane before the house </s>
<s> 

the sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness of marianne in an
exercise hitherto untried since her illness required </s>
<s> and they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned
towards it marianne calmly said

there exactly therepointing with one hand on that projecting
moundthere i fell </s>
<s>  and there i first saw willoughby </s>
<s> 

her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added

i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the
spot </s>
<s> shall we ever talk on that subject elinor </s>
<s> hesitatingly it
was said </s>
<s> or will it be wrong </s>
<s> i can talk of it now i hope as i
ought to do </s>

elinor tenderly invited her to be open </s>

concerned </s>
<s>   i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been
for him but what they are now </s>
<s> at present if i could be satisfied on
one point if i could be allowed to think that he was not always acting
a part not always deceiving me </s>
<s> but above all if i could be assured
that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied
him since the story of that unfortunate girl

she stopt </s>
<s>   elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered

if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  my peace of mind is doubly involved in it </s>
<s> for not only is it
horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of
such designsbut what must it make me appear to myself </s>

situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to

very very fickle </s>
<s> 

elinor said no more </s>
<s>   she was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her story directly or postponing it till
marianne were in stronger health </s>
<s> and they crept on for a few minutes
in silence </s>
<s> 

i am not wishing him too much good said marianne at last with a
sigh when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own </s>

no </s>

your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure </s>
<s>   my
illness has made me think it has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection </s>
<s>   long before i was enough recovered to talk i
was perfectly able to reflect </s>
<s>   i considered the past </s>
<s>  i saw in my own
behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
autumn nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself and want of
kindness to others </s>
<s>   i saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave </s>

myself by such negligence of my own health as i had felt even at the
time to be wrong </s>

did not know my danger till the danger was removed </s>

consoled her </s>
<s> i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself </s>
<s>   whenever

indulged </s>

<s>   the kindness the
unceasing kindness of <abvr> jennings i had repaid with ungrateful
contempt </s>
<s>   to the middletons to the palmers the steeles to every
common acquaintance even i had been insolent and unjust </s>

hardened against their merits and a temper irritated by their very
attention </s>
<s> to john to fannyyes even to them little as they
deserve i had given less than their due </s>
<s>   but youyou above all
above my mother had been wronged by me </s>
<s>   i and only i knew your
heart and its sorrows </s>
<s>  yet to what did it influence me </s>
<s> not to any
compassion that could benefit you or myself </s>
<s> your example was before
me </s>

<s> was i more considerate of you and your comfort </s>
<s> 
did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking
any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge

here ceased the rapid flow of her selfreproving spirit </s>

deserved </s>

feelings of the past could not be recalled </s>

could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his

<s>   nothing
could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the
interests of colonel brandon </s>
<s> 

had <abvr> dashwood like her daughter heard willoughbys story from
himselfhad she witnessed his distress and been under the influence
of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion
would have been greater </s>
<s>   but it was neither in elinors power nor in
her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed
explanation as had at first been called forth in herself </s>
<s>   reflection
had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of
willoughbys deserts </s>
<s> she wished therefore to declare only the
simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his
character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray </s>
<s> 

in the evening when they were all three together marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him again </s>
<s> but that it was not without an
effort the restless unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for

slowly continued

it is a great relief to mewhat elinor told me this morningi have

<s> for some moments her voice
was lost </s>
<s>  but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness
than beforei am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change </s>
<s>   i
never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later

marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change </s>
<s> 

you consider the matter said elinor exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it </s>
<s>  and i dare say you perceive as
well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain </s>
<s> 
had you married you must have been always poor </s>
<s>   his expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that
selfdenial is a word hardly understood by him </s>
<s>   his demands and your
inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought
on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having
been entirely unknown and unthought of before </s>
<s>   your sense of honour
and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation
to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible </s>
<s>  and
perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort
you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond thatand how
little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
which had begun before your marriage </s>
<s>  beyond that had you
endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not
to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart
and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such
difficulties </s>
<s> 

mariannes lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish </s>
<s>  in a
tone that implieddo you really think him selfish </s>
<s> 

the whole of his behaviour replied elinor from the beginning to
the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness </s>
<s>   it was
selfishness which first made him sport with your affections </s>
<s>  which
afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of
it and which finally carried him from barton </s>
<s>   his own enjoyment or
his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle </s>
<s> 

it is very true </s>
<s>   my happiness never was his object </s>
<s> 

at present continued elinor he regrets what he has done </s>
<s>   and why
does he regret it </s>
<s> because he finds it has not answered towards
himself </s>
<s>   it has not made him happy </s>
<s>   his circumstances are now
unembarrassedhe suffers from no evil of that kind </s>
<s>  and he thinks only
that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself </s>
<s> 
but does it follow that had he married you he would have been
happy </s>
<s> the inconveniences would have been different </s>
<s>   he would then
have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are
removed he now reckons as nothing </s>
<s>   he would have had a wife of whose
temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always
necessitousalways poor </s>
<s>  and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a
wife </s>
<s> 

i have not a doubt of it said marianne </s>

regretnothing but my own folly </s>

rather say your mothers imprudence my child said <abvr> dashwood </s>

marianne would not let her proceed </s>
<s> and elinor satisfied that each
felt their own error wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her sisters spirits </s>
<s>  she therefore pursuing the first
subject immediately continued

one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the
storythat all willoughbys difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams </s>
<s>   that crime
has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present
discontents </s>

marianne assented most feelingly to the remark </s>

by it to an enumeration of colonel brandons injuries and merits warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate </s>

look however as if much of it were heard by her </s>

elinor according to her expectation saw on the two or three following
days that marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done </s>

cheerful and easy her sister could safely trust to the effect of time

i see <abvr> ferrars myself maam this morning in exeter and his lady
too miss steele as was </s>

the new london inn as i went there with a message from sally at the
park to her brother who is one of the postboys </s>
<s>  i happened to look up
as i went by the chaise and so i see directly it was the youngest miss
steele </s>
<s>  so i took off my hat and she knew me and called to me and
inquired after you maam and the young ladies especially miss
marianne and bid me i should give her compliments and <abvr> ferrarss
their best compliments and service and how sorry they was they had not
time to come on and see you but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards for they was going further down for a little while but
howsever when they come back theyd make sure to come and see you </s>
<s> 

but did she tell you she was married thomas </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  she smiled and said how she had changed her name since
she was in these parts </s>
<s>   she was always a very affable and freespoken
young lady and very civil behaved </s>
<s>   so i made free to wish her joy </s>
<s> 

was <abvr> ferrars in the carriage with her </s>
<s> 

yes maam i just see him leaning back in it but he did not look
up </s>
<s> he never was a gentleman much for talking </s>
<s> 

elinors heart could easily account for his not putting himself
forward </s>
<s>  and <abvr> dashwood probably found the same explanation </s>

was there no one else in the carriage </s>

no maam only they two </s>
<s> 

do you know where they came from </s>
<s> 

they come straight from town as miss lucymrs </s>

yes maambut not to bide long </s>

then theyd be sure and call here </s>

<s>  but elinor knew better than
to expect them </s>
<s>   she recognised the whole of lucy in the message and
was very confident that edward would never come near them </s>
<s>   she
observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going
down to <abvr> pratts near plymouth </s>
<s> 

thomass intelligence seemed over </s>
<s>   elinor looked as if she wished to
hear more </s>
<s> 

did you see them off before you came away </s>

no maamthe horses were just coming out but i could not bide any
longer </s>
<s>  i was afraid of being late </s>
<s> 

did <abvr> ferrars look well </s>

yes maam she said how she was very well </s>

always a very handsome young ladyand she seemed vastly contented </s>

<s>  dashwoods and elinors appetites were equally lost and margaret
might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both
her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals she had never been obliged to go
without her dinner before </s>
<s> 

when the dessert and the wine were arranged and <abvr> dashwood and
elinor were left by themselves they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood feared to
hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation </s>
<s>   she now
found that she had erred in relying on elinors representation of
herself </s>
<s>  and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness
suffering as she then had suffered for marianne </s>
<s>   she found that she
had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her
daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well
understood much slighter in reality than she had been wont to
believe or than it was now proved to be </s>
<s>   she feared that under this
persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her
elinor </s>

immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led

chapter 


elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told to consider it

that he should be married soon before as she imagined he could be in

living surprised her a little at first </s>

him should overlook every thing but the risk of delay </s>

they would soon she supposed be settled at delaford </s>
<s> delafordthat
place in which so much conspired to give her an interest </s>
<s>  which she
wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid </s>

elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in london
would write to them to announce the event and give farther
particularsbut day after day passed off and brought no letter no
tidings </s>
<s>   though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault
with every absent friend </s>
<s>   they were all thoughtless or indolent </s>
<s> 

when do you write to colonel brandon maam </s>
<s>  was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on </s>

i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to
hear from him again </s>

not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day </s>

at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other </s>

path </s>

them </s>

his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for
elinor </s>

fearful of his reception and conscious that he merited no kind one </s>

<s>  dashwood however conforming as she trusted to the wishes of

her hand and wished him joy </s>

he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply </s>
<s>   elinors lips
had moved with her mothers and when the moment of action was over
she wished that she had shaken hands with him too </s>
<s>   but it was then too
late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and
talked of the weather </s>
<s> 

marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her
distress </s>
<s>  and margaret understanding some part but not the whole of
the case thought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore
took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a strict
silence </s>
<s> 

when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very
awful pause took place </s>
<s>   it was put an end to by <abvr> dashwood who
felt obliged to hope that he had left <abvr> ferrars very well </s>

elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own

accent of the utmost amazement </s>

<s>   he
rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not
knowing what to do </s>
<s>  took up a pair of scissors that lay there and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice

his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor

agitation as made her hardly know where she was </s>
<s> 

yes said he they were married last week and are now at dawlish </s>
<s> 

elinor could sit it no longer </s>
<s>   she almost ran out of the room and as
soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first
she thought would never cease </s>
<s>   edward who had till then looked any
where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps sawor even
heard her emotion </s>
<s>  for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie
which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of <abvr>
dashwood could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted
the room and walked out towards the villageleaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so
wonderful and so sudden </s>

lessening but by their own conjectures </s>

chapter 


unaccountable however as the circumstances of his release might
appear to the whole family it was certain that edward was free </s>
<s>  and to
what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily predetermined
by all </s>
<s> for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent
engagement contracted without his mothers consent as he had already
done for more than four years nothing less could be expected of him in
the failure of that than the immediate contraction of another </s>
<s> 

his errand at barton in fact was a simple one </s>
<s>   it was only to ask
elinor to marry him </s>
<s> and considering that he was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air </s>
<s> 

how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how
soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred in what manner he
expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly
told </s>
<s>   this only need be said </s>
<s> that when they all sat down to table at
four oclock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his
lady engaged her mothers consent and was not only in the rapturous
profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one
of the happiest of men </s>
<s>   his situation indeed was more than commonly
joyful </s>
<s>   he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
swell his heart and raise his spirits </s>
<s>   he was released without any
reproach to himself from an entanglement which had long formed his
misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love </s>
<s> and elevated at
once to that security with another which he must have thought of
almost with despair as soon as he had learnt to consider it with
desire </s>
<s>   he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to
happiness </s>
<s> and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine
flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in
him before </s>
<s> 

his heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses all its errors
confessed and his first boyish attachment to lucy treated with all the
philosophic dignity of twentyfour </s>
<s> 

it was a foolish idle inclination on my side said he the
consequence of ignorance of the worldand want of employment </s>
<s>   had my
mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen
from the care of <abvr> pratt i thinknay i am sure it would never
have happened </s>
<s>  for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the
time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had
any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied
attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i
must have done </s>
<s>   but instead of having any thing to do instead of
having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any
myself i returned home to be completely idle </s>
<s>  and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which
belonging to the university would have given me </s>
<s>  for i was not entered
at oxford till i was nineteen </s>
<s>   i had therefore nothing in the world to
do but to fancy myself in love </s>
<s>  and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my
brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to
be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and
was always sure of a welcome </s>
<s>  and accordingly i spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen </s>
<s>  lucy appeared everything
that was amiable and obliging </s>
<s>   she was pretty tooat least i thought
so then </s>
<s>  and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no
comparisons and see no defects </s>
<s>   considering everything therefore i
hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every
way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable
piece of folly </s>
<s> 

the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
of the dashwoods was suchso greatas promised them all the
satisfaction of a sleepless night </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood too happy to be
comfortable knew not how to love edward nor praise elinor enough how
to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both </s>
<s> 

marianne could speak her happiness only by tears </s>
<s>   comparisons would
occurregrets would arise </s>
<s> and her joy though sincere as her love
for her sister was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language </s>
<s> 

but elinorhow are her feelings to be described </s>
<s> from the moment of
learning that lucy was married to another that edward was free to the
moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed she
was every thing by turns but tranquil </s>
<s>   but when the second moment had
passed when she found every doubt every solicitude removed compared
her situation with what so lately it had beensaw him honourably
released from his former engagement saw him instantly profiting by the
release to address herself and declare an affection as tender as
constant as she had ever supposed it to beshe was oppressed she was
overcome by her own felicity </s>
<s> and happily disposed as is the human
mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better it
required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any degree
of tranquillity to her heart </s>
<s> 

edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week </s>
<s> for whatever
other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a
week should be given up to the enjoyment of elinors company or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past the present and
the future </s>
<s> for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is
different </s>
<s>   between them no subject is finished no communication is
even made till it has been made at least twenty times over </s>
<s> 

lucys marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers </s>
<s> and
elinors particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in
every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she had ever heard </s>
<s>   how they could be thrown together
and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry a girl of
whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admirationa
girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that
brother had been thrown off by his familyit was beyond her
comprehension to make out </s>
<s>   to her own heart it was a delightful
affair to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but to her
reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle </s>
<s> 

edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing that perhaps
at first accidentally meeting the vanity of the one had been so worked
on by the flattery of the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest </s>
<s> 
elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street of his
opinion of what his own mediation in his brothers affairs might have
done if applied to in time </s>
<s>   she repeated it to edward </s>
<s> 

that was exactly like robertwas his immediate observation </s>
<s> and
that he presently added might perhaps be in his head when the
acquaintance between them first began </s>
<s>   and lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour </s>
<s>   other designs
might afterward arise </s>
<s> 

how long it had been carrying on between them however he was equally
at a loss with herself to make out </s>
<s>  for at oxford where he had
remained for choice ever since his quitting london he had had no means
of hearing of her but from herself and her letters to the very last
were neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual </s>
<s>   not the
smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred to prepare him for
what followed </s>
<s> and when at last it burst on him in a letter from lucy
herself he had been for some time he believed half stupified between
the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance </s>
<s>   he put the
letter into elinors hands </s>
<s> 

     dear sir

     being very sure i have long lost your affections
     i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
     on another and have no doubt of being as happy with
     him as i once used to think i might be with you </s>
<s> 
     but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
     anothers </s>
<s>   sincerely wish you happy in your choice
     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
     good friends as our near relationship now makes
     proper </s>
<s>   i can safely say i owe you no illwill
     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
     ill offices </s>
<s>   your brother has gained my affections
     entirely and as we could not live without one
     another we are just returned from the altar and
     are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which
     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see
     but thought i would first trouble you with these
     few lines and shall always remain

     your sincere wellwisher friend and sister
                                        lucy ferrars </s>
<s> 

     i have burnt all your letters and will return
     your picture the first opportunity </s>
<s>   please to destroy
     my scrawlsbut the ring with my hair you are very
     welcome to keep </s>
<s> 

elinor read and returned it without any comment </s>
<s> 

i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition said
edward </s>
<s> for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you
in former days </s>
<s> in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife </s>
<s> how i
have blushed over the pages of her writing </s>
<s> and i believe i may say
that since the first half year of our foolishbusinessthis is the
only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me
any amends for the defect of the style </s>
<s> 

however it may have come about said elinor after a pausethey
are certainly married </s>
<s>   and your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment </s>
<s>   the independence she settled on robert
through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own
choice </s>
<s>  and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
ayear to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for
intending to do </s>
<s>   she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by roberts
marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her </s>
<s> 

she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite </s>
<s> she
will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him
much sooner </s>
<s> 

in what state the affair stood at present between them edward knew
not for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted
by him </s>
<s>   he had quitted oxford within four and twenty hours after
lucys letter arrived and with only one object before him the nearest
road to barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct with
which that road did not hold the most intimate connection </s>
<s>   he could do
nothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and by his
rapidity in seeking that fate it is to be supposed in spite of the
jealousy with which he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite of
the modesty with which he rated his own deserts and the politeness
with which he talked of his doubts he did not upon the whole expect
a very cruel reception </s>
<s>   it was his business however to say that he
did and he said it very prettily </s>
<s>   what he might say on the subject a
twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination of husbands and
wives </s>
<s> 

that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish of
malice against him in her message by thomas was perfectly clear to
elinor </s>
<s>  and edward himself now thoroughly enlightened on her
character had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton illnature </s>
<s>  though his eyes had been long opened
even before his acquaintance with elinor began to her ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her opinionsthey had been equally
imputed by him to her want of education </s>
<s>  and till her last letter
reached him he had always believed her to be a welldisposed
goodhearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself </s>
<s>   nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an
engagement which long before the discovery of it laid him open to his
mothers anger had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
him </s>
<s> 

i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings to give
her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was
renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in
the world to assist me </s>
<s>   in such a situation as that where there
seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly
insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but
the most disinterested affection was her inducement </s>
<s>   and even now i
cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage
it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the
smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world </s>
<s> 
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour </s>
<s> 
that your own family might in time relent </s>
<s>   and at any rate she lost
nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it
fettered neither her inclination nor her actions </s>
<s>   the connection was
certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration
among her friends </s>
<s>  and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would
be better for her to marry you than be single </s>
<s> 

edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have
been more natural than lucys conduct nor more selfevident than the
motive of it </s>
<s> 

elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at
norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy </s>
<s> 

your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she </s>
<s>  becauseto say
nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to
fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be </s>
<s> 

he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken
confidence in the force of his engagement </s>
<s> 

i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to
another there could be no danger in my being with you </s>
<s>  and that the
consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
as my honour </s>
<s>   i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only
friendship </s>
<s>  and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and
lucy i did not know how far i was got </s>
<s>   after that i suppose i was
wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i
reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than
these </s>
<s> the danger is my own </s>
<s>  i am doing no injury to anybody but
myself </s>
<s> 

elinor smiled and shook her head </s>
<s> 

edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons being expected at the
cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him
but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented
his giving him the living of delafordwhich at present said he
after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion
he must think i have never forgiven him for offering </s>
<s> 

now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place </s>
<s> 
but so little interest had he taken in the matter that he owed all his
knowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the parish
condition of the land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself who
had heard so much of it from colonel brandon and heard it with so much
attention as to be entirely mistress of the subject </s>
<s> 

one question after this only remained undecided between them one
difficulty only was to be overcome </s>
<s>   they were brought together by
mutual affection with the warmest approbation of their real friends </s>
<s> 
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certainand they only wanted something to live upon </s>
<s>   edward had two
thousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was all
that they could call their own </s>
<s>  for it was impossible that <abvr>
dashwood should advance anything </s>
<s>  and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds ayear
would supply them with the comforts of life </s>
<s> 

edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his
mother towards him </s>
<s>  and on that he rested for the residue of their
income </s>
<s>   but elinor had no such dependence </s>
<s>  for since edward would
still be unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself had been
spoken of in <abvr> ferrarss flattering language as only a lesser evil
than his chusing lucy steele she feared that roberts offence would
serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny </s>
<s> 

about four days after edwards arrival colonel brandon appeared to
complete <abvr> dashwoods satisfaction and to give her the dignity of
having for the first time since her living at barton more company
with her than her house would hold </s>
<s>   edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore walked every
night to his old quarters at the park </s>
<s>  from whence he usually returned
in the morning early enough to interrupt the lovers first teteatete
before breakfast </s>
<s> 

a three weeks residence at delaford where in his evening hours at
least he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirtysix and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in mariannes looks all the kindness
of her welcome and all the encouragement of her mothers language to
make it cheerful </s>
<s>   among such friends however and such flattery he
did revive </s>
<s>   no rumour of lucys marriage had yet reached him </s>
<s> he knew
nothing of what had passed </s>
<s>  and the first hours of his visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering </s>
<s>   every thing was
explained to him by <abvr> dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoice
in what he had done for <abvr> ferrars since eventually it promoted the
interest of elinor </s>
<s> 

it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced in the good
opinion of each other as they advanced in each others acquaintance
for it could not be otherwise </s>
<s>   their resemblance in good principles
and good sense in disposition and manner of thinking would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other
attraction </s>
<s>  but their being in love with two sisters and two sisters
fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment </s>
<s> 

the letters from town which a few days before would have made every
nerve in elinors body thrill with transport now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale to vent her honest indignation against the jilting
girl and pour forth her compassion towards poor <abvr> edward who she
was sure had quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now by all
accounts almost brokenhearted at oxford </s>
<s>  i do think she
continued nothing was ever carried on so sly </s>
<s>  for it was but two days
before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me </s>
<s>   not a soul
suspected anything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul </s>
<s>   came
crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of <abvr> ferrars
as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth </s>
<s>  for lucy it seems
borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on purpose we
suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not seven shillings in
the world </s>
<s> so i was very glad to give her five guineas to take her
down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with
mrs </s>
<s>  burgess in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor
again </s>
<s>   and i must say that lucys crossness not to take them along
with them in the chaise is worse than all </s>
<s>   poor <abvr> edward </s>
<s>  i cannot
get him out of my head but you must send for him to barton and miss
marianne must try to comfort him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwoods strains were more solemn </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars was the most
unfortunate of womenpoor fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibilityand he considered the existence of each under such a
blow with grateful wonder </s>
<s>   roberts offence was unpardonable but
lucys was infinitely worse </s>
<s>   neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  and even if she might hereafter be induced
to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her
daughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence </s>
<s>   the secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion
of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to
prevent the marriage </s>
<s>  and he called on elinor to join with him in
regretting that lucys engagement with edward had not rather been
fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery
farther in the family </s>
<s>  he thus continued </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars has never yet mentioned edwards name which does not
surprise us </s>
<s>  but to our great astonishment not a line has been
received from him on the occasion </s>
<s>   perhaps however he is kept silent
by his fear of offending and i shall therefore give him a hint by a
line to oxford that his sister and i both think a letter of proper
submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny and by her shewn to
her mother might not be taken amiss </s>
<s>  for we all know the tenderness of
mrs </s>
<s>  ferrarss heart and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be
on good terms with her children </s>
<s> 

this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
edward </s>
<s>   it determined him to attempt a reconciliation though not
exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister </s>
<s> 

a letter of proper submission </s>
<s>  repeated he </s>
<s>  would they have me beg
my mothers pardon for roberts ingratitude to her and breach of
honour to me </s>
<s> i can make no submissioni am grown neither humble nor
penitent by what has passed </s>
<s> i am grown very happy </s>
<s>  but that would not
interest </s>
<s> i know of no submission that is proper for me to make </s>
<s> 

you may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because you have
offended </s>
<s> and i should think you might now venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mothers anger </s>
<s> 

he agreed that he might </s>
<s> 

and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be
convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent
in her eyes as the first </s>
<s> 

he had nothing to urge against it but still resisted the idea of a
letter of proper submission </s>
<s>  and therefore to make it easier to him
as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead of writing
to fanny he should go to london and personally intreat her good
offices in his favour </s>
<s>  and if they really do interest themselves
said marianne in her new character of candour in bringing about a
reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely
without merit </s>
<s> 

after a visit on colonel brandons side of only three or four days the
two gentlemen quitted barton together </s>
<s>  they were to go immediately to
delaford that edward might have some personal knowledge of his future
home and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements
were needed to it </s>

nights he was to proceed on his journey to town </s>

chapter 


after a proper resistance on the part of <abvr> ferrars just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always
seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable edward
was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son </s>
<s> 

her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating </s>
<s>   for many years of
her life she had had two sons </s>
<s>  but the crime and annihilation of edward
a few weeks ago had robbed her of one </s>
<s>  the similar annihilation of
robert had left her for a fortnight without any </s>
<s>  and now by the
resuscitation of edward she had one again </s>
<s> 

in spite of his being allowed once more to live however he did not
feel the continuance of his existence secure till he had revealed his
present engagement </s>
<s>  for the publication of that circumstance he
feared might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry him off
as rapidly as before </s>
<s>   with apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed and he was listened to with unexpected calmness </s>
<s>   <abvr>
ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying
miss dashwood by every argument in her power </s>
<s> told him that in miss
morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune </s>
<s> and
enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was only
the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three </s>
<s>  but when
she found that though perfectly admitting the truth of her
representation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it she
judged it wisest from the experience of the past to submitand
therefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own
dignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of goodwill she
issued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor </s>
<s> 

what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
be considered </s>
<s>  and here it plainly appeared that though edward was now
her only son he was by no means her eldest </s>
<s>  for while robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear not the smallest
objection was made against edwards taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost </s>
<s>  nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future beyond the ten thousand pounds which had
been given with fanny </s>
<s> 

it was as much however as was desired and more than was expected by
edward and elinor </s>
<s>  and <abvr> ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses
seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more </s>
<s> 

with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them
they had nothing to wait for after edward was in possession of the
living but the readiness of the house to which colonel brandon with
an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor was making
considerable improvements </s>
<s>  and after waiting some time for their
completion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor
as usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready and the ceremony took place in barton
church early in the autumn </s>
<s> 

the first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
mansionhouse </s>
<s>  from whence they could superintend the progress of the
parsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spot </s>
<s> could
chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep </s>
<s>   <abvr> jenningss
prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled </s>
<s>  for
she was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage by
michaelmas and she found in elinor and her husband as she really
believed one of the happiest couples in the world </s>
<s>   they had in fact
nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel brandon and marianne
and rather better pasturage for their cows </s>
<s> 

they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
and friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was
almost ashamed of having authorised </s>
<s>  and even the dashwoods were at the
expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour </s>
<s> 

i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister said john as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of delaford
house that would be saying too much for certainly you have been one
of the most fortunate young women in the world as it is </s>
<s>   but i
confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon
brother </s>
<s>   his property here his place his house every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition </s>
<s> and his woods </s>
<s> i have not
seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there is now standing in
delaford hanger </s>
<s> and though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly
the person to attract himyet i think it would altogether be advisable
for you to have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel
brandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what may
happenfor when people are much thrown together and see little of
anybody elseand it will always be in your power to set her off to
advantage and so forth </s>
<s> in short you may as well give her a
chanceyou understand me </s>
<s> 

but though <abvr> ferrars did come to see them and always treated them
with the makebelieve of decent affection they were never insulted by
her real favour and preference </s>
<s>   that was due to the folly of robert
and the cunning of his wife </s>
<s>  and it was earned by them before many
months had passed away </s>
<s>   the selfish sagacity of the latter which had
at first drawn robert into the scrape was the principal instrument of
his deliverance from it </s>
<s>  for her respectful humility assiduous
attentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening was
given for their exercise reconciled <abvr> ferrars to his choice and
reestablished him completely in her favour </s>
<s> 

the whole of lucys behaviour in the affair and the prosperity which
crowned it therefore may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest an unceasing attention to selfinterest however
its progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing every
advantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience </s>
<s>   when robert first sought her acquaintance and privately
visited her in bartletts buildings it was only with the view imputed
to him by his brother </s>
<s>   he merely meant to persuade her to give up the
engagement </s>
<s>  and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter </s>
<s>   in that point however and that only he erred </s>
<s> for
though lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her
in time another visit another conversation was always wanted to
produce this conviction </s>
<s>   some doubts always lingered in her mind when
they parted which could only be removed by another half hours
discourse with himself </s>
<s>   his attendance was by this means secured and
the rest followed in course </s>
<s>   instead of talking of edward they came
gradually to talk only of roberta subject on which he had always
more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an
interest even equal to his own </s>
<s>  and in short it became speedily
evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother </s>
<s>   he was
proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward and very proud of
marrying privately without his mothers consent </s>
<s>   what immediately
followed is known </s>
<s>   they passed some months in great happiness at
dawlish </s>
<s>  for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cutand
he drew several plans for magnificent cottages </s>
<s> and from thence
returning to town procured the forgiveness of <abvr> ferrars by the
simple expedient of asking it which at lucys instigation was
adopted </s>
<s>   the forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonable
comprehended only robert </s>
<s>  and lucy who had owed his mother no duty and
therefore could have transgressed none still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned </s>
<s>   but perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages in selfcondemnation for roberts offence and gratitude for
the unkindness she was treated with procured her in time the haughty
notice which overcame her by its graciousness and led soon afterwards
by rapid degrees to the highest state of affection and influence </s>
<s> 
lucy became as necessary to <abvr> ferrars as either robert or fanny </s>
<s> 
and while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
to marry her and elinor though superior to her in fortune and birth
was spoken of as an intruder she was in every thing considered and
always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child </s>
<s>   they settled in
town received very liberal assistance from <abvr> ferrars were on the
best terms imaginable with the dashwoods </s>
<s>  and setting aside the
jealousies and illwill continually subsisting between fanny and lucy
in which their husbands of course took a part as well as the frequent
domestic disagreements between robert and lucy themselves nothing
could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together </s>
<s> 

what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son might have
puzzled many people to find out </s>
<s>  and what robert had done to succeed to
it might have puzzled them still more </s>
<s>   it was an arrangement
however justified in its effects if not in its cause </s>
<s>  for nothing
ever appeared in roberts style of living or of talking to give a
suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income as either leaving
his brother too little or bringing himself too much </s>
<s> and if edward
might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every
particular from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home and
from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits he might be supposed no
less contented with his lot no less free from every wish of an
exchange </s>
<s> 

elinors marriage divided her as little from her family as could well
be contrived without rendering the cottage at barton entirely useless
for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her visits at delaford </s>
<s>  for her wish of bringing
marianne and colonel brandon together was hardly less earnest though
rather more liberal than what john had expressed </s>
<s>   it was now her
darling object </s>
<s>   precious as was the company of her daughter to her
she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her
valued friend </s>
<s>  and to see marianne settled at the mansionhouse was
equally the wish of edward and elinor </s>
<s>   they each felt his sorrows and
their own obligations and marianne by general consent was to be the
reward of all </s>
<s> 

with such a confederacy against herwith a knowledge so intimate of
his goodnesswith a conviction of his fond attachment to herself
which at last though long after it was observable to everybody
elseburst on herwhat could she do </s>
<s> 

marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate </s>
<s>   she was born to
discover the falsehood of her own opinions and to counteract by her
conduct her most favourite maxims </s>
<s>   she was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship voluntarily to give
her hand to another </s>
<s> and that other a man who had suffered no less
than herself under the event of a former attachment whom two years
before she had considered too old to be marriedand who still sought
the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat </s>
<s> 

but so it was </s>
<s>   instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion as once she had fondly flattered herself with expectinginstead
of remaining even for ever with her mother and finding her only
pleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her more calm and
sober judgment she had determined onshe found herself at nineteen
submitting to new attachments entering on new duties placed in a new
home a wife the mistress of a family and the patroness of a village </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon was now as happy as all those who best loved him
believed he deserved to be </s>
<s> in marianne he was consoled for every past
affliction </s>
<s> her regard and her society restored his mind to animation
and his spirits to cheerfulness </s>
<s>  and that marianne found her own
happiness in forming his was equally the persuasion and delight of
each observing friend </s>
<s>   marianne could never love by halves </s>
<s>  and her
whole heart became in time as much devoted to her husband as it had
once been to willoughby </s>
<s> 

willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang </s>
<s>  and his
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
mrs </s>
<s>  smith who by stating his marriage with a woman of character as
the source of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he
behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have been happy
and rich </s>
<s>   that his repentance of misconduct which thus brought its
own punishment was sincere need not be doubted </s>
<s> nor that he long
thought of colonel brandon with envy and of marianne with regret </s>
<s>   but
that he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society or
contracted an habitual gloom of temper or died of a broken heart must
not be depended onfor he did neither </s>
<s>   he lived to exert and
frequently to enjoy himself </s>
<s>   his wife was not always out of humour
nor his home always uncomfortable </s>
<s>  and in his breed of horses and dogs
and in sporting of every kind he found no inconsiderable degree of
domestic felicity </s>
<s> 

for marianne howeverin spite of his incivility in surviving her
losshe always retained that decided regard which interested him in
every thing that befell her and made her his secret standard of
perfection in woman </s>
<s> and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him
in afterdays as bearing no comparison with <abvr> brandon </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage without
attempting a removal to delaford </s>
<s>  and fortunately for sir john and <abvr>
jennings when marianne was taken from them margaret had reached an
age highly suitable for dancing and not very ineligible for being
supposed to have a lover </s>
<s> 

between barton and delaford there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate </s>
<s> and among the
merits and the happiness of elinor and marianne let it not be ranked
as the least considerable that though sisters and living almost
within sight of each other they could live without disagreement
between themselves or producing coolness between their husbands </s>
<s>
