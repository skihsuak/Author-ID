<s> treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the
circumstances attending his birth

among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will
assign no fictitious name there is one anciently common to most towns
great or small </s>
<s>  to wit a workhouse </s>
<s>  and in this workhouse was born </s>
<s>  on
a day and date which i need not trouble myself to repeat inasmuch as
it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of
the business at all events </s>
<s>  the item of mortality whose name is
prefixed to the head of this </s>
<s> </s>
<s> 

for a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all </s>
<s>  in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared </s>
<s>  or if they had that being comprised within a couple of
pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the
literature of any age or country </s>
<s> 

although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befall a human being i do mean to say that in this
particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could
by possibility have occurred </s>
<s>   the fact is that there was considerable
difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of
respirationa troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence </s>
<s>  and for some time he lay gasping on a
little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and
the next </s>
<s>  the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter </s>
<s>   now
if during this brief period oliver had been surrounded by careful
grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of
profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been
killed in no time </s>
<s>   there being nobody by however but a pauper old
woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer </s>
<s> 
and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract </s>
<s>  oliver and
nature fought out the point between them </s>
<s>   the result was that after
a few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise
to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed  upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter </s>
<s> 

as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his
lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
bedstead rustled </s>
<s>  the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly
from the pillow </s>
<s>  and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words
let me see the child and die </s>
<s> 

the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire </s>
<s> 
giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately </s>
<s>   as the
young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with
more kindness than might have been expected of him </s>
<s> 

oh you must not talk about dying yet </s>
<s> 

lor bless her dear heart no </s>
<s>  interposed the nurse hastily
depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which
she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction </s>
<s> 

lor bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as i have sir
and had thirteen children of her own and all on em dead except two
and them in the wurkus with me shell know better than to take on in
that way bless her dear heart </s>
<s>   think what it is to be a mother
theres a dear young lamb do </s>
<s> 

apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed
in producing its due effect </s>
<s>   the patient shook her head and stretched
out her hand towards the child </s>
<s> 

the surgeon deposited it in her arms </s>
<s>   she imprinted her cold white
lips passionately on its forehead </s>
<s>  passed her hands over her face </s>
<s> 
gazed wildly round </s>
<s>  shuddered </s>

breast hands and temples </s>

talked of hope and comfort </s>

its all over <abvr> thingummy </s>
<s>  said the surgeon at last </s>
<s> 

ah poor dear so it is </s>
<s>  said the nurse picking up the cork of the
green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to
take up the child </s>
<s>   poor dear </s>
<s> 

you neednt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said
the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation </s>
<s>  its very
likely it will be troublesome </s>
<s>  give it a little gruel if it is </s>
<s>   he
put on his hat and pausing by the bedside on his way to the door
added she was a goodlooking girl too </s>

she was brought here last night replied the old woman by the
overseers order </s>
<s>   she was found lying in the street </s>
<s>   she had walked
some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces </s>

from or where she was going to nobody knows </s>

story he said shaking his head </s>

goodnight </s>
<s> 

the medical gentleman walked away to dinner </s>

more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low chair
before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant </s>

chapter ii

treats of oliver twists growth education and board

for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic
course of treachery and deception </s>
<s>   he was brought up by hand </s>
<s>   the
hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities </s>
<s>   the parish
authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether
there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a
situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of
which he stood in need </s>
<s>   the workhouse authorities replied with
humility that there was not </s>
<s>  upon this the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed
or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse
some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
against the poorlaws rolled about the floor all day without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and
for the consideration of sevenpencehalfpenny per small head per week </s>
<s> 
sevenpencehalfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child </s>
<s> 
a great deal may be got for sevenpencehalfpenny quite enough to
overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable </s>
<s>  the elderly female was
a woman of wisdom and experience </s>
<s>  she knew what was good for children </s>
<s> 
and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself </s>
<s> 
so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own
use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
allowance than was originally provided for them </s>
<s>   thereby finding in
the lowest depth a deeper still </s>
<s>  and proving herself a very great
experimental philosopher </s>
<s> 

everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who
demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw
a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
rampacious animal on nothing at all if he had not died
fourandtwenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable
bait of air </s>
<s>   unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the
female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a
similar result usually attended the operation of her system </s>
<s>  for at
the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen
in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want
and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got halfsmothered by
accident </s>
<s>  in any one of which cases the miserable little being was
usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers
it had never known in this </s>
<s> 

occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
washingthough the latter accident was very scarce anything
approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury
would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the
parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a
remonstrance </s>
<s>   but these impertinences were speedily checked by the
evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle </s>
<s>  the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was
very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
the parish wanted </s>
<s>  which was very selfdevotional </s>
<s>   besides the board
made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the
day before to say they were going </s>
<s>   the children were neat and clean
to behold when they went </s>
<s>  and what more would the people have </s>
<s> 

it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any
very extraordinary or luxuriant crop </s>
<s>   oliver twists ninth birthday
found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and
decidedly small in circumference </s>
<s>   but nature or inheritance had
implanted a good sturdy spirit in olivers breast </s>
<s>   it had had plenty
of room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment </s>
<s>  and
perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth
birthday at all </s>
<s>   be this as it may however it was his ninth
birthday </s>
<s>  and he was keeping it in the coalcellar with a select party
of two other young gentleman who after participating with him in a
sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be
hungry when <abvr> mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly
startled by the apparition of <abvr> bumble the beadle striving to undo
the wicket of the gardengate </s>

now <abvr> bumble was a fat man and a choleric </s>

the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick
which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles </s>

mrs </s>

reflection how comes he to have any name at all then </s>

myself to take him there </s>
<s>   so let me see him at once </s>
<s> 

ill fetch him directly said <abvr> mann leaving the room for that
purpose </s>
<s>   oliver having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed
off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent protectress </s>
<s> 

make a bow to the gentleman oliver said <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair
and the cocked hat on the table </s>
<s> 

will you go along with me oliver </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble in a majestic
voice </s>
<s> 

oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of <abvr> mann who had
got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a
furious countenance </s>
<s>   he took the hint at once for the fist had been
too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his
recollection </s>
<s> 

will she go with me </s>
<s>  inquired poor oliver </s>
<s> 

no she cant replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   but shell come and see you
sometimes </s>
<s> 

this was no very great consolation to the child </s>
<s>   young as he was
however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at
going away </s>
<s>   it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears
into his eyes </s>
<s>   hunger and recent illusage are great assistants if you
want to cry </s>
<s>  and oliver cried very naturally indeed </s>
<s>   <abvr> mann gave
him a thousand embraces and what oliver wanted a great deal more a
piece of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got
to the workhouse </s>
<s>  with the slice of bread in his hand and the little
browncloth parish cap on his head oliver was then led away by <abvr>
bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never
lighted the gloom of his infant years </s>
<s>   and yet he burst into an agony
of childish grief as the cottagegate closed after him </s>
<s>   wretched as
were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were
the only friends he had ever known </s>
<s>  and a sense of his loneliness in
the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble walked on with long strides </s>
<s>  little oliver firmly grasping
his goldlaced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every
quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there </s>
<s>  to these
interrogations <abvr> bumble returned very brief and snappish replies </s>
<s>  for
the temporary blandness which ginandwater awakens in some bosoms had
by this time evaporated </s>
<s>  and he was once again a beadle </s>
<s> 

oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread when <abvr> bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old
woman returned </s>
<s>  and telling him it was a board night informed him
that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith </s>
<s> 

not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was
oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite
certain whether he ought to laugh or cry </s>
<s>   he had no time to think
about the matter however </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bumble gave him a tap on the head
with his cane to wake him up </s>
<s>  and another on the back to make him
lively </s>
<s>  and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large
whitewashed room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round
a table </s>
<s>   at the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher
than the rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red
face </s>
<s> 

bow to the board said bumble </s>
<s>   oliver brushed away two or three
tears that were lingering in his eyes </s>
<s>  and seeing no board but the
table fortunately bowed to that </s>
<s> 

whats your name boy </s>
<s>  said the gentleman in the high chair </s>
<s> 

oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him
tremble </s>
<s>  and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him
cry </s>
<s>   these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating
voice </s>
<s>  whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool </s>
<s> 
which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite
at his ease </s>
<s> 

boy said the gentleman in the high chair listen to me </s>
<s>  you know
youre an orphan i suppose </s>
<s> 

whats that sir </s>
<s>  inquired poor oliver </s>
<s> 

the boy is a fooli thought he was said the gentleman in the
white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said the gentleman who had spoken first </s>
<s>   you know youve got
no father or mother and that you were brought up by the parish dont
you </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver weeping bitterly </s>
<s> 

what are you crying for </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat </s>
<s>   and to be sure it was very extraordinary </s>
<s>   what could the
boy be crying for </s>
<s> 

i hope you say your prayers every night said another gentleman in a
gruff voice </s>
<s>  and pray for the people who feed you and take care of
youlike a christian </s>
<s> 

yes sir stammered the boy </s>
<s>   the gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right </s>
<s>   it would have been very like a christian and a
marvellously good christian too if oliver had prayed for the people
who fed and took care of him </s>
<s>  but he hadnt because nobody had
taught him </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>   you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade
said the redfaced gentleman in the high chair </s>
<s> 

so youll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six oclock added
the surly one in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process
of picking oakum oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and
was then hurried away to a large ward </s>
<s>  where on a rough hard bed he
sobbed himself to sleep </s>
<s>   what a novel illustration of the tender laws
of england </s>
<s>   they let the paupers go to sleep </s>
<s> 

poor oliver </s>
<s>   he little thought as he lay sleeping in happy
unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day
arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence
over all his future fortunes </s>
<s>   but they had </s>
<s>   and this was it </s>
<s> 

the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men </s>
<s>  and
when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out
at once what ordinary folks would never have discoveredthe poor
people liked it </s>
<s>   it was a regular place of public entertainment for
the poorer classes </s>
<s>  a tavern where there was nothing to pay </s>
<s>  a public
breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year round </s>
<s>  a brick and
mortar elysium where it was all play and no work </s>
<s>   oho </s>
<s>  said the
board looking very knowing </s>
<s>  we are the fellows to set this to rights </s>
<s> 
well stop it all in no time </s>
<s>   so they established the rule that
all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel
nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house
or by a quick one out of it </s>
<s>   with this view they contracted with the
waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water </s>
<s>  and with a
cornfactor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal </s>
<s>  and
issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and
half a roll of sundays </s>
<s>   they made a great many other wise and humane
regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary
to repeat </s>
<s>  kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in
consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons </s>
<s>  and
instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had
theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a
bachelor </s>
<s>   there is no saying how many applicants for relief under
these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society
if it had not been coupled with the workhouse </s>
<s>  but the board were
longheaded men and had provided for this difficulty </s>
<s>   the relief was
inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel </s>
<s>  and that frightened
people </s>
<s> 

for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was
in full operation </s>
<s>   it was rather expensive at first in consequence of
the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in
the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their
wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel </s>
<s>   but the number of
workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers </s>
<s>  and the board were
in ecstasies </s>
<s> 

the room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a
copper at one end </s>
<s>  out of which the master dressed in an apron for the
purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at
mealtimes </s>
<s>   of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and
no moreexcept on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two
ounces and a quarter of bread besides </s>
<s> 

the bowls never wanted washing </s>
<s>   the boys polished them with their
spoons till they shone again </s>
<s>  and when they had performed this
operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large
as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager
eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
composed </s>
<s>  employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers
most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
gruel that might have been cast thereon </s>
<s>   boys have generally excellent
appetites </s>
<s>  oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months </s>
<s>  at last they got so voracious and
wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt
been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small
cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another
basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to
eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of
tender age </s>
<s>   he had a wild hungry eye </s>
<s>  and they implicitly believed
him </s>
<s>  a council was held </s>
<s>  lots were cast who should walk up to the
master after supper that evening and ask for more </s>
<s>  and it fell to
oliver twist </s>
<s> 

the evening arrived </s>
<s>  the boys took their places </s>
<s>   the master in his
cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper </s>
<s>  his pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him </s>
<s>  the gruel was served out </s>
<s>  and a long
grace was said over the short commons </s>
<s>   the gruel disappeared </s>
<s>  the boys
whispered each other and winked at oliver </s>
<s>  while his next neighbors
nudged him </s>
<s>   child as he was he was desperate with hunger and
reckless with misery </s>
<s>   he rose from the table </s>
<s>  and advancing to the
master basin and spoon in hand said </s>
<s>  somewhat alarmed at his own
temerity </s>
<s> 

please sir i want some more </s>
<s> 

the master was a fat healthy man </s>
<s>  but he turned very pale </s>
<s>  he gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then
clung for support to the copper </s>
<s>   the assistants were paralysed with
wonder </s>
<s>  the boys with fear </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said the master at length in a faint voice </s>
<s> 

please sir replied oliver i want some more </s>

the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle </s>

in his arm </s>

the board were sitting in solemn conclave when <abvr> bumble rushed into
the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high
chair said

nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion </s>

chapter iii

relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not
have been a sinecure

for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
the board </s>
<s>   it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose
that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have
established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for
ever by tying one end of his pockethandkerchief to a hook in the
wall and attaching himself to the other </s>
<s>   to the performance of this
feat however there was one obstacle </s>
<s>  namely that
pockethandkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for
all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board in council assembled </s>
<s>  solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals </s>
<s>   there was a still greater
obstacle in olivers youth and childishness </s>
<s>   he only cried bitterly
all day </s>
<s>  and when the long dismal night came on spread his little
hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the
corner tried to sleep </s>
<s>  ever and anon waking with a start and tremble
and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even
its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness
which surrounded him </s>
<s> 

let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the
period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious
consolation </s>
<s>   as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was
allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a
stone yard in the presence of <abvr> bumble who prevented his catching
cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated
applications of the cane </s>
<s>   as for society he was carried every other
day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a
public warning and example </s>
<s>   and so far from being denied the
advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same
apartment every evening at prayertime and there permitted to listen
to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys
containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the
board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented
and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver
twist </s>
<s>  whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the
exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an
article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself </s>
<s> 

it chanced one morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious
and comfortable state that <abvr> gamfield chimneysweep went his way
down the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means
of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become
rather pressing </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfields most sanguine estimate of his finances
could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount </s>
<s> 
and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately
cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his
eyes encountered the bill on the gate </s>
<s> 

woo </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gamfield to the donkey </s>
<s> 

the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction </s>
<s>  wondering probably
whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbagestalk or two when
he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
laden </s>
<s>  so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but
more particularly on his eyes </s>
<s>  and running after him bestowed a blow
on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a
donkeys </s>
<s>   then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp
wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master </s>
<s>  and
by these means turned him round </s>
<s>   he then gave him another blow on the
head just to stun him till he came back again </s>
<s>   having completed these
arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill </s>
<s> 

the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound
sentiments in the boardroom </s>
<s>   having witnessed the little dispute
between <abvr> gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that
person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that <abvr> gamfield
was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfield
smiled too as he perused the document </s>
<s>  for five pounds was just the
sum he had been wishing for </s>
<s>  and as to the boy with which it was
encumbered <abvr> gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing
for register stoves </s>
<s>   so he spelt the bill through again from
beginning to end </s>
<s>  and then touching his fur cap in token of humility
accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said <abvr>
gamfield </s>
<s> 

ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a
condescending smile </s>
<s>   what of him </s>
<s> 

if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a
good spectable chimbleysweepin bisness said <abvr> gamfield i wants
a prentis and i am ready to take him </s>
<s> 

walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s>   <abvr> gamfield
having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head
and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his
absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room
where oliver had first seen him </s>
<s> 

its a nasty trade said <abvr> limbkins when gamfield had again stated
his wish </s>
<s> 

young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another
gentleman </s>
<s> 

thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley
to make em come down again said gamfield </s>
<s>  thats all smoke and no
blaze </s>
<s>  vereas smoke aint o no use at all in making a boy come down
for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes </s>
<s>   boys is wery
obstinit and wery lazy genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot
blaze to make em come down vith a run </s>
<s>   its humane too genlmen
acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet
makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves </s>
<s> 

the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
explanation </s>
<s>  but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from <abvr>
limbkins </s>
<s>   the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a
few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of
expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report
published were alone audible </s>
<s>   these only chanced to be heard
indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great
emphasis </s>
<s> 

at length the whispering ceased </s>
<s>  and the members of the board having
resumed their seats and their solemnity <abvr> limbkins said </s>
<s> 

we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it </s>
<s> 

not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

decidedly not added the other members </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of
having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him
that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into
their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their
proceedings </s>
<s>  it was very unlike their general mode of doing business
if they had </s>
<s>  but still as he had no particular wish to revive the
rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the
table </s>
<s> 

so you wont let me have him genlmen </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gamfield pausing
near the door </s>
<s> 

no replied <abvr> limbkins </s>
<s>  at least as its a nasty business we
think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he
returned to the table and said

whatll you give genlmen </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   dont be too hard on a poor man </s>
<s> 
whatll you give </s>
<s> 

i should say three pound ten was plenty said <abvr> limbkins </s>

ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>

<s>  say four pound genlmen </s>
<s>   say four pound and
youve got rid of him for good and all </s>
<s>   there </s>

three pound ten repeated <abvr> limbkins firmly </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>   ill split the difference genlmen urged gamfield </s>
<s>  three
pound fifteen </s>
<s> 

not a farthing more was the firm reply of <abvr> limbkins </s>
<s> 

youre desperate hard upon me genlmen said gamfield wavering </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>   pooh </s>
<s>   nonsense </s>
<s>  said the gentleman in the white waistcoat </s>
<s> 
hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium </s>
<s>  take him you silly
fellow </s>
<s>   hes just the boy for you </s>
<s>   he wants the stick now and then </s>
<s> 
itll do him good </s>
<s>  and his board neednt come very expensive for he
hasnt been overfed since he was born </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and
observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself </s>
<s> 
the bargain was made </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was at once instructed that oliver
twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for
signature and approval that very afternoon </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive
astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself
into a clean shirt </s>
<s>   he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
performance when <abvr> bumble brought him with his own hands a basin
of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of
bread </s>
<s>  at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously </s>
<s> 
thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill
him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten
him up in that way </s>
<s> 

dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful
said <abvr> bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity </s>
<s>  youre a going to
be made a prentice of oliver </s>
<s> 

a prentice sir </s>
<s>  said the child trembling </s>
<s> 

yes oliver said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   the kind and blessed gentleman which
is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own </s>
<s>  are
a going to prentice you </s>
<s>  and to set you up in life and make a man of
you </s>
<s>  although the expense to the parish is three pound ten </s>
<s> three
pound ten oliver </s>
<s> seventy shillinsone hundred and forty
sixpences </s>
<s> and all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in
an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he
sobbed bitterly </s>
<s> 

come said <abvr> bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying
to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced </s>
<s> 
come oliver </s>
<s>   wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont
cry into your gruel </s>
<s>  thats a very foolish action oliver </s>
<s>   it
certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already </s>
<s> 

on their way to the magistrate <abvr> bumble instructed oliver that all
he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the
gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like
it very much indeed </s>
<s>  both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey </s>
<s> 
the rather as <abvr> bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in
either particular there was no telling what would be done to him </s>
<s>  when
they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself
and admonished by <abvr> bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch
him </s>
<s> 

there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour </s>
<s>   at
the expiration of which time <abvr> bumble thrust in his head unadorned
with the cocked hat and said aloud </s>
<s> 

now oliver my dear come to the gentleman </s>
<s>   as <abvr> bumble said
this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice
mind what i told you you young rascal </s>
<s> 

oliver stared innocently in <abvr> bumbles face at this somewhat
contradictory style of address </s>
<s>  but that gentleman prevented his
offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining
room </s>
<s>  the door of which was open </s>
<s>  it was a large room with a great
window </s>
<s>   behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads </s>
<s>  one
of whom was reading the newspaper </s>
<s>  while the other was perusing with
the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of
parchment which lay before him </s>
<s>   <abvr> limbkins was standing in front of
the desk on one side </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gamfield with a partially washed face
on the other </s>
<s>  while two or three blufflooking men in topboots were
lounging about </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the
little bit of parchment </s>
<s>  and there was a short pause after oliver had
been stationed by <abvr> bumble in front of the desk </s>
<s> 

this is the boy your worship said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve </s>
<s>  whereupon
the lastmentioned old gentleman woke up </s>
<s> 

oh is this the boy </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

this is him sir replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   bow to the magistrate my
dear </s>
<s> 

oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance </s>
<s>   he had been
wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all
boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards
from thenceforth on that account </s>
<s> 

well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of
chimneysweeping </s>
<s> 

he doats on it your worship replied bumble </s>
<s>  giving oliver a sly
pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt </s>
<s> 

and he will be a sweep will he </s>
<s>  inquired the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

if we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed run away
simultaneous your worship replied bumble </s>
<s> 

and this man thats to be his masteryou siryoull treat him well
and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you </s>
<s>  said the old
gentleman </s>
<s> 

when i says i will i means i will replied <abvr> gamfield doggedly </s>
<s> 

youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest
openhearted man said the old gentleman </s>
<s>  turning his spectacles in
the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villainous
countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty </s>
<s>   but the
magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably
be expected to discern what other people did </s>
<s> 

i hope i am sir said <abvr> gamfield with an ugly leer </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  fixing
his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the
inkstand </s>
<s> 

it was the critical moment of olivers fate </s>
<s>   if the inkstand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen
into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been
straightway hurried off </s>
<s>   but as it chanced to be immediately under
his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over
his desk for it without finding it </s>
<s>  and happening in the course of his
search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and
terrified face of oliver twist </s>
<s>  who despite all the admonitory looks
and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his
future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too
palpable to be mistaken even by a halfblind magistrate </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to
mr </s>
<s>  limbkins </s>
<s>  who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and
unconcerned aspect </s>
<s> 

my boy </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed </s>
<s>  what is
the matter </s>
<s> 

stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate </s>
<s> 
laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of
interest </s>
<s>   now boy tell us whats the matter </s>
<s>  dont be afraid </s>
<s> 

oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that
they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve
himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with
that dreadful man </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble raising his hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  of all the artful and designing orphans
that ever i see oliver you are one of the most barefacedest </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when <abvr>
bumble had given vent to this compound adjective </s>
<s> 

i beg your worships pardon said <abvr> bumble incredulous of having
heard aright </s>
<s>   did your worship speak to me </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   hold your tongue </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble was stupefied with astonishment </s>
<s>   a beadle ordered to hold
his tongue </s>
<s>   a moral revolution </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked at his
companion he nodded significantly </s>
<s> 

we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 
tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke </s>
<s> 

i hope stammered <abvr> limbkins </s>
<s>   i hope the magistrates will not
form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child </s>
<s> 

the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
matter said the second old gentleman sharply </s>
<s>   take the boy back to
the workhouse and treat him kindly </s>
<s>   he seems to want it </s>
<s> 

that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he
would be drawn and quartered into the bargain </s>
<s>  <abvr> bumble shook his
head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good </s>
<s> 
whereunto <abvr> gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him </s>
<s> 
which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem
to be a wish of a totally opposite description </s>
<s> 

the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was
again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would
take possession of him </s>
<s> 



chapter iv

oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public
life

in great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained
either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the
young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to
sea </s>
<s>   the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took
counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in
some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port </s>
<s>   this
suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
with him </s>
<s>  the probability being that the skipper would flog him to
death in a playful mood some day after dinner or would knock his
brains out with an iron bar </s>
<s>  both pastimes being as is pretty
generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
of that class </s>
<s>   the more the case presented itself to the board in
this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step
appeared </s>
<s>  so they came to the conclusion that the only way of
providing for oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries
with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a
cabinboy without any friends </s>
<s>  and was returning to the workhouse to
communicate the result of his mission </s>
<s>  when he encountered at the gate
no less a person than <abvr> sowerberry the parochial undertaker </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sowerberry was a tall gaunt largejointed man attired in a suit
of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour
and shoes to answer </s>
<s>   his features were not naturally intended to wear
a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional
jocosity </s>
<s>   his step was elastic and his face betokened inward
pleasantry as he advanced to <abvr> bumble and shook him cordially by
the hand </s>
<s> 

i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night <abvr>
bumble said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

youll make your fortune <abvr> sowerberry said the beadle as he
thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuffbox of the
undertaker </s>
<s>  which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin </s>
<s>   i
say youll make your fortune <abvr> sowerberry repeated <abvr> bumble
tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his
cane </s>
<s> 

think so </s>
<s>  said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half
disputed the probability of the event </s>
<s>   the prices allowed by the
board are very small <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

so are the coffins replied the beadle </s>
<s>  with precisely as near an
approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sowerberry was much tickled at this </s>
<s>  as of course he ought to be </s>
<s> 
and laughed a long time without cessation </s>
<s>   well well <abvr> bumble
he said at length theres no denying that since the new system of
feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more
shallow than they used to be </s>
<s>  but we must have some profit <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 
wellseasoned timber is an expensive article sir </s>
<s>  and all the iron
handles come by canal from birmingham </s>
<s> 

well well said <abvr> bumble every trade has its drawbacks </s>
<s>  a fair
profit is of course allowable </s>
<s> 

of course of course replied the undertaker </s>
<s>  and if i dont get a
profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the
longrun you seehe </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s> 

just so said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of
observations which the beadle had interrupted </s>
<s>  though i must say <abvr>
bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage </s>
<s> 
which is that all the stout people go off the quickest </s>
<s>   the people
who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the
first to sink when they come into the house </s>
<s>  and let me tell you <abvr>
bumble that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great
hole in ones profits </s>
<s>  especially when one has a family to provide for
sir </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an
illused man </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a
reflection on the honour of the parish </s>
<s>  the latter gentleman thought it
advisable to change the subject </s>
<s>   oliver twist being uppermost in his
mind he made him his theme </s>
<s> 

by the bye said <abvr> bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy
do you </s>
<s>   a porochial prentis who is at present a deadweight </s>
<s>  a
millstone as i may say round the porochial throat </s>
<s>   liberal terms
mr </s>
<s>  sowerberry liberal terms </s>
<s>   as <abvr> bumble spoke he raised his
cane to the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words
five pounds </s>
<s>   which were printed thereon in roman capitals of
gigantic size </s>
<s> 

gadso </s>
<s>  said the undertaker </s>
<s>  taking <abvr> bumble by the giltedged
lappel of his official coat </s>
<s>  thats just the very thing i wanted to
speak to you about </s>
<s>   you knowdear me what a very elegant button this
is <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   i never noticed it before </s>
<s> 

yes i think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly
downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat </s>
<s>  the
die is the same as the porochial sealthe good samaritan healing the
sick and bruised man </s>
<s>  the board presented it to me on newyears
morning <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   i put it on i remember for the first time
to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway
at midnight </s>
<s> 

i recollect said the undertaker </s>
<s>  the jury brought it in died from
exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life
didnt they </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded </s>
<s> 

and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by
adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had

tush </s>
<s>   foolery </s>
<s>  interposed the beadle </s>
<s>   if the board attended to all
the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do </s>
<s> 

very true said the undertaker </s>
<s>  they would indeed </s>
<s> 

juries said <abvr> bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont
when working into a passion </s>
<s>  juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling
wretches </s>
<s> 

so they are said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than
that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously </s>
<s> 

no more they have acquiesced the undertaker </s>
<s> 

i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face </s>
<s> 

so do i rejoined the undertaker </s>
<s> 

and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for
a week or two said the beadle </s>
<s>  the rules and regulations of the
board would soon bring their spirit down for em </s>
<s> 

let em alone for that replied the undertaker </s>
<s>   so saying he
smiled approvingly </s>
<s>  to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish
officer </s>
<s> 

mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat </s>
<s>  took a handkerchief from the
inside of the crown </s>
<s>  wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his
rage had engendered </s>
<s>  fixed the cocked hat on again </s>
<s>  and turning to the
undertaker said in a calmer voice </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  what about the boy </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  replied the undertaker </s>
<s>  why you know <abvr> bumble i pay a good
deal towards the poors rates </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>

<s> 

well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much
towards em ive a right to get as much out of em as i can <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s>  and soi think ill take the boy myself </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the
building </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes </s>
<s> 
and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening upon
likinga phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that

a term of years to do what he likes with </s>

when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening </s>

informed that he was to go that night as general houselad to a
coffinmakers </s>
<s>  and that if he complained of his situation or ever
came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be
drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so
little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened
young rascal and ordered <abvr> bumble to remove him forthwith </s>
<s> 

now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the
world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror
at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they
were rather out in this particular instance </s>
<s>   the simple fact was
that oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather
too much </s>
<s>  and was in a fair way of being reduced for life to a state
of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received </s>
<s> 
he heard the news of his destination in perfect silence </s>
<s>  and having
had his luggage put into his handwhich was not very difficult to
carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown
paper parcel about half a foot square by three inches deephe pulled
his cap over his eyes </s>
<s>  and once more attaching himself to <abvr> bumbles
coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering </s>
<s> 

for some time <abvr> bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark </s>
<s> 
for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should </s>
<s> 
and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by
the skirts of <abvr> bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to
great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush kneebreeches </s>
<s>   as
they drew near to their destination however <abvr> bumble thought it
expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for
inspection by his new master </s>
<s>  which he accordingly did with a fit and
becoming air of gracious patronage </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s>   said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice </s>
<s> 

pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir </s>
<s> 

although oliver did as he was desired at once </s>
<s>  and passed the back of
his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them
when he looked up at his conductor </s>
<s>   as <abvr> bumble gazed sternly upon
him it rolled down his cheek </s>
<s>  it was followed by another and another </s>
<s> 
the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one </s>
<s> 
withdrawing his other hand from <abvr> bumbles he covered his face with
both </s>
<s>  and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and
bony fingers </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> bumble stopping short and darting at his little
charge a look of intense malignity </s>
<s>   well </s>

<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble in amazement </s>
<s> 

so lonely sir </s>
<s>   so very lonely </s>
<s>  cried the child </s>
<s>   everybody hates
me </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  sir dont dont pray be cross to me </s>
<s>   the child beat his
hand upon his heart </s>
<s>  and looked in his companions face with tears of
real agony </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some
astonishment for a few seconds </s>
<s>  hemmed three or four times in a husky
manner </s>
<s>  and after muttering something about that troublesome cough
bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy </s>
<s>  then once more taking his
hand he walked on with him in silence </s>
<s> 

the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was
making some entries in his daybook by the light of a most appropriate
dismal candle when <abvr> bumble entered </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the undertaker </s>
<s>  looking up from the book and pausing in
the middle of a word </s>
<s>  is that you bumble </s>
<s> 

no one else <abvr> sowerberry replied the beadle </s>

the boy </s>

oh </s>

above his head to get a better view of oliver </s>
<s>  <abvr> sowerberry will
you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and
presented the form of a short then squeezedup woman with a vixenish
countenance </s>
<s> 

my dear said <abvr> sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from
the workhouse that i told you of </s>
<s>   oliver bowed again </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  said the undertakers wife hes very small </s>
<s> 

why he is rather small replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  looking at oliver as
if it were his fault that he was no bigger </s>
<s>  he is small </s>
<s>  theres no
denying it </s>
<s>   but hell grow <abvr> sowerberryhell grow </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   i dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals
and our drink </s>
<s>   i see no saving in parish children not i </s>
<s>  for they
always cost more to keep than theyre worth </s>
<s>  however men always think
they know best </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>   get downstairs little bag o bones </s>
<s>   with
this the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed oliver down
a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark </s>
<s>  forming the
anteroom to the coalcellar and denominated kitchen </s>
<s>  wherein sat a
slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very
much out of repair </s>
<s> 

here charlotte said <abvr> sowerberry who had followed oliver down
give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip </s>
<s>   he
hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em </s>
<s>   i dare
say the boy isnt too dainty to eat emare you boy </s>
<s> 

oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was
trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative </s>
<s>  and a
plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him </s>
<s> 

i wish some wellfed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall
within him </s>
<s>  whose blood is ice whose heart is iron </s>
<s>  could have seen
oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected </s>
<s> 
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver
tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine </s>
<s>   there is only
one thing i should like better </s>
<s>  and that would be to see the
philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish </s>
<s> 

well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his
supper </s>
<s>  which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful
auguries of his future appetite </s>
<s>  have you done </s>
<s> 

there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the
affirmative </s>
<s> 

then come with me said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  taking up a dim and dirty
lamp and leading the way upstairs </s>
<s>  your beds under the counter </s>
<s>   you
dont mind sleeping among the coffins i suppose </s>
<s>  but it doesnt much
matter whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else </s>

oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress </s>

chapter v

oliver mingles with new associates </s>
<s>   going to a funeral for the first
time he forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business

oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp
down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling
of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be
at no loss to understand </s>
<s>   an unfinished coffin on black tressels
which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and deathlike
that a cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the
direction of the dismal object </s>
<s>  from which he almost expected to see
some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror </s>
<s> 
against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm
boards cut in the same shape </s>
<s>  looking in the dim light like
highshouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets </s>
<s> 
coffinplates elmchips brightheaded nails and shreds of black
cloth lay scattered on the floor </s>
<s>  and the wall behind the counter was
ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff
neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by
four black steeds approaching in the distance </s>
<s>  the shop was close and
hot </s>
<s>   the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins </s>
<s>   the
recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust
looked like a grave </s>
<s> 

nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver </s>
<s>  he was
alone in a strange place </s>
<s>  and we all know how chilled and desolate the
best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation </s>
<s>  the boy had no
friends to care for or to care for him </s>
<s>   the regret of no recent
separation was fresh in his mind </s>
<s>  the absence of no loved and
wellremembered face sank heavily into his heart </s>
<s> 

but his heart was heavy notwithstanding </s>
<s>  and he wished as he crept
into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be
lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the
tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep
bell to soothe him in his sleep </s>
<s> 

oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of
the shopdoor </s>
<s>  which before he could huddle on his clothes was
repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twentyfive times </s>
<s> 
when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began </s>
<s> 

open the door will yer </s>
<s>  cried the voice which belonged to the legs
which had kicked at the door </s>
<s> 

i will directly sir replied oliver </s>
<s>  undoing the chain and turning
the key </s>
<s> 

i suppose yer the new boy aint yer </s>
<s>  said the voice through the
keyhole </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

how old are yer </s>
<s>  inquired the voice </s>
<s> 

ten sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

then ill whop yer when i get in said the voice </s>
<s>  you just see if i
dont thats all my workus brat </s>
<s>  and having made this obliging
promise the voice began to whistle </s>
<s> 

oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the
smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would
redeem his pledge most honourably </s>
<s>  he drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand and opened the door </s>
<s> 

for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street
and over the way </s>
<s>  impressed with the belief that the unknown who had
addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm
himself </s>
<s>  for nobody did he see but a big charityboy sitting on a post
in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter </s>
<s>  which he cut
into wedges the size of his mouth with a claspknife and then
consumed with great dexterity </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length </s>
<s>  seeing that no other
visitor made his appearance </s>
<s>  did you knock </s>
<s> 

i kicked replied the charityboy </s>
<s> 

did you want a coffin sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver innocently </s>
<s> 

at this the charityboy looked monstrous fierce </s>
<s>  and said that oliver
would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that
way </s>
<s> 

yer dont know who i am i suppose workus </s>
<s>  said the charityboy in
continuation </s>
<s>  descending from the top of the post meanwhile with
edifying gravity </s>
<s> 

no sir rejoined oliver </s>
<s> 

im mister noah claypole said the charityboy and youre under me </s>
<s> 
take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian </s>
<s>  with this <abvr>
claypole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a
dignified air which did him great credit </s>
<s>   it is difficult for a
largeheaded smalleyed youth of lumbering make and heavy
countenance to look dignified under any circumstances </s>
<s>  but it is more
especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red
nose and yellow smalls </s>
<s> 

oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in
his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a
small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the
day was graciously assisted by noah </s>
<s>  who having consoled him with the
assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sowerberry came down soon after </s>
<s>  shortly afterwards <abvr> sowerberry
appeared </s>
<s>   oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs
prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast </s>
<s> 

come near the fire noah said charlotte </s>
<s>   i saved a nice little bit
of bacon for you from masters breakfast </s>
<s>   oliver shut that door at
mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover
of the breadpan </s>
<s>   theres your tea </s>
<s>  take it away to that box and
drink it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop </s>

dye hear </s>
<s> 

dye hear workus </s>
<s>  said noah claypole </s>
<s> 

lor noah </s>
<s>  said charlotte what a rum creature you are </s>
<s>   why dont
you let the boy alone </s>
<s> 

let him alone </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   why everybody lets him alone enough for
the matter of that </s>
<s>   neither his father nor his mother will ever
interfere with him </s>
<s>   all his relations let him have his own way pretty
well </s>
<s>   eh charlotte </s>
<s>   he </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s>  he </s>
<s> 

oh you queer soul </s>
<s>  said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in
which she was joined by noah </s>
<s>  after which they both looked scornfully
at poor oliver twist as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest
corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially
reserved for him </s>
<s> 

noah was a charityboy but not a workhouse orphan </s>
<s>   no chancechild
was he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his
parents who lived hard by </s>
<s>  his mother being a washerwoman and his
father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal
pension of twopencehalfpenny and an unstateable fraction </s>
<s>   the
shopboys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding
noah in the public streets with the ignominious epithets of
leathers charity and the like </s>
<s>  and noah had bourne them without
reply </s>
<s>   but now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan at
whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on
him with interest </s>
<s>   this affords charming food for contemplation </s>
<s>   it
shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be </s>
<s>  and how
impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord
and the dirtiest charityboy </s>
<s> 

oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a
month </s>
<s>   <abvr> and <abvr> sowerberrythe shop being shut upwere taking
their supper in the little backparlour when <abvr> sowerberry after
several deferential glances at his wife said

my dear  he was going to say more </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sowerberry looking up
with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short </s>
<s> 

well said <abvr> sowerberry sharply </s>
<s> 

nothing my dear nothing said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

ugh you brute </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

not at all my dear said <abvr> sowerberry humbly </s>
<s>   i thought you
didnt want to hear my dear </s>
<s>   i was only going to say

oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   i am nobody </s>
<s>  dont consult me pray </s>
<s>   i dont want to
intrude upon your secrets </s>
<s>   as <abvr> sowerberry said this she gave an
hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences </s>
<s> 

but my dear said sowerberry i want to ask your advice </s>
<s> 

no no dont ask mine replied <abvr> sowerberry in an affecting
manner </s>
<s>  ask somebody elses </s>
<s>   here there was another hysterical
laugh which frightened <abvr> sowerberry very much </s>
<s>   this is a very
common and muchapproved matrimonial course of treatment which is
often very effective </s>
<s>  it at once reduced <abvr> sowerberry to begging as
a special favour to be allowed to say what <abvr> sowerberry was most
curious to hear </s>
<s>   after a short duration the permission was most
graciously conceded </s>
<s> 

its only about young twist my dear said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  a very
goodlooking boy that my dear </s>
<s> 

he need be for he eats enough observed the lady </s>
<s> 

theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed <abvr>
sowerberry which is very interesting </s>
<s>   he would make a delightful
mute my love </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable
wonderment </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for
any observation on the good ladys part proceeded </s>
<s> 

i dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but
only for childrens practice </s>
<s>   it would be very new to have a mute in
proportion my dear </s>
<s>   you may depend upon it it would have a superb
effect </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way
was much struck by the novelty of this idea </s>
<s>  but as it would have been
compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances
she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious
suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his
proposition </s>
<s>  it was speedily determined therefore that oliver should
be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade </s>
<s>  and with this
view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of
his services being required </s>
<s> 

the occasion was not long in coming </s>
<s>   half an hour after breakfast next
morning <abvr> bumble entered the shop </s>
<s>  and supporting his cane against
the counter drew forth his large leathern pocketbook </s>
<s>  from which he
selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sowerberry </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance </s>
<s> 
an order for a coffin eh </s>
<s> 

for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied <abvr>
bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocketbook </s>
<s>  which like
himself was very corpulent </s>
<s> 

bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s>   i never heard the name before </s>
<s> 

bumble shook his head as he replied obstinate people <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>  very obstinate </s>
<s>   proud too im afraid sir </s>
<s> 

proud eh </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry with a sneer </s>
<s>   come thats too
much </s>
<s> 

oh its sickening replied the beadle </s>
<s>   antimonial <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

so it is acquiesced the undertaker </s>
<s> 

we only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle </s>
<s> 
and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman
who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial
committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was
very bad </s>
<s>   he had gone out to dinner </s>
<s>  but his prentice which is a
very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blackingbottle offhand </s>
<s> 

ah theres promptness said the undertaker </s>
<s> 

promptness indeed </s>
<s>  replied the beadle </s>
<s>   but whats the consequence </s>
<s> 
whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir </s>
<s>   why the husband
sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and
so she shant take itsays she shant take it sir </s>
<s>   good strong
wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish
labourers and a coalheaver only a week beforesent em for nothing
with a blackinbottle inand he sends back word that she shant take
it sir </s>
<s> 

as the atrocity presented itself to <abvr> bumbles mind in full force he
struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with
indignation </s>
<s> 

well said the undertaker i neverdid

never did sir </s>
<s>  ejaculated the beadle </s>
<s>   no nor nobody never did </s>
<s> 
but now shes dead weve got to bury her </s>
<s>  and thats the direction </s>
<s> 
and the sooner its done the better </s>
<s> 

thus saying <abvr> bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a
fever of parochial excitement </s>
<s>  and flounced out of the shop </s>
<s> 

why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you </s>
<s> 
said <abvr> sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the
street </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of
sight during the interview </s>
<s>  and who was shaking from head to foot at
the mere recollection of the sound of <abvr> bumbles voice </s>
<s> 

he neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from <abvr> bumbles glance
however </s>
<s>  for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman
in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that
now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better
avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years
and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish
should be thus effectually and legally overcome </s>
<s> 

well said <abvr> sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is
done the better </s>
<s>   noah look after the shop </s>
<s>  oliver put on your cap
and come with me </s>
<s>   oliver obeyed and followed his master on his
professional mission </s>
<s> 

they walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely
inhabited part of the town </s>
<s>  and then striking down a narrow street
more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused
to look for the house which was the object of their search </s>
<s>   the houses
on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by
people of the poorest class </s>
<s>  as their neglected appearance would have
sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the
squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies
half doubled occasionally skulked along </s>
<s>   a great many of the
tenements had shopfronts </s>
<s>  but these were fast closed and mouldering
away </s>
<s>  only the upper rooms being inhabited </s>
<s>   some houses which had
become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into
the street by huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly
planted in the road </s>
<s>  but even these crazy dens seemed to have been
selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of
the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window were
wrenched from their positions to afford an aperture wide enough for
the passage of a human body </s>
<s>   the kennel was stagnant and filthy </s>
<s>  the
very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were
hideous with famine </s>
<s> 

there was neither knocker nor bellhandle at the open door where oliver
and his master stopped </s>
<s>  so groping his way cautiously through the dark
passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the
undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs </s>
<s>   stumbling
against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles </s>
<s> 

it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen </s>
<s>   the undertaker
at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the
apartment to which he had been directed </s>
<s>   he stepped in </s>
<s>  oliver
followed him </s>
<s> 

there was no fire in the room </s>
<s>  but a man was crouching mechanically
over the empty stove </s>
<s>   an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the
cold hearth and was sitting beside him </s>
<s>  there were some ragged
children in another corner </s>
<s>  and in a small recess opposite the door
there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket </s>
<s> 
oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place and crept
involuntarily closer to his master </s>
<s>  for though it was covered up the
boy felt that it was a corpse </s>
<s> 

the mans face was thin and very pale </s>
<s>  his hair and beard were grizzly </s>
<s> 
his eyes were bloodshot </s>
<s>   the old womans face was wrinkled </s>
<s>  her two
remaining teeth protruded over her under lip </s>
<s>  and her eyes were bright
and piercing </s>
<s>   oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man </s>
<s> 
they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside </s>
<s> 

nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the
undertaker approached the recess </s>
<s>  keep back </s>
<s>  damn you keep back if
youve a life to lose </s>
<s> 

nonsense my good man said the undertaker who was pretty well used
to misery in all its shapes </s>
<s>   nonsense </s>
<s> 

i tell you said the man </s>
<s>   clenching his hands and stamping
furiously on the floori tell you i wont have her put into the
ground </s>
<s>   she couldnt rest there </s>
<s>   the worms would worry hernot eat
hershe is so worn away </s>
<s> 

the undertaker offered no reply to this raving </s>
<s>  but producing a tape
from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s>  bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at
the feet of the dead woman </s>
<s>  kneel down kneel downkneel round her
every one of you and mark my words </s>
<s>   i say she was starved to death </s>
<s> 
i never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her </s>
<s>  and then
her bones were starting through the skin </s>
<s>   there was neither fire nor
candle </s>
<s>  she died in the darkin the dark </s>
<s>   she couldnt even see her
childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names </s>
<s>  i begged
for her in the streets </s>
<s>  and they sent me to prison </s>
<s>  when i came back
she was dying </s>
<s>  and all the blood in my heart has dried up for they
starved her to death </s>
<s>   i swear it before the god that saw it </s>
<s>  they
starved her </s>
<s>   he twined his hands in his hair </s>
<s>  and with a loud
scream rolled grovelling upon the floor </s>
<s>  his eyes fixed and the foam
covering his lips </s>
<s> 

the terrified children cried bitterly </s>
<s>  but the old woman who had
hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that
passed menaced them into silence </s>
<s>   having unloosened the cravat of the
man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the
undertaker </s>
<s> 

she was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the
direction of the corpse </s>
<s>  and speaking with an idiotic leer more
ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place </s>
<s>  lord lord </s>

<s>  she said eagerly </s>

undertakers coat as he once more moved towards the door </s>
<s> 

yes yes said the undertakerof course </s>
<s>   anything you like </s>
<s>  he
disengaged himself from the old womans grasp </s>
<s>  and drawing oliver
after him hurried away </s>
<s> 

the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
halfquartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by <abvr> bumble
himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode </s>
<s>  where
mr </s>
<s>  bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the
workhouse who were to act as bearers </s>
<s>   an old black cloak had been
thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man </s>
<s>  and the bare coffin
having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers
and carried into the street </s>
<s> 

now you must put your best leg foremost old lady </s>
<s>  whispered
sowerberry in the old womans ear </s>
<s>  we are rather late </s>
<s>  and it wont
do to keep the clergyman waiting </s>
<s>   move on my menas quick as you
like </s>
<s> 

thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden </s>
<s>  and the
two mourners kept as near them as they could </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble and
sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front </s>
<s>  and oliver whose legs
were not so long as his masters ran by the side </s>
<s> 

there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as <abvr> sowerberry had
anticipated however </s>
<s>  for when they reached the obscure corner of the
churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were
made the clergyman had not arrived </s>
<s>  and the clerk who was sitting by
the vestryroom fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it
might be an hour or so before he came </s>
<s>   so they put the bier on the
brink of the grave </s>
<s>  and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the
spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at
hideandseek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by
jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin </s>
<s>   <abvr> sowerberry and
bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him
and read the paper </s>
<s> 

at length after a lapse of something more than an hour <abvr> bumble
and sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave </s>
<s> 
immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared </s>
<s>  putting on his surplice
as he came along </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up
appearances </s>
<s>  and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his
surplice to the clerk and walked away again </s>
<s> 

now bill </s>
<s>  said sowerberry to the gravedigger </s>
<s>  fill up </s>
<s> 

it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the
uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface </s>
<s>   the
gravedigger shovelled in the earth </s>
<s>  stamped it loosely down with his
feet </s>
<s>  shouldered his spade </s>
<s>  and walked off followed by the boys who
murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon </s>
<s> 

come my good fellow </s>
<s>  said bumble tapping the man on the back </s>
<s>  they
want to shut up the yard </s>
<s> 

the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the
grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had
addressed him walked forward for a few paces </s>
<s>  and fell down in a
swoon </s>
<s>   the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss
of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any
attention </s>
<s>  so they threw a can of cold water over him </s>
<s>  and when he came
to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed
on their different ways </s>
<s> 

well oliver said sowerberry as they walked home how do you like
it </s>
<s> 

pretty well thank you sir replied oliver with considerable
hesitation </s>
<s>   not very much sir </s>
<s> 

ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sowerberry </s>
<s>  nothing
when you are used to it my boy </s>
<s> 

oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time
to get <abvr> sowerberry used to it </s>
<s>   but he thought it better not to ask
the question </s>
<s>  and walked back to the shop </s>
<s>  thinking over all he had
seen and heard </s>

chapter vi

oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and
rather astonishes him

the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed </s>
<s>   it was a nice
sickly season just at this time </s>
<s>   in commercial phrase coffins were
looking up </s>
<s>  and in the course of a few weeks oliver acquired a great
deal of experience </s>
<s>   the success of <abvr> sowerberrys ingenious
speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes </s>
<s>   the oldest
inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
prevalent or so fatal to infant existence </s>
<s>  and many were the mournful
processions which little oliver headed in a hatband reaching down to
his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town </s>
<s>   as oliver accompanied his master in most of his
adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a
finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the
beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strongminded
people bear their trials and losses </s>
<s> 

for instance </s>
<s>  when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich
old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews
and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous
illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most
public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need
bequite cheerful and contentedconversing together with as much
freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb
them </s>
<s>   husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness </s>
<s>  wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far
from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to
render it as becoming and attractive as possible </s>
<s>   it was observable
too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached
home and became quite composed before the teadrinking was over </s>
<s>   all
this was very pleasant and improving to see </s>
<s>  and oliver beheld it with
great admiration </s>
<s> 

that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
people i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence </s>
<s>  but i can most distinctly say that for
many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
illtreatment of noah claypole </s>
<s>  who used him far worse than before now
that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
black stick and hatband while he the old one remained stationary in
the muffincap and leathers </s>
<s>   charlotte treated him ill because noah
did </s>
<s>  and <abvr> sowerberry was his decided enemy because <abvr> sowerberry
was disposed to be his friend </s>
<s>  so between these three on one side and
a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in
the grain department of a brewery </s>
<s> 

and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history </s>
<s>  for i
have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance
but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future
prospects and proceedings </s>
<s> 

one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinnerhour to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a
half of the worst end of the neckwhen charlotte being called out of
the way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah claypole
being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a
worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist </s>
<s> 

intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the
tablecloth </s>
<s>  and pulled olivers hair </s>
<s>  and twitched his ears </s>
<s>  and
expressed his opinion that he was a sneak </s>
<s>  and furthermore announced
his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable
event should take place </s>
<s>  and entered upon various topics of petty
annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was </s>
<s> 
but making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still </s>
<s>  and
in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want
to be funny </s>
<s>   he got rather personal </s>
<s> 

workus said noah hows your mother </s>
<s> 

shes dead replied oliver </s>
<s>  dont you say anything about her to me </s>
<s> 

olivers colour rose as he said this </s>
<s>  he breathed quickly </s>
<s>  and there
was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which <abvr> claypole
thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying </s>
<s> 
under this impression he returned to the charge </s>
<s> 

what did she die of workus </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s> 

of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver </s>
<s> 
more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah </s>
<s>  i think i
know what it must be to die of that </s>
<s> 

tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear
rolled down olivers cheek </s>
<s>   whats set you a snivelling now </s>
<s> 

not you replied oliver sharply </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>  thats enough </s>
<s>  dont say
anything more to me about her </s>
<s>  youd better not </s>
<s> 

better not </s>
<s>  exclaimed noah </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>   better not </s>
<s>   workus dont be
impudent </s>
<s>   your mother too </s>
<s>   she was a nice un she was </s>
<s>   oh lor </s>
<s> 
and here noah nodded his head expressively </s>
<s>  and curled up as much of
his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the
occasion </s>
<s> 

yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence
and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity </s>
<s>  of all tones the most
annoying </s>
<s>  yer know workus it cant be helped now </s>
<s>  and of course yer
couldnt help it then </s>
<s>  and i am very sorry for it </s>
<s>  and im sure we all
are and pity yer very much </s>
<s>   but yer must know workus yer mother
was a regular rightdown bad un </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s>  inquired oliver looking up very quickly </s>
<s> 

a regular rightdown bad un workus replied noah coolly </s>
<s>  and
its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else
shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung </s>
<s> 
which is more likely than either isnt it </s>
<s> 

crimson with fury oliver started up </s>
<s>  overthrew the chair and table </s>
<s> 
seized noah by the throat </s>
<s>  shook him in the violence of his rage till
his teeth chattered in his head </s>
<s>  and collecting his whole force into
one heavy blow felled him to the ground </s>
<s> 

a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected
creature that harsh treatment had made him </s>
<s>   but his spirit was roused
at last </s>
<s>  the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire </s>
<s> 
his breast heaved </s>
<s>  his attitude was erect </s>
<s>  his eye bright and vivid </s>
<s> 
his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly
tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet </s>
<s>  and defied him with an
energy he had never known before </s>
<s> 

hell murder me </s>
<s>  blubbered noah </s>
<s>   charlotte </s>
<s>   missis </s>
<s>   heres the
new boy a murdering of me </s>
<s>   help </s>
<s>  help </s>
<s>   olivers gone mad </s>
<s> 
charlotte </s>
<s> 

noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a
louder from <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was
quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human
life to come further down </s>
<s> 

oh you little wretch </s>
<s>  screamed charlotte </s>
<s>  seizing oliver with her
utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man
in particularly good training </s>
<s>   oh you little ungrateful
murderous horrid villain </s>
<s>   and between every syllable charlotte
gave oliver a blow with all her might </s>
<s>  accompanying it with a scream
for the benefit of society </s>
<s> 

charlottes fist was by no means a light one </s>
<s>  but lest it should not
be effectual in calming olivers wrath <abvr> sowerberry plunged into
the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she
scratched his face with the other </s>
<s>  in this favourable position of
affairs noah rose from the ground and pommelled him behind </s>
<s> 

this was rather too violent exercise to last long </s>
<s>   when they were all
wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver
struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and
there locked him up </s>
<s>   this being done <abvr> sowerberry sunk into a
chair and burst into tears </s>
<s> 

bless her shes going off </s>
<s>  said charlotte </s>
<s>   a glass of water noah
dear </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   charlotte said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   speaking as well as she could
through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which
noah had poured over her head and shoulders </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  charlotte what a
mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  mercy indeed maam was the reply </s>
<s>   i only hope thisll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle </s>
<s>  poor noah </s>
<s>   he was
all but killed maam when i come in </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  looking piteously on the
charityboy </s>
<s> 

noah whose top waistcoatbutton might have been somewhere on a level
with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his
wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed
some affecting tears and sniffs </s>
<s> 

whats to be done </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>   your masters not at
home </s>
<s>  theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in
ten minutes </s>
<s>   olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
question rendered this occurance highly probable </s>
<s> 

dear dear </s>
<s>   i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for
the policeofficers </s>
<s> 

or the millingtary suggested <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

no no said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s>  bethinking herself of olivers old
friend </s>
<s>   run to <abvr> bumble noah and tell him to come here directly
and not to lose a minute </s>
<s>  never mind your cap </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s>   you can
hold a knife to that black eye as you run along </s>
<s>  itll keep the
swelling down </s>
<s> 

noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed </s>
<s> 
and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a
charityboy tearing through the streets pellmell with no cap on his
head and a claspknife at his eye </s>
<s> 



chapter vii

oliver continues refractory

noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused
not once for breath until he reached the workhousegate </s>
<s>  having rested
here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an
imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket </s>
<s>  and
presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that
even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of
times started back in astonishment </s>
<s> 

why whats the matter with the boy </s>
<s>  said the old pauper </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  cried noah with wellaffected dismay </s>
<s>  and
in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of <abvr>
bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much
that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hatwhich is a very
curious and remarkable circumstance </s>
<s>  as showing that even a beadle
acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a
momentary visitation of loss of selfpossession and forgetfulness of
personal dignity </s>
<s> 

oh <abvr> bumble sir </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   oliver siroliver has

what </s>
<s>   what </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  with a gleam of pleasure in his
metallic eyes </s>
<s>  not run away </s>
<s>  he hasnt run away has he noah </s>
<s> 

no sir no </s>
<s>   not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied
noah </s>
<s>  he tried to murder me sir </s>
<s>  and then he tried to murder
charlotte </s>
<s>  and then missis </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  what dreadful pain it is </s>
<s> 

such agony please sir </s>
<s>   and here noah writhed and twisted his body
into an extensive variety of eellike positions </s>
<s>  thereby giving <abvr>
bumble to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of
oliver twist he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from
which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture </s>
<s> 

when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed
mr </s>
<s>  bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his
dreadful wounds ten times louder than before </s>
<s>  and when he observed a
gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in
his lamentations than ever </s>
<s>  rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman
aforesaid </s>
<s> 

the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted </s>
<s>  for he had not walked
three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young
cur was howling for and why <abvr> bumble did not favour him with
something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so
designated an involuntary process </s>
<s> 

its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied <abvr> bumble who
has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist </s>
<s> 

by jove </s>
<s>  exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping
short </s>
<s>   i knew it </s>
<s>   i felt a strange presentiment from the very first
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung </s>
<s> 

he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said
mr </s>
<s>  bumble with a face of ashy paleness </s>
<s> 

and his missis interposed <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

and his master too i think you said noah </s>
<s>  added <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah </s>
<s>  he said
he wanted to </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   said he wanted to did he my boy </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman in the
white waistcoat </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied noah </s>
<s>   and please sir missis wants to know
whether <abvr> bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog
himcause masters out </s>
<s> 

certainly my boy </s>
<s>  certainly said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat </s>
<s>  smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about
three inches higher than his own </s>
<s>   youre a good boya very good boy </s>
<s> 
heres a penny for you </s>
<s>   bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your
cane and see whats best to be done </s>
<s>  dont spare him bumble </s>
<s> 

no i will not sir replied the beadle </s>
<s>   and the cocked hat and cane
having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction <abvr>
bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
undertakers shop </s>
<s> 

here the position of affairs had not at all improved </s>
<s>   sowerberry had
not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished
vigour at the cellardoor </s>
<s>   the accounts of his ferocity as related by
mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that <abvr>
bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door </s>
<s>   with this
view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude </s>
<s>  and then
applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  you let me out </s>
<s>  replied oliver from the inside </s>
<s> 

do you know this here voice oliver </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

yes replied oliver </s>
<s> 

aint you afraid of it sir </s>
<s>   aint you atrembling while i speak
sir </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  replied oliver boldly </s>
<s> 

an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was
in the habit of receiving staggered <abvr> bumble not a little </s>
<s>   he
stepped back from the keyhole </s>
<s>  drew himself up to his full height </s>
<s>  and
looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute
astonishment </s>
<s> 

oh you know <abvr> bumble he must be mad said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you </s>
<s> 

its not madness maam replied <abvr> bumble after a few moments of
deep meditation </s>
<s>   its meat </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis </s>
<s>  youve
overfed him maam </s>
<s>   youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in
him maam unbecoming a person of his condition </s>
<s>  as the board <abvr>
sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you </s>
<s>   what have
paupers to do with soul or spirit </s>
<s>   its quite enough that we let em
have live bodies </s>
<s>   if you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would
never have happened </s>
<s> 

dear dear </s>
<s>  ejaculated <abvr> sowerberry piously raising her eyes to
the kitchen ceiling </s>
<s>  this comes of being liberal </s>
<s> 

the liberality of <abvr> sowerberry to oliver had consisted of a profuse
bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else
would eat </s>
<s>  so there was a great deal of meekness and selfdevotion in
her voluntarily remaining under <abvr> bumbles heavy accusation </s>
<s>   of
which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or
deed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth
again </s>
<s>  the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to
leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved
down </s>
<s>  and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the
apprenticeship </s>
<s>   he comes of a bad family </s>
<s>  excitable natures <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his
made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed
any welldisposed woman weeks before </s>
<s> 

at this point of <abvr> bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced
kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible </s>
<s> 
sowerberry returned at this juncture </s>
<s>   olivers offence having been
explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best
calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a
twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar </s>
<s> 

olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received </s>
<s>  his face
was bruised and scratched </s>
<s>  and his hair scattered over his forehead </s>
<s> 
the angry flush had not disappeared however </s>
<s>  and when he was pulled
out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite
undismayed </s>
<s> 

now you are a nice young fellow aint you </s>
<s>  said sowerberry </s>
<s>  giving
oliver a shake and a box on the ear </s>
<s> 

he called my mother names replied oliver </s>
<s> 

well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
sowerberry </s>
<s>   she deserved what he said and worse </s>
<s> 

she didnt said oliver </s>
<s> 

she did said <abvr> sowerberry </s>
<s> 

its a lie </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  sowerberry burst into a flood of tears </s>
<s> 

this flood of tears left <abvr> sowerberry no alternative </s>
<s>   if he had
hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be
quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been
according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a
brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of
a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital
within the limits of this </s>
<s> </s>
<s>   to do him justice he was as far
as his power wentit was not very extensivekindly disposed towards
the boy </s>
<s>  perhaps because it was his interest to be so </s>
<s>  perhaps
because his wife disliked him </s>
<s>  the flood of tears however left him no
resource </s>
<s>  so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even <abvr>
sowerberry herself and rendered <abvr> bumbles subsequent application of
the parochial cane rather unnecessary </s>
<s>   for the rest of the day he
was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of
bread </s>
<s>  and at night <abvr> sowerberry after making various remarks
outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his
mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of
noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed </s>
<s> 

it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings
which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a
mere child </s>
<s>   he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt </s>
<s> 
he had borne the lash without a cry </s>
<s>  for he felt that pride swelling in
his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they
had roasted him alive </s>
<s>   but now when there were none to see or hear
him he fell upon his knees on the floor </s>
<s>  and hiding his face in his
hands wept such tears as god send for the credit of our nature few
so young may ever have cause to pour out before him </s>
<s> 

for a long time oliver remained motionless in this attitude </s>
<s>  the
candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet </s>
<s>  having
gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the
fastenings of the door and looked abroad </s>
<s> 

it was a cold dark night </s>
<s>   the stars seemed to the boys eyes
farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before </s>
<s>  there was no
wind </s>
<s>  and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground
looked sepulchral and deathlike from being so still </s>
<s>  he softly
reclosed the door </s>
<s>   having availed himself of the expiring light of the
candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel
he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for morning </s>
<s> 

with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
shutters oliver arose and again unbarred the door </s>
<s>   one timid look
aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him
and was in the open street </s>
<s> 

he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly </s>
<s> 

he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up
the hill </s>
<s>   he took the same route </s>
<s>  and arriving at a footpath across
the fields </s>
<s>  which he knew after some distance led out again into the
road </s>
<s>  struck into it and walked quickly on </s>
<s> 

along this same footpath oliver wellremembered he had trotted beside
mr </s>
<s>  bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm </s>
<s> 
his way lay directly in front of the cottage </s>
<s>  his heart beat quickly
when he bethought himself of this </s>
<s>  and he half resolved to turn back </s>
<s> 
he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by
doing so </s>
<s>   besides it was so early that there was very little fear of
his being seen </s>
<s>  so he walked on </s>
<s> 

he reached the house </s>
<s>   there was no appearance of its inmates stirring
at that early hour </s>
<s>   oliver stopped and peeped into the garden </s>
<s>   a
child was weeding one of the little beds </s>
<s>  as he stopped he raised his
pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions </s>
<s> 
oliver felt glad to see him before he went </s>
<s>  for though younger than
himself he had been his little friend and playmate </s>
<s>   they had been
beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time </s>
<s> 

hush dick </s>
<s>  said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his
thin arm between the rails to greet him </s>
<s>   is any one up </s>
<s> 

nobody but me replied the child </s>
<s> 

you musnt say you saw me dick said oliver </s>
<s>   i am running away </s>
<s> 
they beat and illuse me dick </s>
<s>  and i am going to seek my fortune some
long way off </s>
<s>   i dont know where </s>
<s>   how pale you are </s>
<s> 

i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a
faint smile </s>
<s>   i am very glad to see you dear </s>
<s>  but dont stop dont
stop </s>
<s> 

yes yes i will to say goodbye to you replied oliver </s>
<s>  i shall
see you again dick </s>
<s>   i know i shall </s>
<s>   you will be well and happy </s>
<s> 

i hope so replied the child </s>
<s>   after i am dead but not before </s>
<s>   i
know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of
heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake </s>
<s> 
kiss me said the child  climbing up the low gate and flinging his
little arms round olivers neck </s>
<s>  goodbye dear </s>
<s>   god bless you </s>
<s> 

the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that
oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head </s>
<s>  and through the struggles
and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never
once forgot it </s>

chapter viii

oliver walks to london </s>
<s>   he encounters on the road a strange sort of
young gentleman

oliver reached the stile at which the bypath terminated </s>
<s>  and once more
gained the highroad </s>
<s>   it was eight oclock now </s>
<s>  though he was nearly
five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by
turns till noon </s>
<s>  fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken </s>
<s>   then
he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think
for the first time where he had better go and try to live </s>
<s> 

the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an
intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london </s>
<s>  the
name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind </s>
<s> 

london </s>
<s> that great place </s>
<s> nobodynot even <abvr> bumblecould ever
find him there </s>
<s>   he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too
say that no lad of spirit need want in london </s>
<s>  and that there were ways
of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in
country parts had no idea of </s>
<s>   it was the very place for a homeless
boy who must die in the streets unless some one helped him </s>
<s>  as these
things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again
walked forward </s>
<s> 

he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four
miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could
hope to reach his place of destination </s>
<s>  as this consideration forced
itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his
means of getting there </s>
<s>   he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and
two pairs of stockings in his bundle </s>
<s>   he had a penny tooa gift of
sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more
than ordinarily wellin his pocket </s>
<s>  a clean shirt thought oliver
is a very comfortable thing </s>
<s>  and so are two pairs of darned stockings </s>
<s> 
and so is a penny </s>
<s>  but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk
in winter time </s>
<s>   but olivers thoughts like those of most other
people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his
difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
surmounting them </s>
<s>  so after a good deal of thinking to no particular
purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and
trudged on </s>
<s> 

oliver walked twenty miles that day </s>
<s>  and all that time tasted nothing
but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he
begged at the cottagedoors by the roadside </s>
<s>   when the night came he
turned into a meadow </s>
<s>  and creeping close under a hayrick determined
to lie there till morning </s>
<s>   he felt frightened at first for the wind
moaned dismally over the empty fields </s>
<s>  and he was cold and hungry and
more alone than he had ever felt before </s>
<s>   being very tired with his
walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles </s>
<s> 

he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that
he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very
first village through which he passed </s>
<s>   he had walked no more than
twelve miles when night closed in again </s>
<s>  his feet were sore and his
legs so weak that they trembled beneath him </s>
<s>   another night passed in
the bleak damp air made him worse </s>
<s>  when he set forward on his journey
next morning he could hardly crawl along </s>
<s> 

he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and
then begged of the outside passengers </s>
<s>  but there were very few who took
any notice of him </s>
<s>  and even those told him to wait till they got to the
top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a
halfpenny </s>
<s>   poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way
but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet </s>
<s>   when
the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets
again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve
anything </s>
<s>  and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
behind </s>
<s> 

in some villages large painted boards were fixed up </s>
<s>  warning all
persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to
jail </s>
<s>   this frightened oliver very much and made him glad to get out
of those villages with all possible expedition </s>
<s>   in others he would
stand about the innyards and look mournfully at every one who passed </s>
<s> 
a proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one
of the postboys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out
of the place for she was sure he had come to steal something </s>
<s>   if he
begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him </s>
<s>  and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about
the beadlewhich brought olivers heart into his mouthvery often
the only thing he had there for many hours together </s>
<s> 

in fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpikeman and a
benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the
very same process which had put an end to his mothers </s>
<s>  in other words
he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway </s>
<s>   but
the turnpikeman gave him a meal of bread and cheese </s>
<s>  and the old lady
who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part
of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little
she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words and such
tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers
soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone </s>
<s> 

early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver
limped slowly into the little town of barnet </s>
<s>  the windowshutters were
closed </s>
<s>  the street was empty </s>
<s>  not a soul had awakened to the business
of the day </s>
<s>   the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty </s>
<s>  but the
light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation
as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep </s>
<s> 

by degrees the shutters were opened </s>
<s>  the windowblinds were drawn up </s>
<s> 
and people began passing to and fro </s>
<s>   some few stopped to gaze at
oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they
hurried by </s>
<s>  but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire
how he came there </s>
<s>  he had no heart to beg </s>
<s>  and there he sat </s>
<s> 

he had been crouching on the step for some time </s>
<s>  wondering at the great
number of publichouses every other house in barnet was a tavern
large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed
through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with
ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and
determination beyond his years to accomplish </s>
<s>  when he was roused by
observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes
before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the
opposite side of the way </s>
<s>   he took little heed of this at first </s>
<s>  but
the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long
that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look </s>
<s>   upon this
the boy crossed over </s>
<s>  and walking close up to oliver said

hullo my covey </s>
<s>   whats the row </s>
<s> 

the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his
own age </s>
<s>  but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even
seen </s>
<s>   he was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough </s>
<s>  and
as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see </s>
<s>  but he had about him all
the airs and manners of a man </s>
<s>   he was short of his age </s>
<s>  with rather
bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes </s>
<s>   his hat was stuck on the top
of his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every
momentand would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a
knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which
brought it back to its old place again </s>
<s>   he wore a mans coat which
reached nearly to his heels </s>
<s>   he had turned the cuffs back halfway up
his arm to get his hands out of the sleeves </s>
<s>  apparently with the
ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy
trousers </s>
<s>  for there he kept them </s>
<s>   he was altogether as roystering
and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six or
something less in the bluchers </s>
<s> 

hullo my covey </s>
<s>   whats the row </s>
<s>  said this strange young gentleman
to oliver </s>
<s> 

i am very hungry and tired replied oliver </s>
<s>  the tears standing in his
eyes as he spoke </s>
<s>  i have walked a long way </s>
<s>   i have been walking these
seven days </s>
<s> 

walking for sivin days </s>
<s>  said the young gentleman </s>
<s>   oh i see </s>
<s>  beaks
order eh </s>
<s>   but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i
suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion </s>
<s> 

oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth
described by the term in question </s>
<s> 

my eyes how green </s>
<s>  exclaimed the young gentleman </s>
<s>  why a beaks a
madgstrate </s>
<s>  and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight
forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin </s>
<s>   was you
never on the mill </s>
<s> 

what mill </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

what mill </s>
<s>   why the millthe mill as takes up so little room that
itll work inside a stone jug </s>
<s>  and always goes better when the winds
low with people than when its high </s>
<s>  acos then they cant get workmen </s>
<s> 
but come said the young gentleman </s>
<s>  you want grub and you shall have
it </s>
<s>   im at lowwatermark myselfonly one bob and a magpie </s>
<s>  but as
far as it goes ill fork out and stump </s>
<s>   up with you on your pins </s>
<s> 
there </s>
<s>   now then </s>
<s>  morrice </s>
<s> 

assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of readydressed ham
and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny
bran </s>
<s>  the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the
ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a
portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein </s>
<s>   taking the bread under
his arm the young gentlman turned into a small publichouse and led
the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises </s>
<s>  here a pot of beer
was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth </s>
<s>  and oliver
falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal
during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time
with great attention </s>
<s> 

going to london </s>
<s>  said the strange boy when oliver had at length
concluded </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

got any lodgings </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

money </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

the strange boy whistled </s>
<s>  and put his arms into his pockets as far as
the big coatsleeves would let them go </s>
<s> 

do you live in london </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i do when im at home replied the boy </s>
<s>  i suppose you want
some place to sleep in tonight dont you </s>
<s> 

i do indeed answered oliver </s>
<s>  i have not slept under a roof since i
left the country </s>
<s> 

dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman </s>
<s> 
ive got to be in london tonight </s>
<s>  and i know a spectable old
gentleman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and
never ask for the changethat is if any genelman he knows interduces
you </s>
<s>  and dont he know me </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s>  not in the least </s>
<s>   by no means </s>
<s> 
certainly not </s>
<s> 

the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments
of discourse were playfully ironical </s>
<s>  and finished the beer as he did
so </s>
<s> 

this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted </s>
<s> 
especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the
old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a
comfortable place without loss of time </s>
<s>   this led to a more friendly
and confidential dialogue </s>
<s>  from which oliver discovered that his
friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and
protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dawkins appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the
comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took
under his protection </s>
<s>  but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute
mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate
friends he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger
oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the
moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
him </s>
<s>   under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good
opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible </s>
<s>  and if he found
the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to
decline the honour of his farther acquaintance </s>
<s> 

as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it
was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington </s>
<s> 
they crossed from the angel into st </s>
<s>  johns road </s>
<s>  struck down the small
street which terminates at sadlers wells theatre </s>
<s>  through exmouth
street and coppice row </s>
<s>  down the little court by the side of the
workhouse </s>
<s>  across the classic ground which once bore the name of
hockleyinthehole </s>
<s>  thence into little saffron hill </s>
<s>  and so into
saffron hill the great </s>
<s>  along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace
directing oliver to follow close at his heels </s>
<s> 

although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
side of the way as he passed along </s>
<s>   a dirtier or more wretched place
he had never seen </s>
<s>   the street was very narrow and muddy and the air
was impregnated with filthy odours </s>
<s> 

there were a good many small shops </s>
<s>  but the only stock in trade
appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were
crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside </s>
<s>   the
sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the
place were the publichouses </s>
<s>  and in them the lowest orders of irish
were wrangling with might and main </s>
<s>  covered ways and yards which here
and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of
houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth </s>
<s> 
and from several of the doorways great illlooking fellows were
cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very welldisposed
or harmless errands </s>
<s> 

oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when
they reached the bottom of the hill </s>
<s>   his conductor catching him by
the arm pushed open the door of a house near field lane </s>
<s>  and drawing
him into the passage closed it behind them </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the
dodger </s>
<s> 

plummy and slam </s>
<s>  was the reply </s>
<s> 

this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right </s>
<s>  for the
light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
passage </s>
<s>  and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the
old kitchen staircase had been broken away </s>
<s> 

theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out
and shielding his eyes with his hand </s>
<s>   whos the tother one </s>
<s> 

a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward </s>
<s> 

where did he come from </s>
<s> 

greenland </s>
<s>  is fagin upstairs </s>
<s> 

yes hes a sortin the wipes </s>
<s>   up with you </s>
<s>   the candle was drawn
back and the face disappeared </s>
<s> 

oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly
grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and
broken stairs </s>
<s>  which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition
that showed he was well acquainted with them </s>
<s> 

he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him </s>
<s> 

the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and
dirt </s>
<s>   there was a deal table before the fire </s>
<s>  upon which were a
candle stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf
and butter and a plate </s>
<s>   in a fryingpan which was on the fire and
which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were
cooking </s>
<s>  and standing over them with a toastingfork in his hand was
a very old shrivelled jew whose villainouslooking and repulsive face
was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair </s>
<s>  he was dressed in a
greasy flannel gown with his throat bare </s>
<s>  and seemed to be dividing
his attention between the fryingpan and the clotheshorse over which
a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging </s>
<s>   several rough beds
made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor </s>
<s>  seated round
the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking
long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men </s>
<s> 
these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to
the jew </s>
<s>  and then turned round and grinned at oliver </s>
<s>   so did the jew
himself toastingfork in hand </s>
<s> 

this is him fagin said jack dawkins </s>
<s> my friend oliver twist </s>
<s> 

the jew grinned </s>
<s>  and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the
hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance </s>
<s> 
upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook
both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his
little bundle </s>
<s>   one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap
for him </s>
<s>  and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his
pockets in order that as he was very tired he might not have the
trouble of emptying them himself when he went to bed </s>
<s>   these
civilities would probably be extended much farther but for a liberal
exercise of the jews toastingfork on the heads and shoulders of the
affectionate youths who offered them </s>
<s> 

we are very glad to see you oliver very said the jew </s>
<s>  dodger
take off the sausages </s>
<s>  and draw a tub near the fire for oliver </s>
<s>   ah
youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s>  eh my dear </s>
<s>  there are a
good many of em aint there </s>
<s>  weve just looked em out ready for the
wash </s>
<s>  thats all oliver </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from
all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman </s>
<s>  in the midst of
which they went to supper </s>
<s> 

oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot
ginandwater </s>
<s>  telling him he must drink it off directly because
another gentleman wanted the tumbler </s>
<s>  oliver did as he was desired </s>
<s> 
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the
sacks </s>
<s>  and then he sunk into a deep sleep </s>
<s> 



chapter ix

containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman
and his hopeful pupils

it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep </s>
<s> 
there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to
himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon </s>
<s>  he would
stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below </s>
<s> 
and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and
stirring again as before </s>
<s> 

although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly
awake </s>
<s>  there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you
dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half
conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in
five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in
perfect unconsciousness </s>
<s>  at such time a mortal knows just enough of
what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its
mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space
when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate </s>
<s> 

oliver was precisely in this condition </s>
<s>  he saw the jew with his
halfclosed eyes </s>
<s>  heard his low whistling </s>
<s>  and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepans sides </s>
<s>  and yet the selfsame
senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with
almost everybody he had ever known </s>
<s> 

when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob </s>
<s> 
standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he
did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at
oliver and called him by his name </s>
<s>  he did not answer and was to all
appearances asleep </s>
<s> 

after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the
door </s>
<s>  which he fastened </s>
<s>  he then drew forth </s>
<s>  as it seemed to oliver
from some trap in the floor </s>
<s>  a small box which he placed carefully on
the table </s>
<s>  his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in </s>
<s> 
dragging an old chair to the table he sat down </s>
<s>  and took from it a
magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every
feature with a hideous grin </s>
<s>  clever dogs </s>
<s>  clever dogs </s>
<s>  staunch to the
last </s>
<s>  never told the old parson where they were </s>
<s>  never poached upon old
fagin </s>
<s>  and why should they </s>
<s>  it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept
the drop up a minute longer </s>
<s>  no no no </s>
<s>  fine fellows </s>
<s>  fine fellows </s>
<s> 

with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew
once more deposited the watch in its place of safety </s>
<s>  at least half a
dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed
with equal pleasure </s>
<s>  besides rings brooches bracelets and other
articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly
workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names </s>
<s> 

having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another </s>
<s>  so small that
it lay in the palm of his hand </s>
<s>  there seemed to be some very minute
inscription on it </s>
<s>  for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading
it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly </s>
<s>  at length he put
it down as if despairing of success </s>
<s>  and leaning back in his chair
muttered </s>
<s> 

what a fine thing capital punishment is </s>
<s>  dead men never repent </s>
<s>  dead
men never bring awkward stories to light </s>
<s>  ah its a fine thing for the
trade </s>
<s>  five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or
turn whitelivered </s>
<s> 

as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been
staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face </s>
<s>  the boys eyes were
fixed on his in mute curiousity </s>
<s>  and although the recognition was only
for an instantfor the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceivedit was enough to show the old man that he had been observed </s>
<s> 

he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash </s>
<s>  and laying his hand on
a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up </s>
<s>  he trembled
very much though </s>
<s>  for even in his terror oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>  what do you watch me for </s>
<s>  why are you
awake </s>
<s>  what have you seen </s>
<s>  speak out boy </s>
<s>  quickquick </s>
<s>  for your life </s>
<s> 

i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly </s>
<s>  i am
very sorry if i have disturbed you sir </s>
<s> 

you were not awake an hour ago </s>
<s>  said the jew scowling fiercely on
the boy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s>  replied oliver </s>
<s> 

are you sure </s>
<s>  cried the jew </s>
<s>  with a still fiercer look than before </s>
<s> 
and a threatening attitude </s>
<s> 

upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly </s>
<s>  i was not
indeed sir </s>
<s> 

tush tush my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner
and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down </s>
<s>  as if to
induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport </s>
<s>  of course i
know that my dear </s>
<s>  i only tried to frighten you </s>
<s>  youre a brave boy </s>
<s> 
ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  youre a brave boy oliver </s>
<s>  the jew rubbed his hands with a
chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding </s>
<s> 

did you see any of these pretty things my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew laying
his hand upon it after a short pause </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning rather pale </s>
<s>  theytheyre mine oliver </s>
<s> 
my little property </s>
<s>  all i have to live upon in my old age </s>
<s>  the folks
call me a miser my dear </s>
<s>  only a miser </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
such a dirty place with so many watches </s>
<s>  but thinking that perhaps
his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of
money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he
might get up </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  stay </s>
<s> 
theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door </s>
<s>  bring it here </s>
<s> 
and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear </s>
<s> 

oliver got up </s>
<s>  walked across the room </s>
<s>  and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher </s>
<s>   when he turned his head the box was gone </s>
<s> 

he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying
the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when
the dodger returned </s>
<s>  accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom
oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally
introduced to him as charley bates </s>
<s>  the four sat down to breakfast on
the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought
home in the crown of his hat </s>
<s> 

well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself
to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears </s>
<s> 

hard replied the dodger </s>
<s> 

as nails added charley bates </s>
<s> 

good boys good boys </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>  what have you got dodger </s>
<s> 

a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentlman </s>
<s> 

lined </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with eagerness </s>
<s> 

pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks </s>
<s>  one
green and the other red </s>
<s> 

not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the
insides carefully </s>
<s>  but very neat and nicely made </s>
<s>   ingenious workman
aint he oliver </s>
<s> 

very indeed sir said oliver </s>
<s>  at which <abvr> charles bates laughed
uproariously </s>
<s>  very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to
laugh at in anything that had passed </s>
<s> 

and what have you got my dear </s>
<s>  said fagin to charley bates </s>
<s> 

wipes replied master bates </s>
<s>  at the same time producing four
pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s> 

well said the jew inspecting them closely </s>
<s>  theyre very good ones
very </s>
<s>  you havent marked them well though charley </s>
<s>  so the marks shall
be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it </s>
<s>  shall
us oliver eh </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

if you please sir said oliver </s>
<s> 

youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as charley
bates wouldnt you my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s> 

very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that
he burst into another laugh </s>
<s>  which laugh meeting the coffee he was
drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly
terminated in his premature suffocation </s>
<s> 

he is so jolly green </s>
<s>  said charley when he recovered as an apology
to the company for his unpolite behaviour </s>
<s> 

the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes
and said hed know better by and by </s>
<s>  upon which the old gentleman
observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking
whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning </s>
<s> 
this made him wonder more and more </s>
<s>  for it was plain from the replies
of the two boys that they had both been there </s>
<s>  and oliver naturally
wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
industrious </s>
<s> 

when the breakfast was cleared away </s>
<s>  the merry old gentlman and the two
boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in
this way </s>
<s>  the merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of
his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat
pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his shirt </s>
<s>  buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his
spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the
room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walk about the streets any hour in the day </s>
<s>   sometimes he stopped at
the fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was
staring with all his might into shopwindows </s>
<s>   at such times he would
look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping
all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a
very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran
down his face </s>
<s>   all this time the two boys followed him closely about </s>
<s> 
getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that
it was impossible to follow their motions </s>
<s>  at last the dodger trod
upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while charley bates
stumbled up against him behind </s>
<s>  and in that one moment they took from
him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase
watchguard chain shirtpin pockethandkerchief even the
spectaclecase </s>
<s>   if the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his
pockets he cried out where it was </s>
<s>  and then the game began all over
again </s>
<s> 

when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young
ladies called to see the young gentleman </s>
<s>  one of whom was named bet
and the other nancy </s>
<s>   they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly
turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings </s>
<s> 
they were not exactly pretty perhaps </s>
<s>  but they had a great deal of
colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty </s>
<s>   being
remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them
very nice girls indeed </s>
<s>   as there is no doubt they were </s>
<s> 

the visitors stopped a long time </s>
<s>  spirits were produced in consequence
of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside </s>
<s>  and
the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn </s>
<s>  at length
charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof </s>
<s> 
this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out </s>
<s>  for directly
afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went
away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with
money to spend </s>
<s> 

there my dear said fagin </s>
<s>  thats a pleasant life isnt it </s>
<s>  they
have gone out for the day </s>
<s> 

have they done work sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew </s>
<s>  that is unless they should unexpectedly come
across any when they are out </s>
<s>  and they wont neglect it if they do
my dear depend upon it </s>
<s>   make em your models my dear </s>
<s>  make em your
models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his
words </s>
<s>  do everything they bid you and take their advice in all
mattersespecially the dodgers my dear </s>
<s>  hell be a great man
himself and will make you one too if you take pattern by him </s>
<s> is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew stopping
short </s>
<s> 

yes sir said oliver </s>
<s> 

see if you can take it out without my feeling it </s>
<s>  as you saw them do
when we were at play this morning </s>
<s> 

oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen
the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with
the other </s>
<s> 

is it gone </s>
<s>  cried the jew </s>
<s> 

here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand </s>
<s> 

youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting
oliver on the head approvingly </s>
<s>  i never saw a sharper lad </s>
<s>  heres a
shilling for you </s>
<s>  if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man
of the time </s>
<s>  and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks
out of the handkerchiefs </s>
<s> 

oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to
do with his chances of being a great man </s>
<s>   but thinking that the jew
being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to
the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study </s>
<s> 



chapter x

oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new
associates </s>
<s>  and purchases experience at a high price </s>
<s>  being a short
but very important </s>
<s> in this history

for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out
of the pockethandkerchief of which a great number were brought
home and sometimes taking part in the game already described </s>
<s>  which
the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning </s>
<s>  at length
he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of
earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work
with his two companions </s>
<s> 

oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what
he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character </s>
<s> 
whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night emptyhanded
he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits </s>
<s>  and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by
sending them supperless to bed </s>
<s>  on one occasion indeed he even went
so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs </s>
<s>  but this was
carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent </s>
<s> 

at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so
eagerly sought </s>
<s>  there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two
or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre </s>
<s>  perhaps these
were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent </s>
<s>  but whether
they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the
joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger </s>
<s> 

the three boys sallied out </s>
<s>  the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up
and his hat cocked as usual </s>
<s>  master bates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets </s>
<s>  and oliver between them wondering where they
were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in
first </s>
<s> 

the pace at which they went was such a very lazy illlooking saunter
that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive
the old gentleman by not going to work at all </s>
<s>  the dodger had a
vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small
boys and tossing them down areas </s>
<s>  while charley bates exhibited some
very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering
divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and
thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that
they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction </s>
<s> 
these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring
his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could </s>
<s>  when
his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very
mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger </s>
<s> 

they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion
of terms the green </s>
<s>  when the dodger made a sudden stop </s>
<s>  and laying
his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the
greatest caution and circumspection </s>
<s> 

whats the matter </s>
<s>  demanded oliver </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  replied the dodger </s>
<s>  do you see that old cove at the
bookstall </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman over the way </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  yes i see him </s>
<s> 

hell do said the dodger </s>
<s> 

a prime plant observed master charley bates </s>
<s> 

oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise </s>
<s>  but he
was not permitted to make any inquiries </s>
<s>  for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman
towards whom his attention had been directed </s>
<s>  oliver walked a few paces
after them </s>
<s>  and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood
looking on in silent amazement </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a
powdered head and gold spectacles </s>
<s>  he was dressed in a bottlegreen
coat with a black velvet collar </s>
<s>  wore white trousers </s>
<s>  and carried a
smart bamboo cane under his arm </s>
<s>  he had taken up a book from the stall
and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his
elbowchair in his own study </s>
<s>  it is very possible that he fancied
himself there indeed </s>
<s>  for it was plain from his abstraction that he
saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short
anything but the book itself </s>
<s>  which he was reading straight through </s>
<s> 
turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at
the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest
interest and eagerness </s>
<s> 

what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking
on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the
dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from
thence a handkerchief </s>
<s>  to see him hand the same to charley bates </s>
<s>  and
finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full
speed </s>
<s> 

in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches
and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind </s>
<s> 

he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his
veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire </s>
<s>  then
confused and frightened he took to his heels </s>
<s>  and not knowing what he
did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground </s>
<s> 

this was all done in a minutes space </s>
<s>  in the very instant when oliver
began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and
missing his handkerchief turned sharp round </s>
<s>  seeing the boy scudding
away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the
depredator </s>
<s>  and shouting stop thief </s>
<s>  with all his might made off
after him book in hand </s>
<s> 

but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
hueandcry </s>
<s>  the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public
attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the
very first doorway round the corner </s>
<s>  they no sooner heard the cry and
saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they
issued forth with great promptitude </s>
<s>  and shouting stop thief </s>
<s>  too
joined in the pursuit like good citizens </s>
<s> 

although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not
theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that
selfpreservation is the first law of nature </s>
<s>  if he had been perhaps
he would have been prepared for this </s>
<s>  not being prepared however it
alarmed him the more </s>
<s>  so away he went like the wind with the old
gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  there is a magic in the sound </s>
<s>  the tradesman
leaves his counter and the carman his waggon </s>
<s>  the butcher throws down
his tray </s>
<s>  the baker his basket </s>
<s>  the milkman his pail </s>
<s>  the errandboy
his parcels </s>
<s>  the schoolboy his marbles </s>
<s>  the paviour his pickaxe </s>
<s>  the
child his battledore </s>
<s>  away they run pellmell helterskelter
slapdash </s>
<s>  tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as
they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls </s>
<s> 
and streets squares and courts reecho with the sound </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and
the crowd accumulate at every turning </s>
<s>  away they fly splashing through
the mud and rattling along the pavements </s>
<s>  up go the windows out run
the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the
very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the
shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s> 

stop thief </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>  there is a passion for hunting something
deeply implanted in the human breast </s>
<s>   one wretched breathless child
panting with exhaustion </s>
<s>  terror in his looks </s>
<s>  agony in his eyes </s>
<s>  large
drops of perspiration streaming down his face </s>
<s>  strains every nerve to
make head upon his pursuers </s>
<s>  and as they follow on his track and gain
upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy </s>
<s> 
stop thief </s>
<s>   ay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy </s>
<s> 

stopped at last </s>
<s>   a clever blow </s>
<s>   he is down upon the pavement </s>
<s>  and the
crowd eagerly gather round him </s>
<s>   each new comer jostling and
struggling with the others to catch a glimpse </s>
<s>   stand aside </s>
<s>   give
him a little air </s>
<s>   nonsense </s>
<s>  he dont deserve it </s>
<s>   wheres the
gentleman </s>
<s>   here his is coming down the street </s>
<s>   make room there
for the gentleman </s>
<s>  is this the boy sir </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth
looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers </s>
<s> 

yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy </s>
<s> 

afraid </s>
<s>  murmured the crowd </s>
<s>   thats a good un </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said the gentleman he has hurt himself </s>
<s> 

i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward </s>
<s> 
and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth </s>
<s>   i stopped him sir </s>
<s> 

the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his
pains </s>
<s>  but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of
dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away
himself </s>
<s>   which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and
thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is
generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made
his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar </s>
<s> 

come get up said the man roughly </s>
<s> 

it wasnt me indeed sir </s>
<s>   indeed indeed it was two other boys
said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round </s>
<s>   they
are here somewhere </s>
<s> 

oh no they aint said the officer </s>
<s>   he meant this to be ironical
but it was true besides </s>
<s>  for the dodger and charley bates had filed off
down the first convenient court they came to </s>
<s> 

come get up </s>
<s> 

dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately </s>
<s> 

oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half
off his back in proof thereof </s>
<s>   come i know you </s>
<s>  it wont do </s>
<s>   will
you stand upon your legs you young devil </s>
<s> 

oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his
feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at
a rapid pace </s>
<s>   the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side </s>
<s> 
and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead
and stared back at oliver from time to time </s>
<s>   the boys shouted in
triumph </s>
<s>  and on they went </s>
<s> 



chapter xi

treats of <abvr> fang the police magistrate </s>
<s>  and furnishes a slight
specimen of his mode of administering justice

the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the
immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office </s>
<s> 
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two
or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led
beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of
summary justice by the back way </s>
<s>   it was a small paved yard into which
they turned </s>
<s>  and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  said the man carelessly </s>
<s> 

a young foglehunter replied the man who had oliver in charge </s>
<s> 

are you the party thats been robbed sir </s>
<s>  inquired the man with the
keys </s>
<s> 

yes i am replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>  but i am not sure that this
boy actually took the handkerchief </s>
<s>   ii would rather not press the
case </s>
<s> 

must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man </s>
<s>  his worship
will be disengaged in half a minute </s>
<s>   now young gallows </s>
<s> 

this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he
unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell </s>
<s>   here he was
searched </s>
<s>  and nothing being found upon him locked up </s>
<s> 

this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not
so light </s>
<s>   it was most intolerably dirty </s>
<s>  for it was monday morning </s>
<s> 
and it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up
elsewhere since saturday night </s>
<s>   but this is little </s>
<s>   in our
stationhouses men and women are every night confined on the most
trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons compared with
which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried
found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces </s>
<s>  let any one who
doubts this compare the two </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated
in the lock </s>
<s>   he turned with a sigh to the book which had been the
innocent cause of all this disturbance </s>
<s> 

there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to
himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of
the book in a thoughtful manner </s>
<s>  something that touches and interests
me </s>
<s>   can he be innocent </s>
<s>   he looked likebye the bye exclaimed the
old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky
bless my soul </s>
<s> where have i seen something like that look before </s>
<s> 

after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same
meditative face into a back anteroom opening from the yard </s>
<s>  and there
retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye a vast
amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many
years </s>
<s>   no said the old gentleman shaking his head </s>
<s>  it must be
imagination </s>
<s> 

he wandered over them again </s>
<s>   he had called them into view and it was
not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them </s>
<s>   there
were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost
strangers peering intrusively from the crowd </s>
<s>  there were the faces of
young and blooming girls that were now old women </s>
<s>  there were faces that
the grave had changed and closed upon but which the mind superior to
its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling
back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming
of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond
the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be
set up as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
heaven </s>
<s> 

but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers
features bore a trace </s>
<s>   so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he
awakened </s>
<s>  and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman
buried them again in the pages of the musty book </s>
<s> 

he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man
with the keys to follow him into the office </s>
<s>   he closed his book
hastily </s>
<s>  and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the
renowned <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall </s>
<s>   <abvr> fang sat
behind a bar at the upper end </s>
<s>  and on one side the door was a sort of
wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited </s>
<s>  trembling
very much at the awfulness of the scene </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fang was a lean longbacked stiffnecked middlesized man with
no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and
sides of his head </s>
<s>   his face was stern and much flushed </s>
<s>   if he were
really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good
for him he might have brought action against his countenance for
libel and have recovered heavy damages </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman bowed respectfully </s>
<s>  and advancing to the magistrates
desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and
address sir </s>
<s>   he then withdrew a pace or two </s>
<s>  and with another
polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned </s>
<s> 

now it so happened that <abvr> fang was at that moment perusing a leading
article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent
decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth
time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state
for the home department </s>
<s>   he was out of temper </s>
<s>  and he looked up with
an angry scowl </s>
<s> 

who are you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card </s>
<s> 

officer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the
newspaper </s>
<s>   who is this fellow </s>
<s> 

my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentleman
my name sir is brownlow </s>
<s>   permit me to inquire the name of the
magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a
respectable person under the protection of the bench </s>
<s>   saying this
mr </s>
<s>  brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person
who would afford him the required information </s>
<s> 

officer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang throwing the paper on one side whats this
fellow charged with </s>
<s> 

hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer </s>
<s>  he
appears against this boy your worship </s>
<s> 

his worship knew this perfectly well </s>
<s>  but it was a good annoyance and
a safe one </s>
<s> 

appears against the boy does he </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang surveying <abvr>
brownlow contemptuously from head to foot </s>
<s>   swear him </s>
<s> 

before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 
and that is that i really never without actual experience could
have believed

hold your tongue sir </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang peremptorily </s>
<s> 

i will not sir </s>
<s>  replied the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the
office </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   youre an insolent impertinent fellow </s>
<s>   how
dare you bully a magistrate </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the old gentleman reddening </s>
<s> 

swear this person </s>
<s>  said fang to the clerk </s>
<s>   ill not hear another
word </s>
<s>   swear him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlows indignation was greatly roused </s>
<s>  but reflecting perhaps
that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it he suppressed
his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once </s>
<s> 

now said fang whats the charge against this boy </s>
<s>   what have you
got to say sir </s>
<s> 

i was standing at a bookstall <abvr> brownlow began </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue sir said <abvr> fang </s>
<s>   policeman </s>
<s>   wheres the
policeman </s>
<s>   here swear this policeman </s>
<s>   now policeman what is this </s>
<s> 

the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the
charge </s>
<s>  how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person </s>
<s> 
and how that was all he knew about it </s>
<s> 

are there any witnesses </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 

none your worship replied the policeman </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to the
prosecutor said in a towering passion </s>
<s> 

do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is man or
do you not </s>
<s>   you have been sworn </s>
<s>   now if you stand there refusing to
give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench </s>
<s>  i will
by

by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailor coughed
very loud just at the right moment </s>
<s>  and the former dropped a heavy
book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being
heardaccidently of course </s>
<s> 

with many interruptions and repeated insults <abvr> brownlow contrived
to state his case </s>
<s>   observing that in the surprise of the moment he
had run after the boy because he had saw him running away </s>
<s>  and
expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him
although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he
would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow </s>
<s> 

he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion </s>
<s>  and
i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bar i
really fear that he is ill </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i dare say </s>
<s>  said <abvr> fang with a sneer </s>
<s>   come none of
your tricks here you young vagabond </s>
<s>  they wont do </s>
<s>  whats your name </s>
<s> 

oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him </s>
<s>   he was deadly pale </s>
<s> 
and the whole place seemed turning round and round </s>
<s> 

whats your name you hardened scoundrel </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> fang </s>
<s> 
officer whats his name </s>
<s> 

this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who
was standing by the bar </s>
<s>   he bent over oliver and repeated the
inquiry </s>
<s>  but finding him really incapable of understanding the

he says his names tom white your worship said the kindhearted
thieftaker </s>

oh he wont speak out wont he </s>

where does he live </s>

where he can your worship replied the officer </s>

receive olivers answer </s>

has he any parents </s>

he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer </s>

hazarding the usual reply </s>

at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head </s>

round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
water </s>

stuff and nonsense </s>

how do you propose to deal with the case sir </s>

a low voice </s>

summarily replied <abvr> fang </s>

monthshard labour of course </s>

the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were

<s> 

the man was right </s>

growing rather too serious to be hushed up </s>
<s> 

swear the man growled <abvr> fang with a very ill grace </s>
<s>  now man
what have you got to say </s>
<s> 

this said the man </s>
<s>   i saw three boys </s>

here </s>
<s>   loitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman
was reading </s>
<s>   the robbery was committed by another boy </s>
<s>   i saw it done </s>
<s> 
and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it </s>
<s> 
having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy bookstall
keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact
circumstances of the robbery </s>
<s> 

why didnt you come here before </s>
<s>  said fang after a pause </s>
<s> 

i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man </s>
<s>   everybody who
could have helped me had joined in the pursuit </s>
<s>   i could get nobody
till five minutes ago </s>
<s>  and ive run here all the way </s>
<s> 

the prosecutor was reading was he </s>
<s>  inquired fang after another
pause </s>
<s> 

yes replied the man </s>
<s>   the very book he has in his hand </s>
<s> 

oh that book eh </s>
<s>  said fang </s>
<s>   is it paid for </s>
<s> 

no it is not replied the man with a smile </s>
<s> 

dear me i forgot all about it </s>
<s>  exclaimed the absent old gentleman
innocently </s>
<s> 

a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy </s>
<s>  said fang with
a comical effort to look humane </s>
<s>   i consider sir that you have
obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and
disreputable circumstances </s>
<s>  and you may think yourself very fortunate
that the owner of the property declines to prosecute </s>
<s>  let this be a
lesson to you my man or the law will overtake you yet </s>
<s>   the boy is
discharged </s>
<s>   clear the office </s>
<s> 

dn me </s>
<s>  cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had
kept down so long dn me </s>
<s>    ill

clear the office </s>
<s>  said the magistrate </s>
<s>   officers do you hear </s>
<s>  clear
the office </s>
<s> 

the mandate was obeyed </s>
<s>  and the indignant <abvr> brownlow was conveyed
out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other </s>
<s>   in a
perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance </s>
<s>   he reached the yard </s>
<s>  and his
passion vanished in a moment </s>
<s>   little oliver twist lay on his back on
the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with
water </s>
<s>  his face a deadly white </s>
<s>  and a cold tremble convulsing his whole
frame </s>
<s> 

poor boy poor boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow bending over him </s>
<s>  call a
coach somebody pray </s>
<s>   directly </s>
<s> 

a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on the
seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other </s>
<s> 

may i accompany you </s>
<s>  said the bookstall keeper looking in </s>
<s> 

bless me yes my dear sir said <abvr> brownlow quickly </s>
<s>   i forgot
you </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>   i have this unhappy book still </s>

<s>   poor
fellow </s>

the bookstall keeper got into the coach </s>

chapter xii

in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before </s>
<s>  and in
which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful
friends </s>
<s> 

the coach rattled away over nearly the same ground as that which
oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the
dodger </s>
<s>  and turning a different way when it reached the angel at
islington stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady
street near pentonville </s>
<s>   here a bed was prepared without loss of
time in which <abvr> brownlow saw his young charge carefully and
comfortably deposited </s>
<s>  and here he was tended with a kindness and
solicitude that knew no bounds </s>
<s> 

but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of
his new friends </s>
<s>   the sun rose and sank and rose and sank again and
many times after that </s>
<s>  and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy
bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever </s>
<s>   the
worm does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow
creeping fire upon the living frame </s>
<s> 

weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have
been a long and troubled dream </s>
<s>   feebly raising himself in the bed
with his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously around </s>
<s> 

what room is this </s>
<s>   where have i been brought to </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  this
is not the place i went to sleep in </s>
<s> 

he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak </s>
<s> 
but they were overheard at once </s>
<s>   the curtain at the beds head was
hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely
dressed rose as she undrew it from an armchair close by in which
she had been sitting at needlework </s>
<s> 

hush my dear said the old lady softly </s>
<s>   you must be very quiet or
you will be ill again </s>
<s>  and you have been very badas bad as bad could
be pretty nigh </s>
<s>   lie down again </s>
<s>  theres a dear </s>
<s>   with those words
the old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow </s>
<s>  and
smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving
in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand in
hers and drawing it round his neck </s>
<s> 

save us </s>
<s>  said the old lady with tears in her eyes </s>
<s>   what a grateful
little dear it is </s>
<s>   pretty creetur </s>
<s>   what would his mother feel if she
had sat by him as i have and could see him now </s>
<s> 

perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands
together </s>
<s>  perhaps she has sat by me </s>
<s>   i almost feel as if she had </s>
<s> 

that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly </s>
<s> 

i suppose it was replied oliver because heaven is a long way off </s>
<s> 
and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor
boy </s>
<s>   but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there </s>
<s> 
for she was very ill herself before she died </s>
<s>   she cant know anything
about me though added oliver after a moments silence </s>
<s>   if she had
seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful </s>
<s>  and her face has always
looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her </s>
<s> 

the old lady made no reply to this </s>
<s>  but wiping her eyes first and her
spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were
part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver
to drink </s>
<s>  and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very
quiet or he would be ill again </s>
<s> 

so oliver kept very still </s>
<s>  partly because he was anxious to obey the
kind old lady in all things </s>
<s>  and partly to tell the truth because he
was completely exhausted with what he had already said </s>
<s>   he soon fell
into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a
candle </s>
<s>   which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with
a very large and loudticking gold watch in his hand who felt his
pulse and said he was a great deal better </s>
<s> 

you are a great deal better are you not my dear </s>
<s>  said the
gentleman </s>
<s> 

yes thank you sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

yes  i know you are said the gentleman </s>
<s>   youre hungry too ant
you </s>
<s> 

no sir answered oliver </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said the gentleman </s>
<s>   no i know youre not </s>
<s>   he is not hungry
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin said the gentleman </s>
<s>   looking very wise </s>
<s> 

the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to
say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man </s>
<s>  the doctor
appeared much of the same opinion himself </s>
<s> 

you feel sleepy dont you my dear </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s> 

no sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look </s>
<s>  youre
not sleepy </s>
<s>   nor thirsty </s>
<s>   are you </s>
<s> 

yes sir rather thirsty answered oliver </s>
<s> 

just as i expected <abvr> bedwin said the doctor </s>
<s>   its very natural
that he should be thirsty </s>
<s>   you may give him a little tea maam and
some dry toast without any butter </s>
<s>   dont keep him too warm maam </s>
<s>  but
be careful that you dont let him be too cold </s>
<s>  will you have the
goodness </s>
<s> 

the old lady dropped a curtsey </s>
<s>   the doctor after tasting the cool
stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away </s>
<s>   his
boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went
downstairs </s>
<s> 

oliver dozed off again soon after this </s>
<s>  when he awoke it was nearly
twelve oclock </s>
<s>   the old lady tenderly bade him goodnight shortly
afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just
come </s>
<s>   bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer book and a
large nightcap </s>
<s>  putting the latter on her head and the former on the
table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up
with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series
of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings
forward and divers moans and chokings </s>
<s>  these however had no worse
effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep
again </s>
<s> 

and thus the night crept slowly on </s>
<s>   oliver lay awake for some time
counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
rushlightshade threw upon the ceiling </s>
<s>  or tracing with his languid
eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall </s>
<s>  the darkness and
the deep stillness of the room were very solemn </s>
<s>  as they brought into
the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many
days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his
awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently
prayed to heaven </s>
<s> 

gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
suffering alone imparts </s>
<s>  that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain
to wake from </s>
<s>   who if this were death would be roused again to all
the struggles and turmoils of life </s>
<s>  to all its cares for the present </s>
<s> 
its anxieties for the future </s>
<s>  more than all its weary recollections of
the past </s>
<s> 

it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes </s>
<s>  he felt
cheerful and happy </s>
<s>   the crisis of the disease was safely past </s>
<s>   he
belonged to the world again </s>
<s> 

in three days time he was able to sit in an easychair well propped
up with pillows </s>
<s>  and as he was still too weak to walk <abvr> bedwin had
him carried downstairs into the little housekeepers room which
belonged to her </s>
<s>   having him set here by the fireside the good old
lady sat herself down too </s>
<s>  and being in a state of considerable
delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most
violently </s>
<s> 

never mind me my dear said the old lady </s>
<s>  im only having a regular
good cry </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>  its all over now </s>
<s>  and im quite comfortable </s>
<s> 

youre very very kind to me maam said oliver </s>
<s> 

well never you mind that my dear said the old lady </s>
<s>  thats got
nothing to do with your broth </s>
<s>  and its full time you had it </s>
<s>  for the
doctor says <abvr> brownlow may come in to see you this morning </s>
<s>  and we
must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell
be pleased </s>
<s>   and with this the old lady applied herself to warming
up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth </s>
<s>   strong enough oliver
thought to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation
strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest
computation </s>
<s> 

are you fond of pictures dear </s>
<s>  inquired the old lady seeing that
oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung
against the wall </s>
<s>  just opposite his chair </s>
<s> 

i dont quite know maam said oliver without taking his eyes from
the canvas </s>
<s>  i have seen so few that i hardly know </s>
<s>   what a beautiful
mild face that ladys is </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than
they are or they wouldnt get any custom child </s>
<s>  the man that invented
the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
succeed </s>
<s>  its a deal too honest </s>
<s>   a deal said the old lady laughing
very heartily at her own acuteness </s>
<s> 

isis that a likeness maam </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s> 

yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth </s>
<s> 
thats a portrait </s>
<s> 

whose maam </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s> 

why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a
goodhumoured manner </s>
<s>   its not a likeness of anybody that you or i
know i expect </s>
<s>   it seems to strike your fancy dear </s>
<s> 

it is so pretty replied oliver </s>
<s> 

why sure youre not afraid of it </s>
<s>  said the old lady </s>
<s>  observing in
great surprise the look of awe with which the child regarded the
painting </s>
<s> 

oh no no returned oliver quickly </s>
<s>  but the eyes look so sorrowful </s>
<s> 
and where i sit they seem fixed upon me </s>
<s>   it makes my heart beat
added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak
to me but couldnt </s>
<s> 

lord save us </s>
<s>  exclaimed the old lady starting </s>
<s>  dont talk in that
way child </s>
<s>   youre weak and nervous after your illness </s>
<s>  let me wheel
your chair round to the other side </s>
<s>  and then you wont see it </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s> 
said the old lady suiting the action to the word </s>
<s>  you dont see it
now at all events </s>
<s> 

oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not
altered his position </s>
<s>  but he thought it better not to worry the kind
old lady </s>
<s>  so he smiled gently when she looked at him </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bedwin
satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of
toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
preparation </s>
<s>  oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition </s>
<s>   he
had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft rap at
the door </s>
<s>   come in said the old lady </s>
<s>  and in walked <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be </s>
<s>  but he had no
sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands
behind the skirts of his dressinggown to take a good long look at
oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
contortions </s>
<s>   oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and
made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his
benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again </s>
<s> 
and the fact is if the truth must be told that <abvr> brownlows heart
being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic
process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a
condition to explain </s>
<s> 

poor boy poor boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow clearing his throat </s>
<s>  im
rather hoarse this morning <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   im afraid i have caught
cold </s>
<s> 

i hope not sir said <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   everything you have had has
been well aired sir </s>
<s> 

i dont know bedwin </s>
<s>   i dont know said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  i rather
think i had a damp napkin at dinnertime yesterday </s>
<s>  but never mind
that </s>
<s>   how do you feel my dear </s>
<s> 

very happy sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   and very grateful indeed sir for
your goodness to me </s>
<s> 

good by said <abvr> brownlow stoutly </s>
<s>   have you given him any
nourishment bedwin </s>
<s>   any slops eh </s>
<s> 

he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied <abvr>
bedwin </s>
<s>   drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the
last word </s>
<s>   to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded
there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever </s>
<s> 

ugh </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow with a slight shudder </s>
<s>  a couple of glasses
of port wine would have done him a great deal more good </s>
<s>  wouldnt they
tom white eh </s>
<s> 

my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid </s>
<s>   with a look of
great astonishment </s>
<s> 

oliver said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  oliver what </s>
<s>   oliver white eh </s>
<s> 

no sir twist oliver twist </s>
<s> 

queer name </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   what made you tell the
magistrate your name was white </s>
<s> 

i never told him so sir returned oliver in amazement </s>
<s> 

this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in olivers face </s>
<s>   it was impossible to doubt him </s>
<s> 
there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments </s>
<s> 

some mistake said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   but although his motive for
looking steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the
resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him
so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze </s>
<s> 

i hope you are not angry with me sir </s>
<s>  said oliver raising his eyes
beseechingly </s>
<s> 

no no replied the old gentleman </s>
<s>   why </s>
<s>  whats this </s>
<s>   bedwin look
there </s>
<s> 

as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over olivers head and
then to the boys face </s>
<s>   there was its living copy </s>
<s>  the eyes the head
the mouth </s>
<s>  every feature was the same </s>
<s>  the expression was for the
instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with
startling accuracy </s>
<s> 

oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation </s>
<s>  for not being
strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away </s>
<s>   a
weakness on his part which affords the narrative an opportunity of
relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils
of the merry old gentleman </s>
<s>  and of recording

that when the dodger and his accomplished friend master bates joined
in the hueandcry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence
of their executing an illegal conveyance of <abvr> brownlows personal
property as has been already described they were actuated by a very
laudable and becoming regard for themselves </s>
<s>  and forasmuch as the
freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the
first and proudest boasts of a truehearted englishman so i need
hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt
them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great
a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own
preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code
of laws which certain profound and soundjudging philosophers have laid
down as the mainsprings of all natures deeds and actions </s>
<s>   the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to
matters of maxim and theory </s>
<s>   and by a very neat and pretty compliment
to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight
any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling </s>
<s>  for
these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by
universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and
weaknesses of her sex </s>
<s> 

if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of
the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate
predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a
foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when
the general attention was fixed upon oliver </s>
<s>  and making immediately for
their home by the shortest possible cut </s>
<s>   although i do not mean to
assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages
to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being
rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and
discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken men under the
pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge </s>
<s>  still i
do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable
practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories
to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every
possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect
themselves </s>
<s>   thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong </s>
<s>  and
you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify </s>
<s>  the
amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the
distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher
concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive
and impartial view of his own particular case </s>
<s> 

it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through
a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured
to halt beneath a low and dark archway </s>
<s>   having remained silent here
just long enough to recover breath to speak master bates uttered an
exclamation of amusement and delight </s>
<s>  and bursting into an
uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and
rolled thereon in a transport of mirth </s>

<s> 
do you want to be grabbed stupid </s>
<s> 

i cant help it said charley i cant help it </s>
<s>   to see him
splitting away at that pace and cutting round the corners and
knocking up again the posts and starting on again as if he was made
of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out
arter himoh my eye </s>
<s>  the vivid imagination of master bates presented
the scene before him in too strong colours </s>
<s>   as he arrived at this
apostrophe he again rolled upon the doorstep and laughed louder than
before </s>

<s>  taking advantage of the next
interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the
question </s>

what </s>

<s> 

ah what </s>
<s>  said the dodger </s>
<s> 

why what should he say </s>

in his merriment </s>

<s> 
and again said what do you mean </s>
<s> 

the dodger made no reply </s>
<s>  but putting his hat on again and gathering
the skirts of his longtailed coat under his arm thrust his tongue
into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some halfdozen times in
a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down
the court </s>
<s>   master bates followed with a thoughtful countenance </s>
<s> 

the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the
occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman as he
sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand </s>
<s>  a
pocketknife in his right </s>
<s>  and a pewter pot on the trivet </s>

rascally smile on his white face as he turned round and looking

door and listened </s>

the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his
violence </s>
<s>  and looked uneasily at each other </s>
<s>   but they made no reply </s>
<s> 

whats become of the boy </s>
<s>  said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by
the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations </s>
<s>   speak out
or ill throttle you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who
deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who
conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be
throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud
wellsustained and continuous roarsomething between a mad bull and a
speaking trumpet </s>
<s> 

will you speak </s>
<s>  thundered the jew </s>
<s>   shaking the dodger so much that
his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous </s>
<s> 

why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the
dodger sullenly </s>
<s>   come let go o me will you </s>
<s>   and swinging
himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the
jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass
at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat </s>
<s>  which if it had taken effect
would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily
replaced </s>
<s> 

the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude </s>
<s>  and
seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailants head </s>
<s>   but
charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full
at that young gentleman </s>
<s> 

why what the blazes is in the wind now </s>
<s>  growled a deep voice </s>
<s>  who
pitched that ere at me </s>
<s>   its well its the beer and not the pot as
hit me or id have settled somebody </s>
<s>   i might have knowd as nobody
but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to
throw away any drink but waterand not that unless he done the river
company every quarter </s>

neckhandkercher ant lined with beer </s>
<s>   come in you sneaking warmint </s>
<s> 
wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master </s>
<s> 
come in </s>
<s> 

the man who growled out these words was a stoutlybuilt fellow of
about fiveandthirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab
breeches laceup half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed
a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calves </s>
<s> the kind of legs
which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete
state without a set of fetters to garnish them </s>
<s>   he had a brown hat on
his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck </s>
<s>   with the
long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he
spoke </s>
<s>   he disclosed when he had done so a broad heavy countenance
with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes </s>
<s>  one of which
displayed various particoloured symptoms of having been recently
damaged by a blow </s>
<s> 

come in dye hear </s>
<s>  growled this engaging ruffian </s>
<s> 

a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty
different places skulked into the room </s>
<s> 

why didnt you come in afore </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s>   youre getting too
proud to own me afore company are you </s>
<s>   lie down </s>
<s> 

this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the
other end of the room </s>
<s>   he appeared well used to it however </s>
<s>  for he
coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound
and winking his very illlooking eyes twenty times in a minute
appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment </s>
<s> 

what are you up to </s>
<s>   illtreating the boys you covetous avaricious
insatiable old fence </s>
<s>  said the man seating himself deliberately </s>
<s> 
i wonder they dont murder you </s>
<s>   i would if i was them </s>
<s>   if id been
your prentice id have done it long ago andno i couldnt have
sold you afterwards for youre fit for nothing but keeping as a
curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow
glass bottles large enough </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s>  <abvr> sikes said the jew trembling </s>
<s>  dont speak so loud </s>
<s> 

none of your mistering replied the ruffian </s>
<s>  you always mean
mischief when you come that </s>
<s>   you know my name </s>
<s>   out with it </s>
<s>   i shant
disgrace it when the time comes </s>
<s> 

well well thenbill sikes said the jew with abject humility </s>
<s> 
you seem out of humour bill </s>
<s> 

perhaps i am replied sikes </s>
<s>  i should think you was rather out of
sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
about as you do when you blab and

are you mad </s>
<s>  said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and
pointing towards the boys </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left
ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder </s>
<s>  a piece of dumb
show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly </s>
<s>   he then in cant
terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled
but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here
demanded a glass of liquor </s>
<s> 

and mind you dont poison it said <abvr> sikes laying his hat upon the
table </s>
<s> 

this was said in jest </s>
<s>  but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard
he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish
at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far
from the old gentlemans merry heart </s>
<s> 

after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits <abvr> sikes
condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen </s>
<s>  which gracious
act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers
capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and
improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable
under the circumstances </s>
<s> 

im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get
us into trouble </s>
<s> 

thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin </s>
<s>  youre
blowed upon fagin </s>
<s> 

and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not
noticed the interruption </s>
<s>  and regarding the other closely as he did
soim afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with
a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than
it would for me my dear </s>
<s> 

the man started and turned round upon the jew </s>
<s>   but the old
gentlemans shoulders were shrugged up to his ears </s>
<s>  and his eyes were
vacantly staring on the opposite wall </s>
<s> 

there was a long pause </s>
<s>  every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his own reflections </s>
<s>  not excepting the dog who by
a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter
in the streets when he went out </s>
<s> 

somebody must find out wots been done at the office said <abvr> sikes
in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded assent </s>
<s> 

if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes
out again said <abvr> sikes and then he must be taken care on </s>
<s>   you
must get hold of him somehow </s>
<s> 

again the jew nodded </s>
<s> 

the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious </s>
<s>  but
unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being
adopted </s>
<s>   this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and
mr </s>
<s>  william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and
deeplyrooted antipathy to going near a policeoffice on any ground or
pretext whatever </s>
<s> 

how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to
guess </s>
<s>   it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject
however </s>
<s>  for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver
had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh </s>
<s> 

the very thing </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   bet will go </s>
<s>  wont you my dear </s>
<s> 

wheres </s>
<s>  inquired the young lady </s>
<s> 

only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxingly </s>
<s> 

it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm
that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and
earnest desire to be blessed if she would </s>
<s>  a polite and delicate
evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been
possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict
upon a fellowcreature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal </s>
<s> 

the jews countenance fell </s>
<s>   he turned from this young lady who was
gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and
yellow curlpapers to the other female </s>
<s> 

nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say </s>
<s> 

that it wont do </s>
<s>  so its no use atrying it on fagin replied nancy </s>
<s> 

what do you mean by that </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes looking up in a surly
manner </s>
<s> 

what i say bill replied the lady collectedly </s>
<s> 

why youre just the very person for it reasoned <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  nobody
about here knows anything of you </s>
<s> 

and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same
composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill </s>
<s> 

shell go fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 

no she wont fagin said nancy </s>
<s> 

yes she will fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> sikes was right </s>
<s>   by dint of alternate threats promises and
bribes the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
the commission </s>
<s>   she was not indeed withheld by the same
considerations as her agreeable friend </s>
<s>  for having recently removed
into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb
of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being
recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances </s>
<s> 

accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her
curlpapers tucked up under a straw bonnetboth articles of dress
being provided from the jews inexhaustible stockmiss nancy prepared
to issue forth on her errand </s>
<s> 

stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered
basket </s>
<s>   carry that in one hand </s>
<s>   it looks more respectable my dear </s>
<s> 

give her a doorkey to carry in her tother one fagin said sikes </s>
<s> 
it looks real and genivine like </s>
<s> 

yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large
streetdoor key on the forefinger of the young ladys right hand </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  very good </s>
<s>   very good indeed my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew rubbing
his hands </s>
<s> 

oh my brother </s>
<s>   my poor dear sweet innocent little brother </s>
<s> 
exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket
and the streetdoor key in an agony of distress </s>
<s>   what has become of
him </s>
<s>   where have they taken him to </s>
<s>   oh do have pity and tell me
whats been done with the dear boy gentlemen </s>
<s>  do gentlemen if you
please gentlemen </s>
<s> 

having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heartbroken tone </s>
<s> 
to the immeasurable delight of her hearers </s>
<s>   miss nancy paused winked
to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared </s>
<s> 

ah shes a clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his
young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition
to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld </s>
<s> 

shes a honour to her sex said <abvr> sikes filling his glass and
smiting the table with his enormous fist </s>
<s>   heres her health and
wishing they was all like her </s>
<s> 

while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the
accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the
policeoffice </s>
<s>  whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity
consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she
arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards </s>
<s> 

entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the
celldoors and listened </s>
<s>   there was no sound within </s>
<s>   so she coughed
and listened again </s>
<s>   still there was no reply </s>
<s>   so she spoke </s>
<s> 

nolly dear </s>
<s>  murmured nancy in a gentle voice </s>
<s>  nolly </s>
<s> 

there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been
taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society
having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by <abvr>
fang to the house of correction for one month </s>
<s>  with the appropriate and
amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be
more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical
instrument </s>
<s>   he made no answer </s>
<s>  being occupied mentally bewailing the
loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the
county </s>
<s>   so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  cried a faint and feeble voice </s>
<s> 

is there a little boy here </s>
<s>  inquired nancy with a preliminary sob </s>
<s> 

no replied the voice </s>
<s>  god forbid </s>
<s> 

this was a vagrant of sixtyfive who was going to prison for not
playing the flute </s>
<s>  or in other words for begging in the streets and
doing nothing for his livelihood </s>
<s>   in the next cell was another man
who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without
license </s>
<s>  thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the
stampoffice </s>
<s> 

but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or
knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in
the striped waistcoat </s>
<s>  and with the most piteous wailings and
lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of
the streetdoor key and the little basket demanded her own dear
brother </s>
<s> 

i havent got him my dear said the old man </s>
<s> 

where is he </s>
<s>  screamed nancy in a distracted manner </s>
<s> 

why the gentlemans got him replied the officer </s>
<s> 

what gentleman </s>
<s>   oh gracious heavens </s>
<s>   what gentleman </s>
<s>  exclaimed
nancy </s>
<s> 

in reply to this incoherent questioning the old man informed the
deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office
and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to
have been committed by another boy not in custody </s>
<s>  and that the
prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own
residence </s>
<s>   of and concerning which all the informant knew was that
it was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in
the directions to the coachman </s>
<s> 

in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman
staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a
swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could
think of to the domicile of the jew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered
than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat
expeditiously departed </s>
<s>   without devoting any time to the formality of
wishing the company goodmorning </s>
<s> 

we must know where he is my dears </s>
<s>  he must be found said the jew
greatly excited </s>
<s>   charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring
home some news of him </s>
<s>   nancy my dear i must have him found </s>
<s>   i trust
to you my dearto you and the artful for everything </s>
<s>   stay stay
added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand </s>
<s>  theres money
my dears </s>
<s>   i shall shut up this shop tonight </s>
<s>   youll know where to
find me </s>
<s>   dont stop here a minute </s>
<s>   not an instant my dears </s>
<s> 

with these words he pushed them from the room </s>
<s>   and carefully
doublelocking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of
concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver </s>
<s> 
then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
his clothing </s>
<s> 

a rap at the door startled him in this occupation </s>
<s>   whos there </s>
<s>  he
cried in a shrill tone </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  replied the voice of the dodger through the keyhole </s>
<s> 

what now </s>
<s>  cried the jew impatiently </s>
<s> 

is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says </s>
<s>  inquired the
dodger </s>
<s> 

yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him </s>
<s>   find him
find him out thats all </s>
<s>   i shall know what to do next </s>
<s>  never fear </s>
<s> 

the boy murmured a reply of intelligence </s>
<s>   and hurried downstairs after
his companions </s>
<s> 

he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation </s>
<s> 
if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his mouth
yet </s>

chapter xiv

comprising further particulars of olivers stay at <abvr> brownlows with
the remarkable prediction which one <abvr> grimwig uttered concerning him
when he went out on an errand

oliver soon recovering from the faintingfit into which <abvr> brownlows
abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was
carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and <abvr> bedwin in the
conversation that ensued </s>
<s>   which indeed bore no reference to olivers
history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse
without exciting him </s>
<s>   he was still too weak to get up to breakfast </s>
<s> 
but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first
act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again
looking on the face of the beautiful lady </s>
<s>   his expectations were
disappointed however for the picture had been removed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes </s>
<s> 
it is gone you see </s>
<s> 

i see it is maam replied oliver </s>
<s>   why have they taken it away </s>
<s> 

it has been taken down child because <abvr> brownlow said that as it
seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you
know rejoined the old lady </s>
<s> 

oh no indeed </s>
<s>   it didnt worry me maam said oliver </s>
<s>  i liked to
see it </s>
<s>   i quite loved it </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said the old lady goodhumouredly </s>
<s>  you get well as fast
as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>   i promise
you that </s>
<s>   now let us talk about something else </s>
<s> 

this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at
that time </s>
<s>   as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he
endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then </s>
<s>  so he listened
attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and
handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome
man and lived in the country </s>
<s>  and about a son who was clerk to a
merchant in the west indies </s>
<s>  and who was also such a good young man
and wrote such dutiful letters home four times ayear that it brought
the tears into her eyes to talk about them </s>
<s>   when the old lady had
expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children and the
merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone
poor dear soul </s>
<s>  just sixandtwenty years it was time to have tea </s>
<s> 
after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage </s>
<s>  which he learnt as
quickly as she could teach </s>
<s>   and at which game they played with great
interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some
warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and then to go cosily
to bed </s>
<s> 

they were happy days those of olivers recovery </s>
<s>   everything was so
quiet and neat and orderly </s>
<s>  everybody so kind and gentle </s>
<s>  that after
the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it
seemed like heaven itself </s>
<s>   he was no sooner strong enough to put his
clothes on properly than <abvr> brownlow caused a complete new suit and
a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him </s>
<s>   as oliver
was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave
them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell
them to a jew and keep the money for herself </s>
<s>   this she very readily
did </s>
<s>  and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew
roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think
that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger
of his ever being able to wear them again </s>
<s>   they were sad rags to tell
the truth </s>
<s>  and oliver had never had a new suit before </s>
<s> 

one evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was
sitting talking to <abvr> bedwin there came a message down from <abvr>
brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see
him in his study and talk to him a little while </s>
<s> 

bless us and save us </s>
<s>   wash your hands and let me part your hair
nicely for you child said <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>   dear heart alive </s>
<s>   if we
had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean
collar on and made you as smart as sixpence </s>
<s> 

oliver did as the old lady bade him </s>
<s>  and although she lamented
grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little
frill that bordered his shirtcollar </s>
<s>  he looked so delicate and
handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so
far as to say </s>
<s>   looking at him with great complacency from head to
foot that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the
longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better </s>
<s> 

thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door </s>
<s>   on <abvr> brownlow
calling to him to come in he found himself in a little back room
quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little
gardens </s>
<s>   there was a table drawn up before the window at which <abvr>
brownlow was seated reading </s>
<s>   when he saw oliver he pushed the book
away from him and told him to come near the table and sit down </s>
<s> 
oliver complied </s>
<s>  marvelling where the people could be found to read
such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
wiser </s>
<s>   which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver
twist every day of their lives </s>
<s> 

there are a good many books are there not my boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the
shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling </s>
<s> 

a great number sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   i never saw so many </s>
<s> 

you shall read them if you behave well said the old gentleman
kindly </s>
<s>  and you will like that better than looking at the
outsidesthat is some cases </s>
<s>  because there are books of which the
backs and covers are by far the best parts </s>
<s> 

i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to
some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding </s>
<s> 

not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head
and smiling as he did so </s>
<s>  there are other equally heavy ones though
of a much smaller size </s>
<s>   how should you like to grow up a clever man
and write books eh </s>
<s> 

i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  wouldnt you like to be a bookwriter </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s> 

oliver considered a little while </s>
<s>  and at last said he should think it
would be a much better thing to be a bookseller </s>
<s>  upon which the old
gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing </s>
<s> 
which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it
was </s>
<s> 

well well said the old gentleman composing his features </s>
<s>  dont be
afraid </s>
<s>   we wont make an author of you while theres an honest trade
to be learnt or brickmaking to turn to </s>
<s> 

thank you sir said oliver </s>
<s>   at the earnest manner of his reply the
old gentleman laughed again </s>
<s>  and said something about a curious
instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention
to </s>
<s> 

now said <abvr> brownlow speaking if possible in a kinder but at the
same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever known him
assume yet i want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am
going to say </s>
<s>   i shall talk to you without any reserve </s>
<s>  because i am
sure you are well able to understand me as many older persons would
be </s>
<s> 

oh dont tell you are going to send me away sir pray </s>
<s>  exclaimed
oliver alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentlemans
commencement </s>
<s>   dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
again </s>
<s>   let me stay here and be a servant </s>
<s>   dont send me back to the
wretched place i came from </s>
<s>   have mercy upon a poor boy sir </s>
<s> 

my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of
olivers sudden appeal </s>
<s>  you need not be afraid of my deserting you
unless you give me cause </s>
<s> 

i never never will sir interposed oliver </s>
<s> 

i hope not rejoined the old gentleman </s>
<s>   i do not think you ever
will </s>
<s>   i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have
endeavoured to benefit </s>
<s>  but i feel strongly disposed to trust you
nevertheless </s>
<s>  and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well
account for even to myself </s>
<s>   the persons on whom i have bestowed my
dearest love lie deep in their graves </s>
<s>  but although the happiness and
delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my
heart and sealed it up forever on my best affections </s>
<s>   deep
affliction has but strengthened and refined them </s>
<s> 

as the old gentleman said this in a low voice </s>
<s>   more to himself than to
his companion </s>
<s>   and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards </s>
<s> 
oliver sat quite still </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful
tone i only say this because you have a young heart </s>
<s>  and knowing
that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful
perhaps not to wound me again </s>
<s>   you say you are an orphan without a
friend in the world </s>
<s>  all the inquiries i have been able to make
confirm the statement </s>
<s>   let me hear your story </s>
<s>  where you come from </s>
<s> 
who brought you up </s>
<s>  and how you got into the company in which i found
you </s>
<s>   speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live </s>
<s> 

olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes </s>
<s>  when he was on
the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the
farm and carried to the workhouse by <abvr> bumble a peculiarly
impatient little doubleknock was heard at the streetdoor </s>
<s>   and the
servant running upstairs announced <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

is he coming up </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied the servant </s>
<s>   he asked if there were any muffins
in the house </s>
<s>  and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow smiled </s>
<s>  and turning to oliver said that <abvr> grimwig was
an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in
his manners </s>
<s>  for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason
to know </s>
<s> 

shall i go downstairs sir </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

no replied <abvr> brownlow i would rather you remained here </s>
<s> 

at this moment there walked into the room </s>
<s>   supporting himself by a
thick stick </s>
<s>   a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was
dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and
gaiters and a broadbrimmed white hat with the sides turned up with
green </s>
<s>   a very smallplaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat </s>
<s> 
and a very long steel watchchain with nothing but a key at the end
dangled loosely below it </s>
<s>   the ends of his white neckerchief were
twisted into a ball about the size of an orange </s>
<s>  the variety of shapes
into which his countenance was twisted defy description </s>
<s>   he had a
manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke </s>
<s>  and of looking
out of the corners of his eyes at the same time </s>
<s>   which irresistibly
reminded the beholder of a parrot </s>
<s>   in this attitude he fixed himself
the moment he made his appearance </s>
<s>  and holding out a small piece of
orangepeel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented
voice </s>
<s> 

look here </s>
<s>  do you see this </s>
<s>   isnt it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that i cant call at a mans house but i find a
piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase </s>
<s>  ive been lamed
with orangepeel once and i know orangepeel will be my death or ill
be content to eat my own head sir </s>
<s> 

this was the handsome offer with which <abvr> grimwig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he made </s>
<s>  and it was the more singular in his
case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility
of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed
mr </s>
<s>  grimwigs head was such a particularly large one that the most
sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question a very
thick coating of powder </s>
<s> 

ill eat my head sir repeated <abvr> grimwig striking his stick upon
the ground </s>
<s>   hallo </s>
<s>  whats that </s>
<s>  looking at oliver and retreating a
pace or two </s>
<s> 

this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said <abvr>
brownlow </s>
<s> 

oliver bowed </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to say thats the boy who had the fever i hope </s>
<s>  said
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig recoiling a little more </s>
<s>   wait a minute </s>
<s>  dont speak </s>
<s> 
stop continued <abvr> grimwig abruptly losing all dread of the fever
in his triumph at the discovery </s>
<s>  thats the boy who had the orange </s>
<s> 
if thats not the boy sir who had the orange and threw this bit of
peel upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too </s>
<s> 

no no he has not had one said <abvr> brownlow laughing </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>   put
down your hat </s>
<s>  and speak to my young friend </s>
<s> 

i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old
gentleman drawing off his gloves </s>
<s>   theres always more or less
orangepeel on the pavement in our street </s>
<s>  and i know its put there
by the surgeons boy at the corner </s>
<s>   a young woman stumbled over a bit
last night and fell against my gardenrailings </s>
<s>  directly she got up i
saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomimelight </s>
<s> 
dont go to him i called out of the window hes an assassin </s>
<s>   a
mantrap </s>
<s>   so he is </s>
<s>   if he is not  here the irascible old
gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick </s>
<s>  which was
always understood by his friends to imply the customary offer
whenever it was not expressed in words </s>
<s>  then still keeping his stick
in his hand he sat down </s>
<s>  and opening a double eyeglass which he
wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of oliver </s>
<s>   who
seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again </s>
<s> 

thats the boy is it </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig at length </s>
<s> 

thats the boy replied <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

how are you boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

a great deal better thank you sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about
to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step downstairs and tell
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin they were ready for tea </s>
<s>  which as he did not half like the
visitors manner he was very happy to do </s>
<s> 

he is a nicelooking boy is he not </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

i dont know replied <abvr> grimwig pettishly </s>
<s> 

dont know </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   i dont know </s>
<s>   i never see any difference in boys </s>
<s>   i only knew
two sort of boys </s>
<s>   mealy boys and beeffaced boys </s>
<s> 

and which is oliver </s>
<s> 

mealy </s>
<s>   i know a friend who has a beeffaced boy </s>
<s>  a fine boy they
call him </s>
<s>  with a round head and red cheeks and glaring eyes </s>
<s>  a horrid
boy </s>
<s>  with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams
of his blue clothes </s>
<s>  with the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a
wolf </s>
<s>   i know him </s>
<s>   the wretch </s>
<s> 

come said <abvr> brownlow these are not the characteristics of young
oliver twist </s>
<s>  so he neednt excite your wrath </s>
<s> 

they are not replied <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   he may have worse </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> brownlow coughed impatiently </s>
<s>  which appeared to afford <abvr>
grimwig the most exquisite delight </s>
<s> 

he may have worse i say repeated <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   where does he come
from </s>
<s>   who is he </s>
<s>   what is he </s>
<s>   he has had a fever </s>
<s>   what of that </s>
<s> 
fevers are not peculiar to good people </s>
<s>  are they </s>
<s>   bad people have
fevers sometimes </s>
<s>  havent they eh </s>
<s>   i knew a man who was hung in
jamaica for murdering his master </s>
<s>   he had had a fever six times </s>
<s>  he
wasnt recommended to mercy on that account </s>
<s>   pooh </s>
<s>  nonsense </s>
<s> 

now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own heart <abvr>
grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and
manner were unusually prepossessing </s>
<s>  but he had a strong appetite for
contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
orangepeel </s>
<s>  and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to
him whether a boy was welllooking or not he had resolved from the
first to oppose his friend </s>
<s>   when <abvr> brownlow admitted that on no one
point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer </s>
<s>  and that he
had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he
thought the boy was strong enough to hear it </s>
<s>  <abvr> grimwig chuckled
maliciously </s>
<s>   and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper
was in the habit of counting the plate at night </s>
<s>  because if she didnt
find a tablespoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would
be content toand so forth </s>
<s> 

all this <abvr> brownlow although himself somewhat of an impetuous
gentleman </s>
<s>   knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good
humour </s>
<s>  as <abvr> grimwig at tea was graciously pleased to express his
entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly </s>
<s>  and
oliver who made one of the party began to feel more at his ease than
he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence </s>
<s> 

and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of
the life and adventures of oliver twist </s>
<s>  asked grimwig of <abvr>
brownlow at the conclusion of the meal </s>
<s>  looking sideways at oliver as
he resumed his subject </s>
<s> 

tomorrow morning replied <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   i would rather he was
alone with me at the time </s>
<s>   come up to me tomorrow morning at ten
oclock my dear </s>
<s> 

yes sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   he answered with some hesitation because
he was confused by <abvr> grimwigs looking so hard at him </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  he
wont come up to you tomorrow morning </s>
<s>   i saw him hesitate </s>
<s>  he is
deceiving you my good friend </s>
<s> 

ill swear he is not replied <abvr> brownlow warmly </s>
<s> 

if he is not said <abvr> grimwig ill and down went the stick </s>
<s> 

ill answer for that boys truth with my life </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow
knocking the table </s>
<s> 

and i for his falsehood with my head </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> grimwig knocking
the table also </s>
<s> 

we shall see said <abvr> brownlow checking his rising anger </s>
<s> 

we will replied <abvr> grimwig with a provoking smile </s>
<s>   we will </s>
<s> 

as fate would have it <abvr> bedwin chanced to bring in at this moment
a small parcel of books which <abvr> brownlow had that morning purchased
of the identical bookstallkeeper who has already figured in this
history </s>
<s>  having laid them on the table she prepared to leave the room </s>
<s> 

stop the boy <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  there is something to
go back </s>
<s> 

he has gone sir replied <abvr> bedwin </s>
<s> 

call after him said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  its particular </s>
<s>   he is a poor
man and they are not paid for </s>
<s>   there are some books to be taken back
too </s>
<s> 

the streetdoor was opened </s>
<s>   oliver ran one way </s>
<s>  and the girl ran
another </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy </s>
<s> 
but there was no boy in sight </s>
<s>   oliver and the girl returned in a
breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him </s>
<s> 

dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  i
particularly wished those books to be returned tonight </s>
<s> 

send oliver with them said <abvr> grimwig with an ironical smile </s>
<s>  he
will be sure to deliver them safely you know </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  do let me take them if you please sir said oliver </s>
<s>  ill run
all the way sir </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out
on any account </s>
<s>  when a most malicious cough from <abvr> grimwig determined
him that he should </s>
<s>  and that by his prompt discharge of the
commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions </s>
<s>   on
this head at least </s>
<s>   at once </s>
<s> 

you shall go my dear said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   the books are on a
chair by my table </s>
<s>   fetch them down </s>
<s> 

oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his arm in
a great bustle </s>
<s>  and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to
take </s>
<s> 

you are to say said <abvr> brownlow glancing steadily at grimwig </s>
<s>  you
are to say that you have brought those books back </s>
<s>  and that you have
come to pay the four pound ten i owe him </s>
<s>   this is a fivepound note
so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change </s>
<s> 

i wont be ten minutes sir said oliver eagerly </s>
<s>   having buttoned
up the banknote in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully
under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room </s>
<s>   <abvr>
bedwin followed him to the streetdoor giving him many directions
about the nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of
the street </s>
<s>   all of which oliver said he clearly understood </s>
<s>   having
superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old lady
at length permitted him to depart </s>
<s> 

bless his sweet face </s>
<s>  said the old lady looking after him </s>
<s>  i cant
bear somehow to let him go out of my sight </s>
<s> 

at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned
the corner </s>
<s>   the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and
closing the door went back to her own room </s>
<s> 

let me see </s>
<s>  hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said <abvr>
brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table </s>
<s>   it will
be dark by that time </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you really expect him to come back do you </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

dont you </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> brownlow smiling </s>
<s> 

the spirit of contradiction was strong in <abvr> grimwigs breast at the
moment </s>
<s>  and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile </s>
<s> 

no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not </s>
<s>  the boy has
a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his
arm and a fivepound note in his pocket </s>
<s>   hell join his old friends
the thieves and laugh at you </s>
<s>   if ever that boy returns to this house
sir ill eat my head </s>
<s> 

with these words he drew his chair closer to the table </s>
<s>  and there the
two friends sat in silent expectation with the watch between them </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our
own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
hasty conclusions that although <abvr> grimwig was not by any means a
badhearted man and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly
and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come back </s>
<s> 

it grew so dark that the figures on the dialplate were scarcely
discernible </s>
<s>  but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in
silence with the watch between them </s>

chapter xv

showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy
were

in the obscure parlour of a low publichouse in the filthiest part of
little saffron hill </s>
<s>  a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight
burnt all day in the wintertime </s>
<s>  and where no ray of sun ever shone in
the summer </s>
<s>   there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a
small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a man in a
velveteen coat drab shorts halfboots and stockings whom even by
that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated
to recognise as <abvr> william sikes </s>
<s>   at his feet sat a whitecoated
redeyed dog </s>
<s>  who occupied himself alternately in winking at his
master with both eyes at the same time </s>
<s>  and in licking a large fresh
cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some
recent conflict </s>
<s> 

keep quiet you warmint </s>
<s>   keep quiet </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes suddenly
breaking silence </s>
<s>   whether his meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought
upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable
from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is matter for
argument and consideration </s>
<s>   whatever was the cause the effect was a
kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously </s>
<s> 

dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
their masters </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sikess dog having faults of temper in common
with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a
powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth
in one of the halfboots </s>
<s>   having given in a hearty shake he retired
growling under a form </s>
<s>  just escaping the pewter measure which <abvr>
sikes levelled at his head </s>
<s> 

you would would you </s>
<s>  said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and
deliberately opening with the other a large claspknife which he drew
from his pocket </s>
<s>   come here you born devil </s>
<s>   come here </s>
<s>   dye hear </s>
<s> 

the dog no doubt heard </s>
<s>  because <abvr> sikes spoke in the very harshest
key of a very harsh voice </s>
<s>  but appearing to entertain some
unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he
was and growled more fiercely than before </s>
<s>   at the same time grasping
the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild
beast </s>
<s> 

this resistance only infuriated <abvr> sikes the more </s>
<s>  who dropping on
his knees began to assail the animal most furiously </s>
<s>   the dog jumped
from right to left and from left to right </s>
<s>  snapping growling and
barking </s>
<s>  the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed </s>
<s>  and the
struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other </s>
<s>  when the
door suddenly opening the dog darted out </s>
<s>   leaving bill sikes with the
poker and the claspknife in his hands </s>
<s> 

there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage </s>
<s>   <abvr>
sikes being disappointed of the dogs participation at once
transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer </s>
<s> 

what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for </s>
<s>  said sikes
with a fierce gesture </s>
<s> 

i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humbly </s>
<s>  for the
jew was the new comer </s>
<s> 

didnt know you whitelivered thief </s>
<s>  growled sikes </s>
<s>  couldnt you
hear the noise </s>
<s> 

not a sound of it as im a living man bill replied the jew </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>   you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce
sneer </s>
<s>   sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go </s>
<s>   i
wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with a forced smile </s>
<s> 

cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as
havent half the pluck of curs lets a man kill a dog how he likes
replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look </s>
<s> 
thats why </s>
<s> 

the jew rubbed his hands </s>
<s>  and sitting down at the table affected to
laugh at the pleasantry of his friend </s>
<s>   he was obviously very ill at
ease however </s>
<s> 

grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with
savage contempt </s>
<s>  grin away </s>
<s>   youll never have the laugh at me
though unless its behind a nightcap </s>
<s>   ive got the upper hand over
you fagin </s>
<s>  and dme ill keep it </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>   if i go you go </s>
<s>  so take
care of me </s>
<s> 

well well my dear said the jew i know all that </s>
<s>  wewehave a
mutual interest billa mutual interest </s>
<s> 

humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
the jews side than on his </s>
<s>   well what have you got to say to me </s>
<s> 

its all passed safe through the meltingpot replied fagin and
this is your share </s>
<s>   its rather more than it ought to be my dear </s>
<s>  but
as i know youll do me a good turn another time and

stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently </s>
<s>  where is it </s>
<s> 
hand over </s>
<s> 

yes yes bill </s>
<s>  give me time give me time replied the jew
soothingly </s>
<s>   here it is </s>
<s>   all safe </s>
<s>   as he spoke he drew forth an
old cotton handkerchief from his breast </s>
<s>  and untying a large knot in
one corner produced a small brownpaper packet </s>
<s>   sikes snatching it
from him hastily opened it </s>
<s>  and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
contained </s>
<s> 

this is all is it </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

all replied the jew </s>
<s> 

you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along have you </s>
<s>  inquired sikes suspiciously </s>
<s>  dont put on an
injured look at the question </s>
<s>  youve done it many a time </s>
<s>  jerk the
tinkler </s>
<s> 

these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell </s>
<s> 
it was answered by another jew </s>
<s>   younger than fagin but nearly as vile
and repulsive in appearance </s>
<s> 

bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure </s>
<s>   the jew perfectly
understanding the hint retired to fill it </s>
<s>   previously exchanging a
remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if
in expectation of it and shook his head in reply </s>
<s>  so slightly that the
action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
person </s>
<s>   it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie
the bootlace which the dog had torn </s>
<s>   possibly if he had observed the
brief interchange of signals he might have thought that it boded no
good to him </s>
<s> 

is anybody here barney </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s>  speaking now that that
sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground </s>
<s> 

dot a shoul replied barney </s>
<s>  whose words </s>
<s>   whether they came from the
heart or not </s>
<s>   made their way through the nose </s>
<s> 

nobody </s>
<s>  inquired fagin in a tone of surprise </s>
<s>   which perhaps might
mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth </s>
<s> 

dobody but biss dadsy replied barney </s>
<s> 

nancy </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes </s>
<s>   where </s>
<s>   strike me blind if i dont honour
that ere girl for her native talents </s>
<s> 

shes bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney </s>
<s> 

send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor </s>
<s>  send her
here </s>
<s> 

barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission </s>
<s>  the jew remaining
silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired </s>
<s>  and
presently returned ushering in nancy </s>
<s>  who was decorated with the
bonnet apron basket and streetdoor key complete </s>
<s> 

you are on the scent are you nancy </s>
<s>  inquired sikes proffering the
glass </s>
<s> 

yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents </s>
<s> 
and tired enough of it i am too </s>
<s>   the young brats been ill and
confined to the crib </s>
<s>  and

ah nancy dear </s>
<s>  said fagin looking up </s>
<s> 

now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eyebrows and a
half closing of his deeplyset eyes warned miss nancy that she was
disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance </s>
<s> 
the fact is all we need care for here </s>
<s>  and the fact is that she
suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon <abvr>
sikes turned the conversation to other matters </s>
<s>  in about ten minutes
time <abvr> fagin was seized with a fit of coughing </s>
<s>  upon which nancy
pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself
expressed his intention of accompanying her </s>
<s>  they went away together
followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a backyard
as soon as his master was out of sight </s>
<s> 

the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it </s>
<s> 
looked after him as he walked up the dark passage </s>
<s>  shook his clenched
fist </s>
<s>  muttered a deep curse </s>
<s>  and then with a horrible grin reseated
himself at the table </s>
<s>  where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the hueandcry </s>
<s> 

meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very
short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the
bookstall </s>
<s>   when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a
bystreet which was not exactly in his way </s>
<s>  but not discovering his
mistake until he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in
the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back </s>
<s>  and
so marched on as quickly as he could with the books under his arm </s>
<s> 

he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to
feel </s>
<s>  and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick
who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment </s>
<s> 
when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud </s>
<s>   oh my
dear brother </s>
<s>   and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter
was when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round
his neck </s>
<s> 

dont cried oliver struggling </s>
<s>   let go of me </s>
<s>   who is it </s>
<s>  what are
you stopping me for </s>
<s> 

the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from
the young woman who had embraced him </s>
<s>  and who had a little basket and a
streetdoor key in her hand </s>
<s> 

oh my gracious </s>
<s>  said the young woman i have found him </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  oliver </s>
<s> 
oliver </s>
<s>   oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your
account </s>
<s>   come home dear come </s>
<s>   oh ive found him </s>
<s>   thank gracious
goodness heavins ive found him </s>
<s>   with these incoherent exclamations
the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully
hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was
also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the
doctor </s>
<s>   to which the butchers boy </s>
<s>   who appeared of a lounging not
to say indolent disposition </s>
<s>   replied that he thought not </s>
<s> 

oh no no never mind said the young woman grasping olivers hand </s>
<s> 
im better now </s>
<s>   come home directly you cruel boy </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

oh maam replied the young woman he ran away near a month ago
from his parents who are hardworking and respectable people </s>
<s>  and went
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters </s>
<s>  and almost broke his
mothers heart </s>
<s> 

young wretch </s>

time </s>

moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was
forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to
give utterance to unintelligible </s>
<s>   it was of little moment indeed
whether they were intelligible or no </s>

the gaslamps were lighted </s>
<s>  <abvr> bedwin was waiting anxiously at the
open door </s>

chapter xvi

relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy

the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open
space </s>
<s>  scattered about which were pens for beasts and other
indications of a cattlemarket </s>
<s>   sikes slackened his pace when they
reached this spot </s>
<s>   the girl being quite unable to support any longer
the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked </s>
<s>   turning to oliver
he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancys hand </s>
<s> 

do you hear </s>
<s>  growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round </s>
<s> 

they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers </s>
<s> 

oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail </s>
<s>   he
held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers </s>
<s> 

give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand </s>
<s> 
here bullseye </s>
<s> 

the dog looked up and growled </s>
<s> 

see here boy </s>
<s>  said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat </s>
<s> 
if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him </s>
<s>   dye mind </s>
<s> 

the dog growled again </s>
<s>  and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were
anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay </s>
<s> 

hes as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt </s>
<s>  said
sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval </s>
<s> 
now you know what youve got to expect master so call away as quick
as you like </s>
<s>  the dog will soon stop that game </s>
<s>   get on youngun </s>
<s> 

bullseye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
endearing form of speech </s>
<s>  and giving vent to another admonitory growl
for the benefit of oliver led the way onward </s>
<s> 

it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been
grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary </s>
<s>  the night
was dark and foggy </s>
<s>   the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle
through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the
streets and houses in gloom </s>
<s>  rendering the strange place still stranger
in olivers eyes </s>
<s>  and making his uncertainty the more dismal and
depressing </s>
<s> 

they had hurried on a few paces when a deep churchbell struck the
hour </s>
<s>   with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned
their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded </s>
<s> 

eight o clock bill said nancy when the bell ceased </s>
<s> 

whats the good of telling me that </s>
<s>  i can hear it cant i </s>
<s>  replied
sikes </s>
<s> 

i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy </s>
<s> 

of course they can replied sikes </s>
<s>   it was bartlemy time when i was
shopped </s>
<s>  and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt
hear the squeaking on </s>
<s>   arter i was locked up for the night the row
and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could
almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said nancy who still had her face turned towards the
quarter in which the bell had sounded </s>
<s>   oh bill such fine young
chaps as them </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  thats all you women think of answered sikes </s>
<s>   fine young
chaps </s>
<s>   well theyre as good as dead so it dont much matter </s>
<s> 

with this consolation <abvr> sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency
to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step
out again </s>
<s> 

wait a minute </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   i wouldnt hurry by if it was you
that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck
bill </s>
<s>   id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow
was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me </s>
<s> 

and what good would that do </s>
<s>  inquired the unsentimental <abvr> sikes </s>
<s> 
unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at
all for all the good it would do me </s>
<s>   come on and dont stand
preaching there </s>
<s> 

the girl burst into a laugh </s>
<s>  drew her shawl more closely round her </s>
<s>  and
they walked away </s>
<s>   but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in
her face as they passed a gaslamp saw that it had turned a deadly
white </s>
<s> 

they walked on by littlefrequented and dirty ways for a full
halfhour </s>
<s>   meeting very few people and those appearing from their
looks to hold much the same position in society as <abvr> sikes himself </s>
<s> 
at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of
oldclothes shops </s>
<s>  the dog running forward as if conscious that there
was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the
door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted </s>
<s>  the house was
in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed a board intimating
that it was to let </s>
<s>   which looked as if it had hung there for many
years </s>
<s> 

all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about </s>
<s> 

nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell </s>
<s> 
they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few
moments under a lamp </s>
<s>   a noise as if a sash window were gently raised
was heard </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards the door softly opened </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes then
seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony </s>
<s>  and
all three were quickly inside the house </s>
<s> 

the passage was perfectly dark </s>
<s>   they waited while the person who had
let them in chained and barred the door </s>
<s> 

anybody here </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

no replied a voice which oliver thought he had heard before </s>
<s> 

is the old un here </s>
<s>  asked the robber </s>
<s> 

yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been </s>
<s> 
wont he be glad to see you </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s> 

the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it
seemed familiar to olivers ears </s>
<s>   but it was impossible to distinguish
even the form of the speaker in the darkness </s>
<s> 

lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or
treading on the dog </s>
<s>   look after your legs if you do </s>
<s> 

stand still a moment and ill get you one replied the voice </s>
<s>  the
receding footsteps of the speaker were heard </s>
<s>  and in another minute
the form of <abvr> john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared </s>
<s> 
he bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
stick </s>
<s> 

the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin </s>
<s>  but turning away
beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs </s>
<s>  they
crossed an empty kitchen </s>
<s>  and opening the door of a low
earthysmelling room which seemed to have been built in a small
backyard were received with a shout of laughter </s>
<s> 

oh my wig my wig </s>
<s>  cried master charles bates from whose lungs the
laughter had proceeded </s>
<s>   here he is </s>
<s>  oh cry here he is </s>
<s>   oh fagin
look at him </s>
<s>   fagin do look at him </s>
<s>  i cant bear it </s>
<s>  it is such a
jolly game i cant bear it </s>
<s>   hold me somebody while i laugh it out </s>
<s> 

with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth master bates laid himself
flat on the floor </s>
<s>  and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an
ectasy of facetious joy </s>
<s>   then jumping to his feet he snatched the
cleft stick from the dodger </s>
<s>  and advancing to oliver viewed him round
and round </s>
<s>  while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number
of low bows to the bewildered boy </s>
<s>   the artful meantime who was of a
rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it
interfered with business rifled olivers pockets with steady assiduity </s>
<s> 

look at his togs fagin </s>
<s>  said charley putting the light so close to
his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire </s>
<s>   look at his togs </s>
<s> 
superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut </s>
<s>   oh my eye what a game </s>
<s> 
and his books too </s>
<s>   nothing but a gentleman fagin </s>
<s> 

delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing
with mock humility </s>
<s>   the artful shall give you another suit my dear
for fear you should spoil that sunday one </s>
<s>   why didnt you write my
dear and say you were coming </s>
<s>   wed have got something warm for
supper </s>
<s> 

at his master bates roared again </s>
<s>  so loud that fagin himself relaxed
and even the dodger smiled </s>
<s>  but as the artful drew forth the fivepound
note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
awakened his merriment </s>
<s> 

hallo whats that </s>
<s>  inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew
seized the note </s>
<s>   thats mine fagin </s>
<s> 

no no my dear said the jew </s>
<s>   mine bill mine </s>
<s>   you shall have
the books </s>
<s> 

if that aint mine </s>
<s>  said bill sikes putting on his hat with a
determined air </s>
<s>  mine and nancys that is </s>
<s>  ill take the boy back
again </s>
<s> 

the jew started </s>
<s>   oliver started too though from a very different
cause </s>
<s>  for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being
taken back </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>   hand over will you </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s> 

this is hardly fair bill </s>
<s>  hardly fair is it nancy </s>
<s>  inquired the
jew </s>
<s> 

fair or not fair retorted sikes hand over i tell you </s>
<s>  do you
think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time
but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as
gets grabbed through you </s>
<s>   give it here you avaricious old skeleton
give it here </s>
<s> 

with this gentle remonstrance <abvr> sikes plucked the note from between
the jews finger and thumb </s>
<s>  and looking the old man coolly in the face
folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief </s>
<s> 

thats for our share of the trouble said sikes </s>
<s>  and not half
enough neither </s>
<s>   you may keep the books if youre fond of reading </s>
<s> 
if you aint sell em </s>
<s> 

theyre very pretty said charley bates </s>
<s>  who with sundry grimaces
had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question </s>
<s>  beautiful
writing isnt is oliver </s>
<s>   at sight of the dismayed look with which
oliver regarded his tormentors master bates who was blessed with a
lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ectasy more
boisterous than the first </s>
<s> 

they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his hands </s>
<s> 
to the good kind old gentleman who took me into his house and had
me nursed when i was near dying of the fever </s>
<s>  oh pray send them back </s>
<s> 
send him back the books and money </s>
<s>   keep me here all my life long </s>
<s>  but
pray pray send them back </s>
<s>   hell think i stole them </s>
<s>  the old lady </s>
<s> 
all of them who were so kind to me </s>
<s>  will think i stole them </s>
<s>   oh do
have mercy upon me and send them back </s>
<s> 

with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet </s>
<s>  and beat his hands
together in perfect desperation </s>
<s> 

the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting
his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot </s>
<s>   youre right oliver youre
right </s>
<s>  they will think you have stolen em </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  chuckled the jew
rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen
our time </s>
<s> 

of course it couldnt replied sikes </s>
<s>  i knowd that directly i see
him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm </s>
<s>   its all
right enough </s>
<s>   theyre softhearted psalmsingers or they wouldnt
have taken him in at all </s>
<s>  and theyll ask no questions after him fear
they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged </s>
<s>   hes safe
enough </s>
<s> 

oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being
spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what
passed </s>
<s>  but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet
and tore wildly from the room </s>
<s>   uttering shrieks for help which made
the bare old house echo to the roof </s>
<s> 

keep back the dog bill </s>
<s>  cried nancy springing before the door and
closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit </s>
<s>   keep
back the dog </s>
<s>  hell tear the boy to pieces </s>
<s> 

serve him right </s>
<s>  cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from
the girls grasp </s>
<s>   stand off from me or ill split your head against
the wall </s>
<s> 

i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the
girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first </s>
<s> 

shant he </s>
<s>  said sikes setting his teeth </s>
<s>   ill soon do that if you
dont keep off </s>
<s> 

the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the
room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among
them </s>
<s> 

whats the matter here </s>
<s>  said fagin looking round </s>
<s> 

the girls gone mad i think replied sikes savagely </s>
<s> 

no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle </s>
<s> 
no she hasnt fagin </s>
<s>  dont think it </s>
<s> 

then keep quiet will you </s>
<s>  said the jew with a threatening look </s>
<s> 

no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud </s>
<s> 
come </s>
<s>   what do you think of that </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel
tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
conversation with her at present </s>
<s>   with the view of diverting the
attention of the company he turned to oliver </s>
<s> 

so you wanted to get away my dear did you </s>
<s>  said the jew taking up
a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

oliver made no reply </s>
<s>   but he watched the jews motions and breathed
quickly </s>
<s> 

wanted to get assistance </s>
<s>  called for the police </s>
<s>  did you </s>
<s>  sneered the
jew catching the boy by the arm </s>
<s>   well cure you of that my young
master </s>
<s> 

the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club </s>
<s>  and
was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it
from his hand </s>
<s>   she flung it into the fire with a force that brought
some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room </s>
<s> 

i wont stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl </s>
<s>  youve got
the boy and what more would you have </s>
<s> let him belet him beor i
shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows
before my time </s>
<s> 

the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this
threat </s>
<s>  and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked
alternately at the jew and the other robber </s>
<s>  her face quite colourless
from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself </s>
<s> 

why nancy </s>
<s>  said the jew in a soothing tone </s>
<s>  after a pause during
which he and <abvr> sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
manner </s>
<s>  youyoure more clever than ever tonight </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  my dear
you are acting beautifully </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>   take care i dont overdo it </s>
<s>   you will be the
worse for it fagin if i do </s>
<s>  and so i tell you in good time to keep
clear of me </s>
<s> 

there is something about a roused woman </s>
<s>  especially if she add to all
her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and
despair </s>
<s>  which few men like to provoke </s>
<s>  the jew saw that it would be
hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss
nancys rage </s>
<s>  and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a
glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes </s>
<s>  as if to hint that
he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes thus mutely appealed to </s>
<s>  and possibly feeling his personal
pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy
to reason </s>
<s>  gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and
threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the
fertility of his invention </s>
<s>  as they produced no visible effect on the
object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more
tangible arguments </s>
<s> 

what do you mean by this </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>  backing the inquiry with a very
common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features </s>
<s> 
which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand
times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a
disorder as measles </s>
<s>  what do you mean by it </s>
<s>   burn my body </s>
<s>   do you
know who you are and what you are </s>
<s> 

oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing
hysterically </s>
<s>  and shaking her head from side to side with a poor
assumption of indifference </s>
<s> 

well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was
accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a
good long time to come </s>
<s> 

the girl laughed again </s>
<s>  even less composedly than before </s>
<s>  and darting
a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the
blood came </s>
<s> 

youre a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a
contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side </s>
<s>   a pretty
subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of </s>
<s> 

god almighty help me i am </s>
<s>  cried the girl passionately </s>
<s>  and i wish
i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them
we passed so near tonight before i had lent a hand in bringing him
here </s>
<s>   hes a thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night
forth </s>
<s>   isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows </s>
<s> 

come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory
tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all
that passed </s>
<s>  we must have civil words </s>
<s>  civil words bill </s>
<s> 

civil words </s>
<s>  cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see </s>
<s> 
civil words you villain </s>
<s>   yes you deserve em from me </s>
<s>  i thieved for
you when i was a child not half as old as this </s>
<s>  pointing to oliver </s>
<s> 
i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve
years since </s>
<s>   dont you know it </s>
<s>   speak out </s>
<s>   dont you know it </s>
<s> 

well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification </s>
<s>  and
if you have its your living </s>
<s> 

aye it is </s>
<s>  returned the girl </s>
<s>  not speaking but pouring out the
words in one continuous and vehement scream </s>
<s>   it is my living </s>
<s>  and the
cold wet dirty streets are my home </s>
<s>  and youre the wretch that drove
me to them long ago and thatll keep me there day and night day and
night till i die </s>
<s> 

i shall do you a mischief </s>
<s>  interposed the jew goaded by these
reproaches </s>
<s>  a mischief worse than that if you say much more </s>
<s> 

the girl said nothing more </s>
<s>  but tearing her hair and dress in a
transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably
have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been
seized by sikes at the right moment </s>
<s>  upon which she made a few
ineffectual struggles and fainted </s>
<s> 

shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner </s>
<s>  shes
uncommon strong in the arms when shes up in this way </s>
<s> 

the jew wiped his forehead </s>
<s>  and smiled as if it were a relief to have
the disturbance over </s>
<s>  but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the
boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
incidental to business </s>
<s> 

its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing
his club </s>
<s>  but theyre clever and we cant get on in our line
without em </s>
<s>   charley show oliver to bed </s>
<s> 

i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had
he </s>
<s>  inquired charley bates </s>
<s> 

certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which
charley put the question </s>
<s> 

master bates apparently much delighted with his commission took the
cleft stick </s>
<s>  and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were
two or three of the beds on which he had slept before </s>
<s>  and here with
many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old
suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon
leaving off at <abvr> brownlows </s>
<s>  and the accidental display of which to
fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue
received of his whereabout </s>
<s> 

put off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to
take care of </s>
<s>   what fun it is </s>
<s> 

poor oliver unwillingly complied </s>
<s>   master bates rolling up the new
clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the
dark and locking the door behind him </s>
<s> 

the noise of charleys laughter and the voice of miss betsy who
opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other
feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept
many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which
oliver was placed </s>
<s>   but he was sick and weary </s>
<s>  and he soon fell sound
asleep </s>

chapter xvii

olivers destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great man to london
to injure his reputation

it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to
present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as
the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon </s>
<s>   the hero sinks
upon his straw bed weighed down by fetters and misfortunes </s>
<s>  in the
next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience
with a comic song </s>
<s>   we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in
the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron </s>
<s>  her virtue and her life alike
in danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of
the other </s>
<s>  and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest
pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the
great hall of the castle </s>
<s>  where a greyheaded seneschal sings a funny
chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of all sorts of
places from church vaults to palaces and roam about in company
carolling perpetually </s>
<s> 

such changes appear absurd </s>
<s>  but they are not so unnatural as they would
seem at first sight </s>
<s>   the transitions in real life from wellspread
boards to deathbeds and from mourningweeds to holiday garments are
not a whit less startling </s>
<s>  only there we are busy actors instead of
passive lookerson which makes a vast difference </s>
<s>   the actors in the
mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt
impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the eyes of
mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous </s>
<s> 

as sudden shiftings of the scene and rapid changes of time and place
are not only sanctioned in books by long usage but are by many
considered as the great art of authorship </s>
<s>  an authors skill in his
craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the
dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every </s>
<s> </s>
<s> 
this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed
unnecessary </s>
<s>   if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the
part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver
twist was born </s>
<s>  the reader taking it for granted that there are good
and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be
invited to proceed upon such an expedition </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble emerged at early morning from the workhousegate and walked
with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street </s>
<s>   he was
in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood </s>
<s>  his cocked hat and coat were
dazzling in the morning sun </s>
<s>  he clutched his cane with the vigorous
tenacity of health and power </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble always carried his head high </s>
<s> 
but this morning it was higher than usual </s>
<s>   there was an abstraction in
his eye an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for
utterance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and
others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along </s>
<s>   he merely
returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in
his dignified pace until he reached the farm where <abvr> mann tended
the infant paupers with parochial care </s>
<s> 

drat that beadle </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann hearing the wellknown shaking at
the gardengate </s>
<s>   if it isnt him at this time in the morning </s>
<s>   lauk
mr </s>
<s>  bumble only think of its being you </s>
<s>   well dear me it is a
pleasure this is </s>
<s>   come into the parlour sir please </s>
<s> 

the first sentence was addressed to susan </s>
<s>  and the exclamations of
delight were uttered to <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  as the good lady unlocked the
gardengate </s>
<s>  and showed him with great attention and respect into the
house </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  not sitting upon or dropping himself
into a seat as any common jackanapes would </s>
<s>  but letting himself
gradually and slowly down into a chair </s>
<s>  <abvr> mann maam good
morning </s>
<s> 

well and good morning to you sir replied <abvr> mann with many
smiles </s>
<s>  and hoping you find yourself well sir </s>
<s> 

soso <abvr> mann replied the beadle </s>
<s>   a porochial life is not a bed
of roses <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

ah that it isnt indeed <abvr> bumble rejoined the lady </s>
<s>  and all the
infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety
if they had heard it </s>
<s> 

a porochial life maam continued <abvr> bumble striking the table
with his cane is a life of worrit and vexation and hardihood </s>
<s>  but
all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her
hands with a look of sympathy and sighed </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   you may well sigh <abvr> mann </s>
<s>  said the beadle </s>
<s> 

finding she had done right <abvr> mann sighed again </s>
<s>   evidently to the
satisfaction of the public character </s>
<s>   who repressing a complacent
smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat said

mrs </s>
<s>  mann i am going to london </s>

lauk <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> mann starting back </s>
<s>

settlement </s>

to the matter before the quartersessions at clerkinwell </s>
<s> 

and i very much question added <abvr> bumble drawing himself up
whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
box before they have done with me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you mustnt be too hard upon them sir said <abvr> mann coaxingly </s>
<s> 

the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves maam
replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they
come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have
only themselves to thank </s>
<s> 

there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
manner in which <abvr> bumble delivered himself of these words that <abvr>
mann appeared quite awed by them </s>
<s>  at length she said

youre going by coach sir </s>
<s>   i thought it was always usual to send
them paupers in carts </s>
<s> 

thats when theyre ill <abvr> mann said the beadle </s>

sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their
taking cold </s>

oh </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann </s>

the opposition coach contracts for these two </s>

said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   they are both in a very low state and we find it
would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury emthat is if
we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to
do if they dont die upon the road to spite us </s>

<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

when <abvr> bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered
the cocked hat </s>
<s>  and he became grave </s>
<s> 

we are forgetting business maam said the beadle </s>
<s>  here is your
porochial stipend for the month </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his
pocketbook </s>
<s>  and requested a receipt </s>
<s>   which <abvr> mann wrote </s>
<s> 

its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants </s>
<s>  but its
formal enough i dare say </s>
<s>   thank you <abvr> bumble sir i am very much
obliged to you im sure </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of <abvr> manns curtsey </s>
<s> 
and inquired how the children were </s>
<s> 

bless their dear little hearts </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann with emotion theyre
as well as can be the dears </s>
<s>   of course except the two that died last
week </s>
<s>   and little dick </s>
<s> 

isnt that boy no better </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  mann shook her head </s>
<s> 

hes a illconditioned wicious baddisposed porochial child that
said <abvr> bumble angrily </s>
<s>   where is he </s>
<s> 

ill bring him to you in one minute sir replied <abvr> mann </s>
<s>  here
you dick </s>
<s> 

after some calling dick was discovered </s>
<s>   having had his face put under
the pump and dried upon <abvr> manns gown he was led into the awful
presence of <abvr> bumble the beadle </s>
<s> 

the child was pale and thin </s>
<s>  his cheeks were sunken </s>
<s>  and his eyes large
and bright </s>
<s>   the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung
loosely on his feeble body </s>
<s>  and his young limbs had wasted away like
those of an old man </s>
<s> 

such was the little being who stood trembling beneath <abvr> bumbles
glance </s>
<s>  not daring to lift his eyes from the floor </s>
<s>  and dreading even
to hear the beadles voice </s>
<s> 

cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy </s>
<s>  said <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

whats the matter with you porochial dick </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble with
welltimed jocularity </s>
<s> 

nothing sir replied the child faintly </s>
<s> 

i should think not said <abvr> mann who had of course laughed very
much at <abvr> bumbles humour </s>
<s> 

you want for nothing im sure </s>
<s> 

i should like faltered the child </s>
<s> 

heyday </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> mann i suppose youre going to say that you
do want for something now </s>
<s>   why you little wretch

stop <abvr> mann stop </s>
<s>  said the beadle raising his hand with a show
of authority </s>
<s>   like what sir eh </s>
<s> 

i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would
put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and
seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground </s>
<s> 

why what does the boy mean </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> bumble on whom the
earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression </s>
<s> 
accustomed as he was to such things </s>
<s>   what do you mean sir </s>
<s> 

i should like said the child to leave my dear love to poor oliver
twist </s>
<s>  and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to
think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help
him </s>
<s>   and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small
hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to
die when i was very young </s>
<s>  for perhaps if i had lived to be a man
and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me
or be unlike me </s>
<s>  and it would be so much happier if we were both
children there together </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with
indescribable astonishment </s>
<s>  and turning to his companion said
theyre all in one story <abvr> mann </s>
<s>   that outdacious oliver had
demogalized them all </s>
<s> 

i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands
and looking malignantly at dick </s>
<s>   i never see such a hardened little
wretch </s>
<s> 

take him away maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble imperiously </s>
<s>   this must be
stated to the board <abvr> mann </s>
<s> 

i hope the gentleman will understand that it isnt my fault sir </s>
<s> 
said <abvr> mann whimpering pathetically </s>
<s> 

they shall understand that maam </s>
<s>  they shall be acquainted with the
true state of the case said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>  take him away i
cant bear the sight on him </s>
<s> 

dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coalcellar </s>
<s>   <abvr>
bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey </s>
<s> 

at six oclock next morning <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   having exchanged his cocked
hat for a round one and encased his person in a blue greatcoat with a
cape to it </s>
<s>   took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by
the criminals whose settlement was disputed </s>
<s>  with whom in due course
of time he arrived in london </s>
<s> 

he experienced no other crosses on the way than those which originated
in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in
shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which <abvr> bumble
declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel
quite uncomfortable </s>
<s>  although he had a greatcoat on </s>
<s> 

having disposed of these evilminded persons for the night <abvr> bumble
sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped </s>
<s>  and took a
temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter </s>
<s>  putting a glass
of hot ginandwater on the chimneypiece he drew his chair to the
fire </s>
<s>  and with sundry moral reflections on the tooprevalent sin of
discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper </s>
<s> 

the very first paragraph upon which <abvr> bumbles eye rested was the
following advertisement </s>
<s> 

                 five guineas reward

whereas a young boy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on
thursday evening last from his home at pentonville </s>
<s>  and has not since
been heard of </s>
<s>   the above reward will be paid to any person who will
give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver
twist or tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which
the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested </s>
<s> 

and then followed a full description of olivers dress person
appearance and disappearance </s>
<s>   with the name and address of <abvr>
brownlow at full length </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble opened his eyes </s>
<s>  read the advertisement slowly and
carefully three several times </s>
<s>  and in something more than five minutes
was on his way to pentonville </s>
<s>  having actually in his excitement left
the glass of hot ginandwater untasted </s>
<s> 

is <abvr> brownlow at home </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble of the girl who opened
the door </s>
<s> 

to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive
reply of i dont know </s>
<s>  where do you come from </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his
errand than <abvr> bedwin who had been listening at the parlour door
hastened into the passage in a breathless state </s>
<s> 

come in come in said the old lady </s>
<s>  i knew we should hear of him </s>
<s> 
poor dear </s>
<s>   i knew we should </s>
<s>   i was certain of it </s>
<s>   bless his heart </s>
<s> 
i said so all along </s>
<s> 

having heard this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
again </s>
<s>  and seating herself on a sofa burst into tears </s>
<s>  the girl who
was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile </s>
<s>  and now
returned with a request that <abvr> bumble would follow her immediately </s>
<s> 
which he did </s>
<s> 

he was shown into the little back study where sat <abvr> brownlow and his
friend <abvr> grimwig with decanters and glasses before them </s>
<s>   the latter
gentleman at once burst into the exclamation </s>
<s> 

a beadle </s>
<s>   a parish beadle or ill eat my head </s>
<s> 

pray dont interrupt just now said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   take a seat will
you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble sat himself down </s>
<s>  quite confounded by the oddity of <abvr>
grimwigs manner </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow moved the lamp so as to obtain an
uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance </s>
<s>  and said with a little
impatience

now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement </s>
<s> 

yes sir said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

and you are a beadle are you not </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

i am a porochial beadle gentlemen rejoined <abvr> bumble proudly </s>
<s> 

of course observed <abvr> grimwig aside to his friend i knew he was </s>
<s> 
a beadle all over </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and
resumed </s>
<s> 

do you know where this poor boy is now </s>
<s> 

no more than nobody replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

well what do you know of him </s>
<s>  inquired the old gentleman </s>
<s>  speak
out my friend if you have anything to say </s>
<s>   what do you know of him </s>
<s> 

you dont happen to know any good of him do you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig
caustically </s>
<s>  after an attentive perusal of <abvr> bumbles features </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his head with
portentous solemnity </s>
<s> 

you see </s>
<s>  said <abvr> grimwig looking triumphantly at <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow looked apprehensively at <abvr> bumbles pursedup
countenance </s>
<s>  and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding
oliver in as few words as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble put down his hat </s>
<s>  unbuttoned his coat </s>
<s>  folded his arms </s>
<s> 
inclined his head in a retrospective manner </s>
<s>  and after a few moments
reflection commenced his story </s>
<s> 

it would be tedious if given in the beadles words </s>
<s>   occupying as it
did some twenty minutes in the telling </s>
<s>  but the sum and substance of
it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents </s>
<s> 
that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than
treachery ingratitude and malice </s>
<s>   that he had terminated his brief
career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly
attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the nighttime from
his masters house </s>
<s>   in proof of his really being the person he
represented himself <abvr> bumble laid upon the table the papers he had
brought to town </s>
<s>  folding his arms again he then awaited <abvr> brownlows
observations </s>
<s> 

i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after
looking over the papers </s>
<s>   this is not much for your intelligence </s>
<s>  but
i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been
favourable to the boy </s>
<s> 

it is not improbable that if <abvr> bumble had been possessed of this
information at an earlier period of the interview he might have
imparted a very different colouring to his little history </s>
<s>  it was too
late to do it now however </s>
<s>  so he shook his head gravely and
pocketing the five guineas withdrew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes </s>
<s>  evidently so
much disturbed by the beadles tale that even <abvr> grimwig forbore to
vex him further </s>
<s> 

at length he stopped and rang the bell violently </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin said <abvr> brownlow when the housekeeper appeared </s>
<s>  that
boy oliver is an imposter </s>
<s> 

it cant be sir </s>
<s>   it cannot be said the old lady energetically </s>
<s> 

i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman </s>
<s>   what do you mean by
cant be </s>
<s>   we have just heard a full account of him from his birth </s>
<s>  and
he has been a thoroughpaced little villain all his life </s>
<s> 

i never will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly </s>
<s>  never </s>
<s> 

you old women never believe anything but quackdoctors and lying
storybooks growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s>   i knew it all along </s>
<s>  why didnt
you take my advise in the beginning </s>
<s>  you would if he hadnt had a
fever i suppose eh </s>
<s>   he was interesting wasnt he </s>
<s>   interesting </s>
<s> 
bah </s>
<s>   and <abvr> grimwig poked the fire with a flourish </s>
<s> 

he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted <abvr> bedwin
indignantly </s>
<s>   i know what children are sir </s>
<s>  and have done these forty
years </s>
<s>  and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about
them </s>
<s>   thats my opinion </s>
<s> 

this was a hard hit at <abvr> grimwig who was a bachelor </s>
<s>   as it extorted
nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head
and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was
stopped by <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

silence </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from
feeling </s>
<s>   never let me hear the boys name again </s>
<s>   i rang to tell you
that </s>
<s>   never </s>
<s>   never on any pretence mind </s>
<s>   you may leave the room
mrs </s>
<s>  bedwin </s>
<s>   remember </s>
<s>   i am in earnest </s>
<s> 

there were sad hearts at <abvr> brownlows that night </s>
<s> 

olivers heart sank within him when he thought of his good friends </s>
<s>  it
was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it
might have broken outright </s>

chapter xviii

how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable
friends

about noon next day when the dodger and master bates had gone out to
pursue their customary avocations <abvr> fagin took the opportunity of
reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude </s>
<s>  of
which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary
extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious
friends </s>
<s>  and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so
much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery </s>
<s>  <abvr> fagin
laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and
cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished
with hunger </s>
<s>  and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young
lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel
circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing
a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be
hanged at the old bailey one morning </s>
<s>   <abvr> fagin did not seek to
conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his
eyes that the wrongheaded and treacherous behaviour of the young
person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the
victim of certain evidence for the crown </s>
<s>  which if it were not
precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him <abvr>
fagin and a few select friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> fagin concluded by drawing a
rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging </s>
<s>  and with
great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious
hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that
unpleasant operation </s>
<s> 

little olivers blood ran cold as he listened to the jews words and
imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them </s>
<s>   that it
was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the
guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already </s>
<s>  and
that deeplylaid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or
overcommunicative persons had been really devised and carried out by
the jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely
when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that
gentleman and <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  which seemed to bear reference to some
foregone conspiracy of the kind </s>
<s>   as he glanced timidly up and met the
jews searching look he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs
were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman </s>
<s> 

the jew smiling hideously patted oliver on the head and said that
if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they
would be very good friends yet </s>
<s>   then taking his hat and covering
himself with an old patched greatcoat he went out and locked the
roomdoor behind him </s>
<s> 

and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many
subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and
left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts </s>
<s>   which
never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must
long ago have formed of him were sad indeed </s>
<s> 

after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the roomdoor unlocked </s>
<s> 
and he was at liberty to wander about the house </s>
<s> 

it was a very dirty place </s>
<s>   the rooms upstairs had great high wooden
chimneypieces and large doors with panelled walls and cornices to the
ceiling </s>
<s>  which although they were black with neglect and dust were
ornamented in various ways </s>
<s>   from all of these tokens oliver concluded
that a long time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to
better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome </s>
<s>   dismal and
dreary as it looked now </s>
<s> 

spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings </s>
<s> 
and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would
scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes </s>
<s>   with
these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living
thing </s>
<s>  and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from
room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the
streetdoor to be as near living people as he could </s>
<s>  and would remain
there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys
returned </s>
<s> 

in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed </s>
<s>   the bars
which held them were screwed tight into the wood </s>
<s>  the only light which
was admitted stealing its way through round holes at the top </s>
<s>  which
made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows </s>
<s> 
there was a backgarret window with rusty bars outside which had no
shutter </s>
<s>  and out of this oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for
hours together </s>
<s>  but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused
and crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gableends </s>
<s> 
sometimes indeed a grizzly head might be seen peering over the
parapetwall of a distant house </s>
<s>  but it was quickly withdrawn again </s>
<s> 
and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed
with the rain and smoke of years it was as much as he could do to make
out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any
attempt to be seen or heardwhich he had as much chance of being as
if he had lived inside the ball of st </s>
<s>  pauls cathedral </s>
<s> 

one afternoon the dodger and master bates being engaged out that
evening the firstnamed young gentleman took it into his head to
evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person to do him
justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him </s>
<s>  and with
this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in
his toilet straightway </s>
<s> 

oliver was but too glad to make himself useful </s>
<s>  too happy to have some
faces however bad to look upon </s>
<s>  too desirous to conciliate those
about him when he could honestly do so </s>
<s>  to throw any objection in the
way of this proposal </s>
<s>   so he at once expressed his readiness </s>
<s>  and
kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the table so that he
could take his foot in his laps he applied himself to a process which
mr </s>
<s>  dawkins designated as japanning his trottercases </s>
<s>   the phrase
rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots </s>
<s> 

whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy
attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and
having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of
having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to
disturb his reflections </s>
<s>  or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco
that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer
that mollified his thoughts </s>
<s>  he was evidently tinctured for the nonce
with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature </s>
<s> 
he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief
space </s>
<s>  and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sign said
half in abstraction and half to master bates </s>
<s> 

what a pity it is he isnt a prig </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said master charles bates </s>
<s>  he dont know whats good for him </s>
<s> 

the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe </s>
<s>  as did charley bates </s>
<s> 
they both smoked for some seconds in silence </s>
<s> 

i suppose you dont even know what a prig is </s>
<s>  said the dodger
mournfully </s>
<s> 

i think i know that replied oliver looking up </s>
<s>   its a the </s>
<s> 
youre one are you not </s>
<s>  inquired oliver checking himself </s>
<s> 

i am replied the dodger </s>
<s>   id scorn to be anything else </s>
<s>   <abvr>
dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment
and looked at master bates as if to denote that he would feel obliged
by his saying anything to the contrary </s>
<s> 

i am repeated the dodger </s>
<s>   sos charley </s>
<s>   sos fagin </s>
<s>  sos sikes </s>
<s> 
sos nancy </s>
<s>   sos bet </s>
<s>   so we all are down to the dog </s>
<s>  and hes the
downiest one of the lot </s>
<s> 

and the least given to peaching added charley bates </s>
<s> 

he wouldnt so much as bark in a witnessbox for fear of committing
himself </s>
<s>  no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without
wittles for a fortnight said the dodger </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it observed charley </s>
<s> 

hes a rum dog </s>
<s>   dont he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs
or sings when hes in company </s>
<s>  pursued the dodger </s>
<s>  wont he growl at
all when he hears a fiddle playing </s>
<s>   and dont he hate other dogs as
aint of his breed </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s> 

hes an outandout christian said charley </s>
<s> 

this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it
was an appropriate remark in another sense if master bates had only
known it </s>
<s>  for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen claiming to
be outandout christians between whom and <abvr> sikes dog there
exist strong and singular points of resemblance </s>
<s> 

well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they
had strayed </s>
<s>  with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced
all his proceedings </s>
<s>   this hasnt go anything to do with young green
here </s>
<s> 

no more it has said charley </s>
<s>   why dont you put yourself under
fagin oliver </s>
<s> 

and make your fortun out of hand </s>
<s>  added the dodger with a grin </s>
<s> 

and so be able to retire on your property and do the genteel </s>
<s>  as i
mean to in the very next leapyear but four that ever comes and the
fortysecond tuesday in trinityweek said charley bates </s>
<s> 

i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly </s>
<s>  i wish they would let me
go </s>
<s>   iiwould rather go </s>
<s> 

and fagin would rather not </s>
<s>  rejoined charley </s>
<s> 

oliver knew this too well </s>
<s>  but thinking it might be dangerous to
express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his
bootcleaning </s>
<s> 

go </s>
<s>  exclaimed the dodger </s>
<s>   why wheres your spirit </s>
<s>  dont you take
any pride out of yourself </s>
<s>   would you go and be dependent on your
friends </s>
<s> 

oh blow that </s>
<s>  said master bates </s>
<s>  drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard
thats too mean </s>
<s>  that is </s>
<s> 

i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust </s>
<s> 

you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile </s>
<s> 
and let them be punished for what you did </s>
<s> 

that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out
of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work
together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our
lucky </s>
<s>  that was the move wasnt it charley </s>
<s> 

master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection
of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was
inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and
down into his throat </s>
<s>  and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping
about five minutes long </s>
<s> 

look here </s>
<s>  said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and
halfpence </s>
<s>  heres a jolly life </s>
<s>   whats the odds where it comes from </s>
<s> 
here catch hold </s>
<s>  theres plenty more where they were took from </s>
<s>   you
wont wont you </s>
<s>   oh you precious flat </s>
<s> 

its naughty aint it oliver </s>
<s>  inquired charley bates </s>
<s>  hell come
to be scragged wont he </s>
<s> 

i dont know what that means replied oliver </s>
<s> 

something in this way old feller said charly </s>
<s>   as he said it
master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief </s>
<s>  and holding it erect
in the air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious
sound through his teeth </s>
<s>  thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic
representation that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing </s>
<s> 

thats what it means said charley </s>
<s>   look how he stares jack </s>
<s> 

i never did see such prime company as that ere boy </s>
<s>  hell be the death
of me i know he will </s>
<s>   master charley bates having laughed heartily
again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes </s>
<s> 

youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with
much satisfaction when oliver had polished them </s>
<s>  fagin will make
something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that
turned out unprofitable </s>
<s>   youd better begin at once </s>
<s>  for youll come
to the trade long before you think of it </s>
<s>  and youre only losing time
oliver </s>
<s> 

master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his
own </s>
<s>   which being exhausted he and his friend <abvr> dawkins launched
into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the
life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the
best thing he could do would be to secure fagins favour without more
delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it </s>
<s> 

and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew
was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogels and
tickers

whats the good of talking in that way </s>
<s>  interposed master bates </s>
<s>  he
dont know what you mean </s>
<s> 

if you dont take pockethandkechers and watches said the dodger
reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some
other cove will </s>
<s>  so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse
and youll be all the worse too and nobody half a haporth the
better except the chaps wot gets themand youve just as good a right
to them as they have </s>
<s> 

to be sure to be sure </s>
<s>  said the jew who had entered unseen by
oliver </s>
<s>   it all lies in a nutshell my dear </s>
<s>  in a nutshell take the
dodgers word for it </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   he understands the catechism of his
trade </s>
<s> 

the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated the
dodgers reasoning in these terms </s>
<s>  and chuckled with delight at his
pupils proficiency </s>
<s> 

the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had
returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver
had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom
chitling </s>
<s>  and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
gallantries with the lady now made his appearance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  chitling was older in years than the dodger </s>
<s>  having perhaps
numbered eighteen winters </s>
<s>  but there was a degree of deference in his
deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that
he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius
and professional aquirements </s>
<s>   he had small twinkling eyes and a
pockmarked face </s>
<s>  wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy
fustian trousers and an apron </s>
<s>   his wardrobe was in truth rather out
of repair </s>
<s>  but he excused himself to the company by stating that his
time was only out an hour before </s>
<s>  and that in consequence of having
worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow
any attention on his private clothes </s>
<s>   <abvr> chitling added with strong
marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder
was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there
was no remedy against the county </s>
<s>   the same remark he considered to
apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair </s>
<s>  which he held to be
decidedly unlawful </s>
<s>   <abvr> chitling wound up his observations by stating
that he had not touched a drop of anything for fortytwo moral long
hardworking days </s>
<s>  and that he wished he might be busted if he warnt
as dry as a limebasket </s>
<s> 

where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver </s>
<s>  inquired the
jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the
table </s>
<s> 

iidont know sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

whos that </s>
<s>  inquired tom chitling casting a contemptuous look at
oliver </s>
<s> 

a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew </s>
<s> 

hes in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin </s>
<s> 
never mind where i came from young un </s>
<s>  youll find your way there
soon enough ill bet a crown </s>
<s> 

at this sally the boys laughed </s>
<s>   after some more jokes on the same
subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin </s>
<s>  and withdrew </s>
<s> 

after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew
their chairs towards the fire </s>
<s>  and the jew telling oliver to come and
sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to
interest his hearers </s>
<s>   these were the great advantages of the trade
the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the
liberality of the jew himself </s>
<s>   at length these subjects displayed
signs of being thoroughly exhausted </s>
<s>  and <abvr> chitling did the same </s>
<s> 
for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two </s>
<s> 
miss betsy accordingly withdrew </s>
<s>  and left the party to their repose </s>
<s> 

from this day oliver was seldom left alone </s>
<s>  but was placed in almost
constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with
the jew every day </s>
<s>  whether for their own improvement or olivers <abvr>
fagin best knew </s>
<s>   at other times the old man would tell them stories of
robberies he had committed in his younger days </s>
<s>   mixed up with so much
that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing
heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better
feelings </s>
<s> 

in short the wily old jew had the boy in his toils </s>
<s>   having prepared
his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the
companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place he was
now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would
blacken it and change its hue for ever </s>

chapter xix

in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on

it was a chill damp windy night when the jew </s>
<s>  buttoning his
greatcoat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up
over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face </s>
<s> 
emerged from his den </s>
<s>   he paused on the step as the door was locked and
chained behind him </s>
<s>  and having listened while the boys made all secure
and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down
the street as quickly as he could </s>
<s> 

the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of
whitechapel </s>
<s>   the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the
street </s>
<s>  and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck
off in the direction of the spitalfields </s>
<s> 

the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the
streets </s>
<s>  the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and
clammy to the touch </s>
<s>   it seemed just the night when it befitted such a
being as the jew to be abroad </s>
<s>   as he glided stealthily along creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old man
seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and
darkness through which he moved </s>
<s>  crawling forth by night in search of
some rich offal for a meal </s>
<s> 

he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he
reached bethnal green </s>
<s>  then turning suddenly off to the left he soon
became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
that close and denselypopulated quarter </s>
<s> 

the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be
at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the
intricacies of the way </s>
<s>   he hurried through several alleys and streets
and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the
farther end </s>
<s>   at the door of a house in this street he knocked </s>
<s>  having
exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it he walked
upstairs </s>
<s> 

a dog growled as he touched the handle of a roomdoor </s>
<s>  and a mans
voice demanded who was there </s>
<s> 

only me bill </s>
<s>  only me my dear said the jew looking in </s>
<s> 

bring in your body then said sikes </s>
<s>   lie down you stupid brute </s>
<s> 
dont you know the devil when hes got a greatcoat on </s>
<s> 

apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by <abvr> fagins outer
garment </s>
<s>  for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a
chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen </s>
<s>   wagging his
tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his
nature to be </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s> 

well my dear replied the jew </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  nancy </s>
<s> 

the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
imply a doubt of its reception </s>
<s>  for <abvr> fagin and his young friend had
not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver </s>
<s>   all doubts upon
the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys
behaviour </s>
<s>   she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair
and bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it </s>
<s>   for it was a
cold night and no mistake </s>
<s> 

it is cold nancy dear said the jew as he warmed his skinny hands
over the fire </s>
<s>   it seems to go right through one added the old man
touching his side </s>
<s> 

it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said
mr </s>
<s>  sikes </s>
<s>   give him something to drink nancy </s>
<s>   burn my body make
haste </s>
<s>   its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old carcase
shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave </s>
<s> 

nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were
many </s>
<s>   which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were
filled with several kinds of liquids </s>
<s>   sikes pouring out a glass of
brandy bade the jew drink it off </s>
<s> 

quite enough quite thankye bill replied the jew putting down the
glass after just setting his lips to it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>   youre afraid of our getting the better of you are you </s>
<s> 
inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew </s>
<s>   ugh </s>
<s> 

with a hoarse grunt of contempt <abvr> sikes seized the glass and threw
the remainder of its contents into the ashes </s>
<s>  as a preparatory ceremony
to filling it again for himself </s>
<s>   which he did at once </s>
<s> 

the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second
glassful </s>
<s>  not in curiousity for he had seen it often before </s>
<s>  but in a
restless and suspicious manner habitual to him </s>
<s>  it was a meanly
furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to
induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man </s>
<s>  and
with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a lifepreserver that
hung over the chimneypiece </s>
<s> 

there said sikes smacking his lips </s>
<s>  now im ready </s>
<s> 

for business </s>
<s>  inquired the jew </s>
<s> 

for business replied sikes </s>
<s>  so say what youve got to say </s>
<s> 

about the crib at chertsey bill </s>
<s>  said the jew drawing his chair
forward and speaking in a very low voice </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   wot about it </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you know what i mean my dear said the jew </s>
<s>   he knows what i
mean nancy </s>
<s>  dont he </s>
<s> 

no he dont sneered <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   or he wont and thats the same
thing </s>
<s>   speak out and call things by their right names </s>
<s>  dont sit
there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you
warnt the very first that thought about the robbery </s>
<s>   wot dye mean </s>
<s> 

hush bill hush </s>
<s>  said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop
this burst of indignation </s>
<s>  somebody will hear us my dear </s>
<s>  somebody
will hear us </s>
<s> 

let em hear </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>  i dont care </s>
<s>   but as <abvr> sikes did care
on reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew
calmer </s>
<s> 

there there said the jew coaxingly </s>
<s>   it was only my caution
nothing more </s>
<s>   now my dear about that crib at chertsey </s>
<s>  when is it to
be done bill eh </s>
<s>   when is it to be done </s>
<s>   such plate my dear such
plate </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in
a rapture of anticipation </s>
<s> 

not at all replied sikes coldly </s>
<s> 

not to be done at all </s>
<s>  echoed the jew leaning back in his chair </s>
<s> 

no not at all rejoined sikes </s>
<s>   at least it cant be a putup job
as we expected </s>
<s> 

then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale
with anger </s>
<s>   dont tell me </s>
<s> 

but i will tell you retorted sikes </s>
<s>   who are you thats not to be
told </s>
<s>   i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place
for a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants in line </s>
<s> 

do you mean to tell me bill said the jew </s>
<s>  softening as the other
grew heated </s>
<s>   that neither of the two men in the house can be got
over </s>
<s> 

yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes </s>
<s>   the old lady has had
em these twenty years </s>
<s>  and if you were to give em five hundred pound
they wouldnt be in it </s>
<s> 

but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the
women cant be got over </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied sikes </s>
<s> 

not by flash toby crackit </s>
<s>  said the jew incredulously </s>
<s>  think what
women are bill

no </s>
<s>  not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes </s>
<s>   he says hes
worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes
been loitering down there and its all of no use </s>
<s> 

he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my
dear said the jew </s>
<s> 

so he did rejoined sikes and they warnt of no more use than the
other plant </s>
<s> 

the jew looked blank at this information </s>
<s>   after ruminating for some
minutes with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his head and said
with a deep sigh that if flash toby crackit reported aright he feared
the game was up </s>
<s> 

and yet said the old man dropping his hands on his knees its a
sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it </s>
<s> 

so it is said <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   worse luck </s>
<s> 

a long silence ensued </s>
<s>  during which the jew was plunged in deep
thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy
perfectly demoniacal </s>
<s>   sikes eyed him furtively from time to time </s>
<s> 
nancy apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her
eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed </s>
<s> 

fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed </s>
<s> 
is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the outside </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself </s>
<s> 

is it a bargain </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

yes my dear yes rejoined the jew </s>
<s>  his eyes glistening and every
muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had
awakened </s>
<s> 

then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain
let it come off as soon as you like </s>
<s>   toby and me were over the
gardenwall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and
shutters </s>
<s>   the cribs barred up at night like a jail </s>
<s>  but theres one
part we can crack safe and softly </s>
<s> 

which is that bill </s>
<s>  asked the jew eagerly </s>
<s> 

why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn

yes </s>
<s>  said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost
starting out of it </s>
<s> 

umph </s>
<s>  cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her
head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews
face </s>
<s>   never mind which part it is </s>
<s>  you cant do it without me i
know </s>
<s>  but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you </s>
<s> 

as you like my dear as you like replied the jew </s>
<s>   is there no help
wanted but yours and tobys </s>
<s> 

none said sikes </s>
<s>   cept a centrebit and a boy </s>
<s>   the first weve
both got </s>
<s>  the second you must find us </s>
<s> 

a boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  then its a panel eh </s>
<s> 

never mind wot it is </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s>   i want a boy and he musnt be
a big un </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  said <abvr> sikes reflectively if id only got that
young boy of ned the chimbleysweepers </s>
<s>   he kept him small on
purpose and let him out by the job </s>
<s>   but the father gets lagged </s>
<s>  and
then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from
a trade where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and
in time makes a prentice of him </s>
<s>   and so they go on said <abvr> sikes
his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on </s>
<s> 
and if theyd got money enough which its a providence they havent
we shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year
or two </s>
<s> 

no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering
during this speech and had only caught the last sentence </s>
<s>  bill </s>
<s> 

what now </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the
fire </s>
<s>  and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave
the room </s>
<s>   sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought
the precaution unnecessary </s>
<s>  but complied nevertheless by requesting
miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer </s>
<s> 

you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining
her seat very composedly </s>
<s> 

i tell you i do </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s> 

nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin </s>
<s>   i know what hes
going to say bill </s>
<s>  he neednt mind me </s>
<s> 

the jew still hesitated </s>
<s>   sikes looked from one to the other in some
surprise </s>
<s> 

why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin </s>
<s>  he asked at length </s>
<s> 
youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it </s>
<s>   she
aint one to blab </s>
<s>   are you nancy </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  replied the young lady </s>
<s>   drawing her chair up
to the table and putting her elbows upon it </s>
<s> 

no no my dear i know youre not said the jew </s>
<s>  but and again
the old man paused </s>
<s> 

but wot </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

i didnt know whether she mightnt praps be out of sorts you know
my dear as she was the other night replied the jew </s>
<s> 

at this confession miss nancy burst into a loud laugh </s>
<s>  and swallowing
a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst
into sundry exclamations of keep the game agoing </s>
<s>   never say die </s>
<s> 
and the like </s>
<s>   these seemed to have the effect of reassuring both
gentlemen </s>
<s>  for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and
resumed his seat </s>
<s>  as did <abvr> sikes likewise </s>
<s> 

now fagin said nancy with a laugh </s>
<s>   tell bill at once about
oliver </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  youre a clever one my dear </s>
<s>  the sharpest girl i ever saw </s>
<s>  said
the jew patting her on the neck </s>
<s>   it was about oliver i was going to
speak sure enough </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

what about him </s>
<s>  demanded sikes </s>
<s> 

hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper </s>
<s> 
laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully </s>
<s> 

he </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes </s>
<s> 

have him bill </s>
<s>  said nancy </s>
<s>   i would if i was in your place </s>
<s>  he
maynt be so much up as any of the others </s>
<s>  but thats not what you
want if hes only to open a door for you </s>
<s>   depend upon it hes a safe
one bill </s>
<s> 

i know he is rejoined fagin </s>
<s>   hes been in good training these last
few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread </s>
<s>   besides the
others are all too big </s>
<s> 

well he is just the size i want said <abvr> sikes ruminating </s>
<s> 

and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew </s>
<s> 
he cant help himself </s>
<s>   that is if you frighten him enough </s>
<s> 

frighten him </s>
<s>  echoed sikes </s>
<s>   itll be no sham frightening mind you </s>
<s> 
if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the work </s>
<s>  in
for a penny in for a pound </s>
<s>   you wont see him alive again fagin </s>
<s> 
think of that before you send him </s>
<s>   mark my words </s>
<s>  said the robber
poising a crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead </s>
<s> 

ive thought of it all said the jew with energy </s>
<s>  iveive had my
eye upon him my dears closeclose </s>
<s>  once let him feel that he is one
of us </s>
<s>  once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief </s>
<s>  and
hes ours </s>
<s>   ours for his life </s>
<s>   oho </s>
<s>   it couldnt have come about
better </s>
<s>   the old man crossed his arms upon his breast </s>
<s>  and drawing his
head and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy </s>
<s> 

ours </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>   yours you mean </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle </s>
<s>  mine if
you like bill </s>
<s> 

and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot
makes you take so much pains about one chalkfaced kid when you know
there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you
might pick and choose from </s>
<s> 

because theyre of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some
confusion not worth the taking </s>
<s>   their looks convict em when they
get into trouble and i lose em all </s>
<s>   with this boy properly managed
my dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them </s>
<s>   besides
said the jew recovering his selfpossession he has us now if he
could only give us legbail again </s>
<s>  and he must be in the same boat with
us </s>
<s>   never mind how he came there </s>
<s>  its quite enough for my power over
him that he was in a robbery </s>
<s>  thats all i want </s>
<s>   now how much better
this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the
waywhich would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides </s>
<s> 

when is it to be done </s>
<s>  asked nancy stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of <abvr> sikes expressive of the disgust with
which he received fagins affectation of humanity </s>
<s> 

ah to be sure said the jew </s>
<s>  when is it to be done bill </s>
<s> 

i planned with toby the night arter tomorrow rejoined sikes in a
surly voice if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy </s>
<s> 

good said the jew </s>
<s>  theres no moon </s>
<s> 

no rejoined sikes </s>
<s> 

its all arranged about bringing off the swag is it </s>
<s>  asked the jew </s>
<s> 

sikes nodded </s>
<s> 

and about

oh ah its all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him </s>
<s>  never
mind particulars </s>
<s>   youd better bring the boy here tomorrow night </s>
<s>   i
shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak </s>
<s>   then you hold your
tongue and keep the meltingpot ready and thats all youll have to
do </s>
<s> 

after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was
decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the
night had set in and bring oliver away with her </s>
<s>  fagin craftily
observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would
be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in
his behalf than anybody else </s>
<s>   it was also solemnly arranged that poor
oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be
unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of <abvr> william sikes </s>
<s> 
and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought
fit </s>
<s>  and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or
evil that might be necessary to visit him </s>
<s>  it being understood that to
render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by
mr </s>
<s>  sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and
corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash
toby crackit </s>
<s> 

these preliminaries adjusted <abvr> sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner </s>
<s> 
yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song
mingled with wild execrations </s>
<s>   at length in a fit of professional
enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools </s>
<s> 
which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of
explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it
contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he
fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell </s>
<s> 

goodnight nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before </s>
<s> 

goodnight </s>
<s> 

their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly </s>
<s>   there was no
flinching about the girl </s>
<s>   she was as true and earnest in the matter as
toby crackit himself could be </s>
<s> 

the jew again bade her goodnight and bestowing a sly kick upon the
prostrate form of <abvr> sikes while her back was turned groped
downstairs </s>
<s> 

always the way </s>
<s>  muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward </s>
<s> 
the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call
up some longforgotten feeling </s>
<s>  and the best of them is that it never
lasts </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   the man against the child for a bag of gold </s>
<s> 

beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections <abvr> fagin wended
his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode </s>
<s>   where the dodger
was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return </s>
<s> 

is oliver abed </s>
<s>   i want to speak to him was his first remark as
they descended the stairs </s>
<s> 

hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door </s>
<s>   here he is </s>
<s> 

the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor </s>
<s>  so pale
with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he
looked like death </s>
<s>  not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in
the guise it wears when life has just departed </s>
<s>  when a young and gentle
spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the
world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed </s>
<s> 

not now said the jew turning softly away </s>
<s>   tomorrow </s>
<s>  tomorrow </s>

chapter xx

wherein oliver is delivered over to <abvr> william sikes

when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find
that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at
his bedside </s>
<s>  and that his old shoes had been removed </s>
<s>  at first he was
pleased with the discovery </s>
<s>  hoping that it might be the forerunner of
his release </s>
<s>  but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting
down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and
manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the
residence of bill sikes that night </s>
<s> 

totostop there sir </s>
<s>  asked oliver anxiously </s>
<s> 

no no my dear </s>
<s>   not to stop there replied the jew </s>
<s>   we shouldnt
like to lose you </s>
<s>   dont be afraid oliver you shall come back to us
again </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear </s>
<s> 
oh no no </s>
<s> 

the old man who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread
looked round as he bantered oliver thus </s>
<s>  and chuckled as if to show
that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could </s>
<s> 

i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know
what youre going to bills foreh my dear </s>
<s> 

oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been
reading his thoughts </s>
<s>  but boldly said yes he did want to know </s>
<s> 

why do you think </s>
<s>  inquired fagin parrying the question </s>
<s> 

indeed i dont know sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

bah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from
a close perusal of the boys face </s>
<s>   wait till bill tells you then </s>
<s> 

the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject </s>
<s>  but the truth is that although oliver felt
very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
fagins looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries
just then </s>
<s>   he had no other opportunity </s>
<s>   for the jew remained very
surly and silent till night </s>
<s>   when he prepared to go abroad </s>
<s> 

you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table </s>
<s> 
and heres a book for you to read till they come to fetch you </s>
<s> 
goodnight </s>
<s> 

goodnight </s>
<s>  replied oliver softly </s>
<s> 

the jew walked to the door </s>
<s>  looking over his shoulder at the boy as he
went </s>
<s>   suddenly stopping he called him by his name </s>
<s> 

oliver looked up </s>
<s>  the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to
light it </s>
<s>   he did so </s>
<s>  and as he placed the candlestick upon the table
saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and
contracted brows from the dark end of the room </s>
<s> 

take heed oliver </s>
<s>  take heed </s>
<s>  said the old man shaking his right
hand before him in a warning manner </s>
<s>   hes a rough man and thinks
nothing of blood when his own is up </s>
<s>  whatever falls out say nothing </s>
<s> 
and do what he bids you </s>
<s>   mind </s>
<s>   placing a strong emphasis on the last
word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a
ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room </s>
<s> 

oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared and
pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard </s>
<s>   the
more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to
divine its real purpose and meaning </s>
<s> 

he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes
which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin </s>
<s> 
and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been
selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker
until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged </s>
<s>   he
was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where
he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely </s>
<s>   he remained
lost in thought for some minutes </s>
<s>  and then with a heavy sigh snuffed
the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him
began to read </s>
<s> 

he turned over the leaves </s>
<s>   carelessly at first </s>
<s>  but lighting on a
passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the
volume </s>
<s>   it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals </s>
<s> 
and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use </s>
<s>  here he read of
dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold </s>
<s>  of secret murders that
had been committed by the lonely wayside </s>
<s>  of bodies hidden from the eye
of man in deep pits and wells </s>
<s>  which would not keep them down deep as
they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so
maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had
confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony </s>
<s> 
here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night
had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad thoughts
to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs
quail to think of </s>
<s>   the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid
that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore </s>
<s>  and the words upon
them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow
murmurs by the spirits of the dead </s>
<s> 

in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him </s>
<s> 
then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such
deeds </s>
<s>  and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved
for crimes so fearful and appalling </s>
<s>  by degrees he grew more calm
and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from
his present dangers </s>
<s>  and that if any aid were to be raised up for a
poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it
might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in
the midst of wickedness and guilt </s>
<s> 

he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in
his hands when a rustling noise aroused him </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure
standing by the door </s>
<s>   whos there </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>   only me replied a tremulous voice </s>
<s> 

oliver raised the candle above his head </s>
<s>  and looked towards the door </s>
<s> 
it was nancy </s>
<s> 

put down the light said the girl turning away her head </s>
<s>  it hurts
my eyes </s>
<s> 

oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill </s>
<s> 
the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him </s>
<s>   and
wrung her hands </s>
<s>  but made no reply </s>
<s> 

god forgive me </s>
<s>  she cried after a while i never thought of this </s>
<s> 

has anything happened </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s>   can i help you </s>
<s>   i will if i
can </s>
<s>   i will indeed </s>
<s> 

she rocked herself to and fro </s>
<s>  caught her throat </s>
<s>  and uttering a
gurgling sound gasped for breath </s>
<s> 

nancy </s>
<s>  cried oliver what is it </s>
<s> 

the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground </s>
<s> 
and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her </s>
<s>  and shivered
with cold </s>
<s> 

oliver stirred the fire </s>
<s>   drawing her chair close to it she sat there
for a little time without speaking </s>
<s>  but at length she raised her head
and looked round </s>
<s> 

i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to
busy herself in arranging her dress </s>
<s>  its this damp dirty room i
think </s>
<s>   now nolly dear are you ready </s>
<s> 

am i to go with you </s>
<s>  asked oliver </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   i have come from bill replied the girl </s>
<s>   you are to go with
me </s>
<s> 

what for </s>
<s>  asked oliver recoiling </s>
<s> 

what for </s>
<s>  echoed the girl raising her eyes and averting them again
the moment they encountered the boys face </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   for no harm </s>
<s> 

i dont believe it said oliver </s>
<s>   who had watched her closely </s>
<s> 

have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh </s>
<s>  for no
good then </s>
<s> 

oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better
feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion
for his helpless state </s>
<s>   but then the thought darted across his mind
that it was barely eleven oclock </s>
<s>  and that many people were still in
the streets </s>
<s>   of whom surely some might be found to give credence to
his tale </s>
<s>   as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward </s>
<s>   and
said somewhat hastily that he was ready </s>
<s> 

neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his
companion </s>
<s>   she eyed him narrowly while he spoke </s>
<s>  and cast upon him a
look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what
had been passing in his thoughts </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as
she looked cautiously round </s>
<s>   you cant help yourself </s>
<s>  i have tried
hard for you but all to no purpose </s>
<s>   you are hedged round and round </s>
<s> 
if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time </s>
<s> 

struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with
great surprise </s>
<s>   she seemed to speak the truth </s>
<s>  her countenance was
white and agitated </s>
<s>  and she trembled with very earnestness </s>
<s> 

i have saved you from being illused once and i will again and i do
now continued the girl aloud </s>
<s>  for those who would have fetched you
if i had not would have been far more rough than me </s>
<s>   i have promised
for your being quiet and silent </s>
<s>  if you are not you will only do harm
to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death </s>
<s>   see here </s>
<s>   i have
borne all this for you already as true as god sees me show it </s>
<s> 

she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and arms </s>
<s>  and
continued with great rapidity </s>
<s> 

remember this </s>
<s>   and dont let me suffer more for you just now </s>
<s>  if i
could help you i would </s>
<s>  but i have not the power </s>
<s>   they dont mean to
harm you </s>
<s>  whatever they make you do is no fault of yours </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 
every word from you is a blow for me </s>
<s>   give me your hand </s>
<s>   make haste </s>
<s> 
your hand </s>
<s> 

she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and
blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs </s>
<s>  the door was
opened quickly by some one shrouded in the darkness and was as
quickly closed when they had passed out </s>
<s>   a hackneycabriolet was in
waiting </s>
<s>  with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing
oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close </s>
<s> 
the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed
without the delay of an instant </s>
<s> 

the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued to pour into
his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted </s>
<s>   all was
so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he
was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the house to
which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening </s>
<s> 

for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty
street and a cry for help hung upon his lips </s>
<s>   but the girls voice
was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her
that he had not the heart to utter it </s>
<s>  while he hesitated the
opportunity was gone </s>
<s>  he was already in the house and the door was
shut </s>
<s> 

this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time </s>
<s> 
bill </s>
<s> 

hallo </s>
<s>  replied sikes </s>
<s>  appearing at the head of the stairs with a
candle </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   thats the time of day </s>
<s>   come on </s>
<s> 

this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty
welcome from a person of <abvr> sikes temperament </s>
<s>   nancy appearing
much gratified thereby saluted him cordially </s>
<s> 

bullseyes gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them
up </s>
<s>   hed have been in the way </s>
<s> 

thats right rejoined nancy </s>
<s> 

so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room </s>
<s> 
closing the door as he spoke </s>
<s> 

yes here he is replied nancy </s>
<s> 

did he come quiet </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

like a lamb rejoined nancy </s>
<s> 

im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver </s>
<s>  for the
sake of his young carcase </s>
<s>   as would otherways have suffered for it </s>
<s> 
come here young un </s>
<s>  and let me read you a lectur which is as well
got over at once </s>
<s> 

thus addressing his new pupil <abvr> sikes pulled off olivers cap and
threw it into a corner </s>
<s>  and then taking him by the shoulder sat
himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him </s>
<s> 

now first </s>
<s>   do you know wot this is </s>
<s>  inquired sikes taking up a
pocketpistol which lay on the table </s>
<s> 

oliver replied in the affirmative </s>
<s> 

well then look here continued sikes </s>
<s>   this is powder </s>
<s>  that eres
a bullet </s>
<s>  and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin </s>
<s> 

oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and
deliberation </s>
<s> 

now its loaded said <abvr> sikes when he had finished </s>
<s> 

yes i see it is sir replied oliver </s>
<s> 

well said the robber grasping olivers wrist and putting the
barrel so close to his temple that they touched </s>
<s>  at which moment the
boy could not repress a start </s>
<s>  if you speak a word when youre out
odoors with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in
your head without notice </s>
<s>   so if you do make up your mind to speak
without leave say your prayers first </s>
<s> 

having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase
its effect <abvr> sikes continued </s>
<s> 

as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very
partickler arter you if you was disposed of </s>
<s>  so i neednt take this
devilandall of trouble to explain matters to you if it warnt for
your own good </s>
<s>   dye hear me </s>
<s> 

the short and the long of what you mean said nancy </s>
<s>   speaking very
emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his
serious attention to her words </s>
<s>   is that if youre crossed by him in
this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales
afterwards by shooting him through the head and will take your chance
of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way
of business every month of your life </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  observed <abvr> sikes approvingly </s>
<s>  women can always put
things in fewest words </s>
<s> except when its blowing up </s>
<s>  and then they
lengthens it out </s>
<s>   and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have
some supper and get a snooze before starting </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth </s>
<s> 
disappearing for a few minutes she presently returned with a pot of
porter and a dish of sheeps heads </s>
<s>  which gave occasion to several
pleasant witticisms on the part of <abvr> sikes founded upon the singular
coincidence of jemmies being a can name common to them and also to
an ingenious implement much used in his profession </s>
<s>   indeed the worthy
gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on
active service was in great spirits and good humour </s>
<s>  in proof whereof
it may be here remarked that he humourously drank all the beer at a
draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than
fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal </s>
<s> 

supper being endedit may be easily conceived that oliver had no great
appetite for itmr </s>
<s>  sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits
and water and threw himself on the bed </s>
<s>  ordering nancy with many
imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely </s>
<s>   oliver
stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on
a mattress upon the floor </s>
<s>  and the girl mending the fire sat before
it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time </s>
<s> 

for a long time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy
might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice </s>
<s>  but the
girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to
trim the light </s>
<s>   weary with watching and anxiety he at length fell
asleep </s>
<s> 

when he awoke the table was covered with teathings and sikes was
thrusting various articles into the pockets of his greatcoat which
hung over the back of a chair </s>
<s>   nancy was busily engaged in preparing
breakfast </s>
<s>   it was not yet daylight </s>
<s>  for the candle was still burning
and it was quite dark outside </s>
<s>  a sharp rain too was beating against
the windowpanes </s>
<s>  and the sky looked black and cloudy </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  growled sikes as oliver started up </s>
<s>  halfpast five </s>
<s> 
look sharp or youll get no breakfast </s>
<s>  for its late as it is </s>
<s> 

oliver was not long in making his toilet </s>
<s>  having taken some breakfast
he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite
ready </s>
<s> 

nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie
round his throat </s>
<s>  sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his
shoulders </s>
<s>   thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely
pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same
pistol in a sidepocket of his greatcoat clasped it firmly in his
and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away </s>
<s> 

oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope
of meeting a look from the girl </s>
<s>   but she had resumed her old seat in
front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it </s>

chapter xxi

the expedition

it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street </s>
<s>  blowing and
raining hard </s>
<s>  and the clouds looking dull and stormy </s>
<s>   the night had
been very wet </s>
<s>  large pools of water had collected in the road </s>
<s>  and the
kennels were overflowing </s>
<s>   there was a faint glimmering of the coming
day in the sky </s>
<s>  but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the
scene </s>
<s>   the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street
lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the
wet housetops and dreary streets </s>
<s>   there appeared to be nobody
stirring in that quarter of the town </s>
<s>  the windows of the houses were
all closely shut </s>
<s>  and the streets through which they passed were
noiseless and empty </s>
<s> 

by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had
fairly begun to break </s>
<s>   many of the lamps were already extinguished </s>
<s>  a
few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london </s>
<s>  now and
then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by </s>
<s>  the driver
bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner
who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his
arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time </s>
<s>   the
publichouses with gaslights burning inside were already open </s>
<s>   by
degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people
were met with </s>
<s>   then came straggling groups of labourers going to
their work </s>
<s>  then men and women with fishbaskets on their heads </s>
<s> 
donkeycarts laden with vegetables </s>
<s>  chaisecarts filled with livestock
or whole carcasses of meat </s>
<s>  milkwomen with pails </s>
<s>  an unbroken
concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern
suburbs of the town </s>
<s>   as they approached the city the noise and
traffic gradually increased </s>
<s>  when they threaded the streets between
shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and
bustle </s>
<s>   it was as light as it was likely to be till night came on
again and the busy morning of half the london population had begun </s>
<s> 

turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square
mr </s>
<s>  sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican </s>
<s>  thence into
long lane and so into smithfield </s>
<s>  from which latter place arose a
tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement </s>
<s> 

it was marketmorning </s>
<s>   the ground was covered nearly ankledeep with
filth and mire </s>
<s>  a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking
bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest
upon the chimneytops hung heavily above </s>
<s>   all the pens in the centre
of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into
the vacant space were filled with sheep </s>
<s>  tied up to posts by the
gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep </s>
<s> 
countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and
vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass </s>
<s>  the
whistling of drovers the barking dogs the bellowing and plunging of
the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs
the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides </s>
<s> 
the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every
publichouse </s>
<s>  the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and
yelling </s>
<s>  the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every
corner of the market </s>
<s>  and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty
figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the
throng </s>
<s>  rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite
confounded the senses </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the
thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the
numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy </s>
<s>   he nodded
twice or thrice to a passing friend </s>
<s>  and resisting as many
invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they
were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane
into holborn </s>
<s> 

now young un </s>
<s>  said sikes looking up at the clock of st </s>
<s>  andrews
church hard upon seven </s>
<s>  you must step out </s>
<s>   come dont lag behind
already lazylegs </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companions
wrist </s>
<s>  oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast
walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the housebreaker as
well as he could </s>
<s> 

they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park
corner and were on their way to kensington </s>
<s>   when sikes relaxed his
pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind
came up </s>
<s>   seeing hounslow written on it he asked the driver with as
much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far
as isleworth </s>
<s> 

jump up said the man </s>
<s>   is that your boy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting
his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was </s>
<s> 

your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my man </s>
<s> 
inquired the driver </s>
<s>  seeing that oliver was out of breath </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied sikes interposing </s>
<s>   hes used to it </s>
<s> 

here take hold of my hand ned </s>
<s>   in with you </s>
<s> 

thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart </s>
<s>  and the driver
pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest
himself </s>
<s> 

as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and
more where his companion meant to take him </s>
<s>   kensington hammersmith
chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed </s>
<s>  and yet they went on
as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey </s>
<s>   at length
they came to a publichouse called the coach and horses </s>
<s>  a little way
beyond which another road appeared to run off </s>
<s>   and here the cart
stopped </s>
<s> 

sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand
all the while </s>
<s>  and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look
upon him and rapped the sidepocket with his fist in a significant
manner </s>
<s> 

goodbye boy said the man </s>
<s> 

hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake </s>
<s>  hes sulky </s>
<s>   a young
dog </s>
<s>   dont mind him </s>
<s> 

not i </s>
<s>  rejoined the other getting into his cart </s>
<s>   its a fine day
after all </s>
<s>   and he drove away </s>
<s> 

sikes waited until he had fairly gone </s>
<s>  and then telling oliver he
might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his
journey </s>
<s> 

they turned round to the left a short way past the publichouse </s>
<s>  and
then taking a righthand road walked on for a long time </s>
<s>  passing many
large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and
stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town </s>
<s> 
here against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large
letters hampton </s>
<s>   they lingered about in the fields for some
hours </s>
<s>   at length they came back into the town </s>
<s>  and turning into an
old publichouse with a defaced signboard ordered some dinner by the
kitchen fire </s>
<s> 

the kitchen was an old lowroofed room </s>
<s>  with a great beam across the
middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the
fire </s>
<s>  on which were seated several rough men in smockfrocks drinking
and smoking </s>
<s>   they took no notice of oliver </s>
<s>  and very little of sikes </s>
<s> 
and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade
sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their
company </s>
<s> 

they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while <abvr>
sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to
feel quite certain they were not going any further </s>
<s>   being much tired
with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first </s>
<s> 
then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell
asleep </s>
<s> 

it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes </s>
<s>  rousing
himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy
in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint
of ale </s>
<s> 

so youre going on to lower halliford are you </s>
<s>  inquired sikes </s>
<s> 

yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worseor better
as the case might befor drinking </s>
<s>  and not slow about it neither </s>
<s>   my
horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in
the mornin </s>
<s>  and he wont be long adoing of it </s>
<s>   heres luck to him </s>
<s> 
ecod </s>
<s>  hes a good un </s>
<s> 

could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there </s>
<s>  demanded sikes
pushing the ale towards his new friend </s>
<s> 

if youre going directly i can replied the man looking out of the
pot </s>
<s>   are you going to halliford </s>
<s> 

going on to shepperton replied sikes </s>
<s> 

im your man as far as i go replied the other </s>
<s>   is all paid
becky </s>
<s> 

yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl </s>
<s> 

i say </s>
<s>  said the man with tipsy gravity </s>
<s>  that wont do you know </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s>  rejoined sikes </s>
<s>   youre agoing to accommodate us and
wots to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return </s>
<s> 

the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face </s>
<s> 
having done so he seized sikes by the hand </s>
<s>   and declared he was a
real good fellow </s>
<s>   to which <abvr> sikes replied he was joking </s>
<s>  as if he
had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was </s>
<s> 

after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company
goodnight and went out </s>
<s>  the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see
the party start </s>
<s> 

the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing
outside </s>
<s>   ready harnessed to the cart </s>
<s>   oliver and sikes got in without
any further ceremony </s>
<s>  and the man to whom he belonged having lingered
for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the
world to produce his equal mounted also </s>
<s>   then the hostler was told
to give the horse his head </s>

very unpleasant use of it </s>
<s>   tossing it into the air with great disdain
and running into the parlour windows over the way </s>
<s>  after performing
those feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hindlegs
he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right
gallantly </s>
<s> 

the night was very dark </s>
<s>   a damp mist rose from the river and the
marshy ground about </s>
<s>  and spread itself over the dreary fields </s>
<s>   it was
piercing cold too </s>
<s>  all was gloomy and black </s>
<s>  not a word was spoken </s>
<s> 
for the driver had grown sleepy </s>
<s>  and sikes was in no mood to lead him
into conversation </s>
<s>   oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the
cart </s>
<s>  bewildered with alarm and apprehension </s>
<s>  and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as
if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene </s>
<s> 

as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven </s>
<s>   there was a
light in the ferryhouse window opposite </s>
<s>   which streamed across the
road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yewtree with graves
beneath it </s>
<s>   there was a dull sound of falling water not far off </s>
<s>  and
the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind </s>
<s>   it seemed
like quiet music for the repose of the dead </s>
<s> 

sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road </s>
<s> 
two or three miles more and the cart stopped </s>
<s>   sikes alighted took
oliver by the hand and they once again walked on </s>
<s> 

they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected </s>
<s> 
but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes
and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the lights
of a town at no great distance </s>
<s>   on looking intently forward oliver
saw that the water was just below them and that they were coming to
the foot of a bridge </s>
<s> 

sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge </s>
<s>  then
turned suddenly down a bank upon the left </s>
<s> 

the water </s>
<s>  thought oliver turning sick with fear </s>
<s>   he has brought
me to this lonely place to murder me </s>
<s> 

he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for
his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house </s>
<s> 
all ruinous and decayed </s>
<s>   there was a window on each side of the
dilapidated entrance </s>
<s>  and one story above </s>
<s>  but no light was visible </s>
<s> 
the house was dark dismantled </s>
<s>  and the all appearance uninhabited </s>
<s> 

sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low
porch and raised the latch </s>
<s>   the door yielded to the pressure and
they passed in together </s>

chapter xxii

the burglary

hallo </s>

passage </s>

<s>  show the
gentleman in barney </s>
<s>  wake up first if convenient </s>
<s> 

the speaker appeared to throw a bootjack or some such article at the
person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers </s>
<s>   for the noise of
a wooden body falling violently was heard </s>
<s>  and then an indistinct
muttering as of a man between sleep and awake </s>
<s> 

do you hear </s>
<s>  cried the same voice </s>
<s>   theres bill sikes in the
passage with nobody to do the civil to him </s>
<s>  and you sleeping there as
if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger </s>
<s>   are you
any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you
thoroughly </s>
<s> 

a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the
room as this interrogatory was put </s>
<s>  and there issued from a door on
the right hand </s>
<s>  first a feeble candle </s>
<s>   and next the form of the same
individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at
the publichouse on saffron hill </s>
<s> 

bister sikes </s>
<s>  exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy </s>

<s>  cub id </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s>  you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him </s>
<s> 
quicker </s>
<s>  or i shall tread upon your heels </s>
<s> 

muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him </s>
<s> 
and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken
chairs a table and a very old couch </s>
<s>   on which with his legs much
higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long
clay pipe </s>
<s>   he was dressed in a smartlycut snuffcoloured coat with
large brass buttons </s>
<s>  an orange neckerchief </s>
<s>  a coarse staring
shawlpattern waistcoat </s>
<s>  and drab breeches </s>
<s>   <abvr> crackit for he it
was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face </s>
<s> 
but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew
curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers
ornamented with large common rings </s>
<s>   he was a trifle above the middle
size and apparently rather weak in the legs </s>
<s>  but this circumstance by
no means detracted from his own admiration of his topboots which he
contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction </s>
<s> 

bill my boy </s>
<s>  said this figure turning his head towards the door
im glad to see you </s>
<s>   i was almost afraid youd given it up </s>
<s>   in which
case i should have made a personal wentur </s>
<s>   hallo </s>
<s> 

uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his eyes
rested on oliver <abvr> toby crackit brought himself into a sitting
posture and demanded who that was </s>
<s> 

the boy </s>
<s>   only the boy </s>
<s>  replied sikes drawing a chair towards the
fire </s>
<s> 

wud of bister fagids lads exclaimed barney with a grin </s>
<s> 

fagins eh </s>
<s>  exclaimed toby looking at oliver </s>
<s>   wot an inwalable
boy thatll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels </s>
<s>   his mug is a
fortin to him </s>
<s> 

theretheres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently </s>
<s>  and
stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his
ear </s>
<s>   at which <abvr> crackit laughed immensely and honoured oliver with
a long stare of astonishment </s>
<s> 

now said sikes as he resumed his seat if youll give us something
to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in us </s>
<s>  or
in me at all events </s>
<s>   sit down by the fire younker and rest
yourself </s>
<s>  for youll have to go out with us again tonight though not
very far off </s>
<s> 

oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder </s>
<s>  and drawing a stool
to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarecely knowing
where he was or what was passing around him </s>
<s> 

here said toby as the young jew placed some fragments of food and
a bottle upon the table  success to the crack </s>
<s>   he rose to honour
the toast </s>
<s>  and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner
advanced to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank off its
contents </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes did the same </s>
<s> 

a drain for the boy said toby halffilling a wineglass </s>
<s>  down with
it innocence </s>
<s> 

indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face </s>
<s> 
indeed i

<s>  echoed toby </s>
<s>   do you think i dont know whats good
for you </s>
<s>   tell him to drink it bill </s>

<s>  burn my
body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers </s>
<s>   drink
it you perwerse imp </s>
<s>  drink it </s>
<s> 

frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men oliver hastily
swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a
violent fit of coughing </s>
<s>   which delighted toby crackit and barney and
even drew a smile from the surly <abvr> sikes </s>
<s> 

this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat
nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the
two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap </s>
<s>   oliver
retained his stool by the fire </s>
<s>  barney wrapped in a blanket stretched
himself on the floor </s>
<s>   close outside the fender </s>
<s> 

they slept or appeared to sleep for some time </s>
<s>  nobody stirring but
barney who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire </s>
<s>  oliver fell
into a heavy doze </s>
<s>   imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes
or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some one or other
of the scenes of the past day </s>
<s>   when he was roused by toby crackit
jumping up and declaring it was halfpast one </s>
<s> 

in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively
engaged in busy preparation </s>
<s>   sikes and his companion enveloped their
necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their greatcoats </s>
<s> 
barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he
hastily crammed into the pockets </s>
<s> 

barkers for me barney said toby crackit </s>
<s> 

here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols </s>
<s>  you
loaded them yourself </s>
<s> 

all right </s>
<s>  replied toby stowing them away </s>
<s>   the persuaders </s>
<s> 

ive got em replied sikes </s>
<s> 

crape keys centrebits darkiesnothing forgotten </s>
<s>  inquired toby </s>
<s> 
fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat </s>
<s> 

all right rejoined his companion </s>
<s>   bring them bits of timber
barney </s>
<s>   thats the time of day </s>
<s> 

with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who
having delivered another to toby busied himself in fastening on
olivers cape </s>
<s> 

now then </s>
<s>  said sikes holding out his hand </s>
<s> 

oliver </s>
<s>   who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the
air and the drink which had been forced upon him </s>
<s>   put his hand
mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose </s>
<s> 

take his other hand toby said sikes </s>
<s>   look out barney </s>
<s> 

the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet </s>
<s> 
the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them </s>
<s>  barney having
made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again </s>
<s> 

it was now intensely dark </s>
<s>   the fog was much heavier than it had been
in the early part of the night </s>
<s>  and the atmosphere was so damp that
although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes
after leaving the house had become stiff with the halffrozen moisture
that was floating about </s>
<s>   they crossed the bridge and kept on towards
the lights which he had seen before </s>
<s>   they were at no great distance
off </s>
<s>  and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey </s>
<s> 

slap through the town whispered sikes </s>
<s>  therell be nobody in the
way tonight to see us </s>
<s> 

toby acquiesced </s>
<s>  and they hurried through the main street of the little
town which at that late hour was wholly deserted </s>
<s>   a dim light shone
at intervals from some bedroom window </s>
<s>  and the hoarse barking of dogs
occasionally broke the silence of the night </s>
<s>   but there was nobody
abroad </s>
<s>   they had cleared the town as the churchbell struck two </s>
<s> 

quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left hand </s>
<s>  after
walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house
surrounded by a wall </s>
<s>   to the top of which toby crackit scarcely
pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling </s>
<s> 

the boy next said toby </s>
<s>   hoist him up </s>
<s>  ill catch hold of him </s>
<s> 

before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the
arms </s>
<s>  and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass
on the other side </s>
<s>   sikes followed directly </s>
<s>   and they stole cautiously
towards the house </s>
<s> 

and now for the first time oliver wellnigh mad with grief and
terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the
objects of the expedition </s>
<s>   he clasped his hands together and
involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror </s>
<s>   a mist came
before his eyes </s>
<s>  the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face </s>
<s>  his limbs
failed him </s>
<s>  and he sank upon his knees </s>
<s> 

get up </s>
<s>  murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol
from his pocket </s>
<s>  get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  for gods sake let me go </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>  let me run away and die
in the fields </s>
<s>   i will never come near london </s>
<s>  never never </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  pray
have mercy on me and do not make me steal </s>
<s>   for the love of all the
bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me </s>
<s> 

the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had
cocked the pistol when toby striking it from his grasp placed his
hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  cried the man </s>
<s>  it wont answer here </s>
<s>   say another word and
ill do your business myself with a crack on the head </s>
<s>   that makes no
noise and is quite as certain and more genteel </s>
<s>   here bill wrench
the shutter open </s>
<s>   hes game enough now ill engage </s>
<s>   ive seen older
hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold
night </s>
<s> 

sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagins head for sending
oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little
noise </s>
<s>   after some delay and some assistance from toby the shutter to
which he had referred swung open on its hinges </s>
<s> 

it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the
ground at the back of the house </s>
<s>   which belonged to a scullery or
small brewingplace at the end of the passage </s>
<s>   the aperture was so
small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to
defend it more securely </s>
<s>  but it was large enough to admit a boy of
olivers size nevertheless </s>
<s>   a very brief exercise of <abvr> sikes art
sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice </s>
<s>  and it soon stood
wide open also </s>
<s> 

now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern
from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face </s>
<s>  im a
going to put you through there </s>
<s>   take this light </s>
<s>  go softly up the
steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the street
door </s>
<s>  unfasten it and let us in </s>
<s> 

theres a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed
toby </s>
<s>  stand upon one of the hall chairs </s>
<s>   there are three there bill
with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on em </s>
<s>   which is
the old ladys arms </s>
<s> 

keep quiet cant you </s>
<s>  replied sikes with a threatening look </s>
<s>  the
roomdoor is open is it </s>
<s> 

wide replied toby after peeping in to satisfy himself </s>
<s>  the game of
that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog
whos got a bed in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels
wakeful </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  barney ticed him away tonight </s>
<s>   so neat </s>
<s> 

although <abvr> crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed
without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get
to work </s>
<s>   toby complied by first producing his lantern and placing it
on the ground </s>
<s>  then by planting himself firmly with his head against
the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to
make a step of his back </s>
<s>  this was no sooner done than sikes mounting
upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first </s>
<s> 
and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the
floor inside </s>
<s> 

take this lantern said sikes looking into the room </s>
<s>   you see the
stairs afore you </s>
<s> 

oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes </s>
<s>   sikes pointing to
the streetdoor with the pistolbarrel briefly advised him to take
notice that he was within shot all the way </s>
<s>  and that if he faltered he
would fall dead that instant </s>
<s> 

its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper </s>
<s>  directly
i leave go of you do your work </s>
<s>   hark </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  whispered the other man </s>
<s> 

they listened intently </s>
<s> 

nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver </s>
<s>   now </s>
<s> 

in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly
resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make one
effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family </s>
<s>   filled
with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily </s>
<s> 

come back </s>
<s>  suddenly cried sikes aloud </s>
<s>   back </s>
<s>  back </s>
<s> 

scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and
by a loud cry which followed it oliver let his lantern fall and knew
not whether to advance or fly </s>
<s> 

the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified
halfdressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa
flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere but where he knew
notand he staggered back </s>
<s> 

sikes had disappeared for an instant </s>
<s>  but he was up again and had him
by the collar before the smoke had cleared away </s>
<s>   he fired his own
pistol after the men who were already retreating </s>
<s>  and dragged the boy
up </s>
<s> 

clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the
window </s>
<s>   give me a shawl here </s>
<s>   theyve hit him </s>
<s>   quick </s>
<s>   how the boy
bleeds </s>
<s> 

then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of
firearms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried
over uneven ground at a rapid pace </s>
<s>   and then the noises grew confused
in the distance </s>
<s>  and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart </s>
<s> 
and he saw or heard no more </s>

chapter xxiii

which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between <abvr>
bumble and a lady </s>
<s>  and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on
some points

the night was bitter cold </s>
<s>   the snow lay on the ground frozen into a
hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways
and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad </s>
<s>   which
as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it
savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies
scattered it in air </s>
<s>   bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night
for the wellhoused and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god
they were at home </s>
<s>  and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him
down and die </s>
<s>   many hungerworn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may
can hardly open them in a more bitter world </s>
<s> 

such was the aspect of outofdoors affairs when <abvr> corney the
matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already
introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist sat herself down before a
cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree
of complacency at a small round table </s>
<s>   on which stood a tray of
corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most
grateful meal that matrons enjoy </s>
<s>   in fact <abvr> corney was about to
solace herself with a cup of tea </s>
<s>  as she glanced from the table to the
fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a
small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently
increasedso much so indeed that <abvr> corney smiled </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking
reflectively at the fire </s>
<s>  im sure we have all on us a great deal to
be grateful for </s>
<s>   a great deal if we did but know it </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental
blindness of those paupers who did not know it </s>
<s>  and thrusting a silver
spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a twoounce tin
teacaddy proceeded to make the tea </s>
<s> 

how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds </s>
<s>   the
black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while <abvr>
corney was moralising </s>
<s>  and the water slightly scalded <abvr> corneys
hand </s>
<s> 

drat the pot </s>
<s>  said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on
the hob </s>
<s>  a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups </s>
<s> 
what use is it of to anybody </s>
<s>   except said <abvr> corney pausing
except to a poor desolate creature like me </s>
<s>   oh dear </s>
<s> 

with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more
resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate </s>
<s>   the
small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad
recollections of <abvr> corney who had not been dead more than
fiveandtwenty years </s>
<s>  and she was overpowered </s>
<s> 

i shall never get another </s>
<s>  said <abvr> corney pettishly </s>
<s>  i shall
never get anotherlike him </s>
<s> 

whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is
uncertain </s>
<s>   it might have been the latter </s>
<s>  for <abvr> corney looked at it
as she spoke </s>
<s>  and took it up afterwards </s>
<s>   she had just tasted her first
cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the roomdoor </s>
<s> 

oh come in with you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> corney sharply </s>
<s>   some of the old
women dying i suppose </s>
<s>   they always die when im at meals </s>
<s>  dont stand
there letting the cold air in dont </s>
<s>   whats amiss now eh </s>
<s> 

nothing maam nothing replied a mans voice </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that <abvr>
bumble </s>
<s> 

at your service maam said <abvr> bumble who had been stopping
outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat </s>
<s>  and
who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
bundle in the other </s>
<s>   shall i shut the door maam </s>
<s> 

the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any
impropriety in holding an interview with <abvr> bumble with closed doors </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  bumble taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold
himself shut it without permission </s>
<s> 

hard weather <abvr> bumble said the matron </s>
<s> 

hard indeed maam replied the beadle </s>
<s>   antiporochial weather
this maam </s>
<s>   we have given away <abvr> corney we have given away a
matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very
blessed afternoon </s>
<s>  and yet them paupers are not contented </s>
<s> 

of course not </s>
<s>   when would they be <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  said the matron
sipping her tea </s>
<s> 

when indeed maam </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   why heres one man that
in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and
a good pound of cheese full weight </s>
<s>   is he grateful maam </s>
<s>   is he
grateful </s>
<s>   not a copper farthings worth of it </s>
<s>   what does he do
maam but ask for a few coals </s>
<s>  if its only a pocket handkerchief
full he says </s>
<s>   coals </s>
<s>  what would he do with coals </s>
<s>   toast his cheese
with em and then come back for more </s>
<s>   thats the way with these
people maam </s>
<s>  give em a apron full of coals today and theyll come
back for another the day after tomorrow as brazen as alabaster </s>
<s> 

the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible
simile </s>
<s>  and the beadle went on </s>
<s> 

i never said <abvr> bumble see anything like the pitch its got to </s>
<s> 
the day afore yesterday a manyou have been a married woman maam
and i may mention it to youa man with hardly a rag upon his back
here <abvr> corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door
when he has got company coming to dinner </s>
<s>  and says he must be
relieved <abvr> corney </s>
<s>   as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company
very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a
pint of oatmeal </s>
<s>   my heart </s>
<s>  says the ungrateful villain whats the
use of this to me </s>
<s>   you might as well give me a pair of iron
spectacles </s>
<s>   very good says our overseer taking em away again
you wont get anything else here </s>
<s>   then ill die in the streets </s>
<s> 
says the vagrant </s>
<s>   oh no you wont says our overseer </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   that was very good </s>
<s>   so like <abvr> grannett wasnt it </s>
<s> 
interposed the matron </s>
<s>   well <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

well maam rejoined the beadle he went away </s>
<s>  and he did die in
the streets </s>
<s>   theres a obstinate pauper for you </s>
<s> 

it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron
emphatically </s>
<s>   but dont you think outofdoor relief a very bad
thing any way <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   youre a gentleman of experience and
ought to know </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious
of superior information outofdoor relief properly managed </s>
<s> 
properly managed maam </s>
<s>  is the porochial safeguard </s>
<s>   the great
principle of outofdoor relief is to give the paupers exactly what
they dont want </s>
<s>  and then they get tired of coming </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> corney </s>
<s>   well that is a good one too </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   betwixt you and me maam returned <abvr> bumble thats the
great principle </s>
<s>  and thats the reason why if you look at any cases
that get into them owdacious newspapers youll always observe that
sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese </s>
<s>   thats the
rule now <abvr> corney all over the country </s>
<s>  but however said the
beadle stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets
maam </s>
<s>  not to be spoken of </s>
<s>  except as i may say among the porochial
officers such as ourselves </s>
<s>  this is the port wine maam that the
board ordered for the infirmary </s>
<s>  real fresh genuine port wine </s>
<s>  only
out of the cask this forenoon </s>
<s>  clear as a bell and no sediment </s>
<s> 

having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to
test its excellence <abvr> bumble placed them both on top of a chest of
drawers </s>
<s>  folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped </s>
<s>  put it
carefully in his pocket </s>

<s> 

youll have a very cold walk <abvr> bumble said the matron </s>
<s> 

it blows maam replied <abvr> bumble turning up his coatcollar
enough to cut ones ears off </s>
<s> 

the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was
moving towards the door </s>
<s>  and as the beadle coughed preparatory to
bidding her goodnight bashfully inquired whetherwhether he wouldnt
take a cup of tea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again </s>
<s>  laid his hat
and stick upon a chair </s>
<s>  and drew another chair up to the table </s>
<s>   as he
slowly seated himself he looked at the lady </s>
<s>   she fixed her eyes upon
the little teapot </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble coughed again and slightly smiled </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet </s>
<s>  as she
sat down her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle </s>
<s> 
she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea </s>
<s>   again
mr </s>
<s>  bumble coughedlouder this time than he had coughed yet </s>
<s> 

sweet </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  inquired the matron taking up the sugarbasin </s>
<s> 

very sweet indeed maam replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   he fixed his eyes on
mrs </s>
<s>  corney as he said this </s>
<s>  and if ever a beadle looked tender <abvr>
bumble was that beadle at that moment </s>
<s> 

the tea was made and handed in silence </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble having spread a
handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the
splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink </s>
<s>  varying these
amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh </s>
<s>  which however had
no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather
seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department </s>
<s> 

you have a cat maam i see said <abvr> bumble glancing at one who
in the centre of her family was basking before the fire </s>
<s>  and kittens
too i declare </s>
<s> 

i am so fond of them <abvr> bumble you cant think replied the
matron </s>
<s>   theyre so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that
they are quite companions for me </s>
<s> 

very nice animals maam replied <abvr> bumble approvingly </s>
<s>  so very
domestic </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  rejoined the matron with enthusiasm </s>
<s>  so fond of their home
too that its quite a pleasure im sure </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  corney maam said <abvr> bumble slowly and marking the time
with his teaspoon i mean to say this maam </s>
<s>  that any cat or kitten
that could live with you maam and not be fond of its home must be
a ass maam </s>
<s> 

oh <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  remonstrated <abvr> corney </s>
<s> 

its of no use disguising facts maam said <abvr> bumble slowly
flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him
doubly impressive </s>
<s>  i would drown it myself with pleasure </s>
<s> 

then youre a cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out
her hand for the beadles cup </s>
<s>  and a very hardhearted man besides </s>
<s> 

hardhearted maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   hard </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble resigned
his cup without another word </s>
<s>  squeezed <abvr> corneys little finger as
she took it </s>
<s>  and inflicting two openhanded slaps upon his laced
waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little
morsel farther from the fire </s>
<s> 

it was a round table </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> corney and <abvr> bumble had been
sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and
fronting the fire it will be seen that <abvr> bumble in receding from
the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance
between himself and <abvr> corney </s>
<s>  which proceeding some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great
heroism on <abvr> bumbles part </s>
<s>   he being in some sort tempted by time
place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft nothings
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other
great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle </s>
<s>   who as is well known should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all </s>
<s> 

whatever were <abvr> bumbles intentions however and no doubt they were
of the best </s>
<s>  it unfortunately happened as has been twice before
remarked that the table was a round one </s>
<s>  consequently <abvr> bumble
moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the
distance between himself and the matron </s>
<s>  and continuing to travel
round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close
to that in which the matron was seated </s>
<s> 

indeed the two chairs touched </s>
<s>  and when they did so <abvr> bumble
stopped </s>
<s> 

now if the matron had moved her chair to the right she would have
been scorched by the fire </s>
<s>  and if to the left she must have fallen
into <abvr> bumbles arms </s>
<s>  so being a discreet matron and no doubt
foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was
and handed <abvr> bumble another cup of tea </s>
<s> 

hardhearted <abvr> corney </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble stirring his tea and
looking up into the matrons face </s>
<s>  are you hardhearted <abvr>
corney </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a
single man </s>
<s>   what can you want to know for <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the beadle drank his tea to the last drop </s>
<s>  finished a piece of toast </s>
<s> 
whisked the crumbs off his knees </s>
<s>  wiped his lips </s>
<s>  and deliberately
kissed the matron </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>  cried that discreet lady in a whisper </s>
<s>  for the fright was
so great that she had quite lost her voice <abvr> bumble i shall
scream </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble made no reply </s>
<s>  but in a slow and dignified manner
put his arm round the matrons waist </s>
<s> 

as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would
have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was
rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door </s>
<s>   which was no
sooner heard than <abvr> bumble darted with much agility to the wine
bottles and began dusting them with great violence </s>
<s>   while the matron
sharply demanded who was there </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy
of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that
her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity </s>
<s> 

if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously
ugly </s>
<s>   putting her head in at the door old sally is agoing fast </s>
<s> 

well whats that to me </s>
<s>  angrily demanded the matron </s>
<s>   i cant keep
her alive can i </s>
<s> 

no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can </s>
<s>  shes far
beyond the reach of help </s>
<s>   ive seen a many people die </s>
<s>  little babes
and great strong men </s>
<s>  and i know when deaths acoming well enough </s>
<s> 
but shes troubled in her mind </s>
<s>  and when the fits are not on herand
thats not often for she is dying very hardshe says she has got
something to tell which you must hear </s>
<s>   shell never die quiet till
you come mistress </s>
<s> 

at this intelligence the worthy <abvr> corney muttered a variety of
invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely
annoying their betters </s>
<s>  and muffling herself in a thick shawl which
she hastily caught up briefly requested <abvr> bumble to stay till she
came back lest anything particular should occur </s>
<s>   bidding the
messenger walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs she
followed her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable </s>
<s> 
he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugartongs
closely inspected a silver milkpot to ascertain that it was of the
genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put
on his cocked hat cornerwise and danced with much gravity four
distinct times round the table </s>
<s> 

having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off
the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his
back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact
inventory of the furniture </s>
<s> 



chapter xxiv

treats on a very poor subject </s>
<s>   but is a short one and may be found of
importance in this history

it was no unfit messenger of death who had disturbed the quiet of the
matrons room </s>
<s>   her body was bent by age </s>
<s>  her limbs trembled with
palsy </s>
<s>  her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the
grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>   how few of natures faces are left alone to gladden us with
their beauty </s>
<s>   the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world
change them as they change hearts </s>
<s>  and it is only when those passions
sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass
off and leave heavens surface clear </s>
<s>   it is a common thing for the
countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to
subside into the longforgotten expression of sleeping infancy and
settle into the very look of early life </s>
<s>  so calm so peaceful do they
grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by
the coffins side in awe and see the angel even upon earth </s>
<s> 

the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering
some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion </s>
<s>  being at
length compelled to pause for breath she gave the light into her hand
and remained behind to follow as she might </s>
<s>  while the more nimble
superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay </s>
<s> 

it was a bare garretroom with a dim light burning at the farther end </s>
<s> 
there was another old woman watching by the bed </s>
<s>  the parish
apothecarys apprentice was standing by the fire making a toothpick
out of a quill </s>
<s> 

cold night <abvr> corney said this young gentleman as the matron
entered </s>
<s> 

very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil
tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke </s>
<s> 

you should get better coals out of your contractors said the
apothecarys deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker </s>
<s>  these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night </s>
<s> 

theyre the boards choosing sir returned the matron </s>
<s>  the least
they could do would be to keep us pretty warm </s>
<s>   for our places are
hard enough </s>
<s> 

the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said the young mag turning his face towards the bed as if he
had previously quite forgotten the patient its all u </s>
<s> p </s>
<s>  there <abvr>
corney </s>
<s> 

it is is it sir </s>
<s>  asked the matron </s>
<s> 

if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the
apothecarys apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point </s>
<s>  its a
breakup of the system altogether </s>
<s>   is she dozing old lady </s>
<s> 

the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain </s>
<s>  and nodded in the
affirmative </s>
<s> 

then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said
the young man </s>
<s>   put the light on the floor </s>
<s>   she wont see it there </s>
<s> 

the attendant did as she was told </s>
<s>   shaking her head meanwhile to
intimate that the woman would not die so easily </s>
<s>  having done so she
resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time
returned </s>
<s>   the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped
herself in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed </s>
<s> 

the apothecarys apprentice having completed the manufacture of the
toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
for ten minutes or so </s>
<s>   when apparently growing rather dull he wished
mrs </s>
<s>  corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe </s>
<s> 

when they had sat in silence for some time the two old women rose from
the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to
catch the heat </s>
<s>   the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled
faces and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position
they began to converse in a low voice </s>
<s> 

did she say any more anny dear while i was gone </s>
<s>  inquired the
messenger </s>
<s> 

not a word replied the other </s>
<s>   she plucked and tore at her arms for
a little time </s>
<s>  but i held her hands and she soon dropped off </s>
<s>   she
hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet </s>
<s>   i aint so
weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s> 

did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have </s>
<s>  demanded
the first </s>
<s> 

i tried to get it down rejoined the other </s>
<s>   but her teeth were
tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i
could do to get it back again </s>
<s>   so i drank it </s>
<s>  and it did me good </s>
<s> 

looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard
the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily </s>
<s> 

i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done
the same and made rare fun of it afterwards </s>
<s> 

ay that she would rejoined the other </s>
<s>  she had a merry heart </s>
<s>  a
many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as
waxwork </s>
<s>   my old eyes have seen themay and those old hands touched
them too </s>
<s>  for i have helped her scores of times </s>
<s> 

stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature
shook them exultingly before her face and fumbling in her pocket
brought out an old timediscoloured tin snuffbox from which she shook
a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few
more into her own </s>
<s>   while they were thus employed the matron who had
been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her
stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to
wait </s>
<s> 

not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her
face </s>
<s>   we have none of us long to wait for death </s>
<s>   patience patience </s>
<s> 
hell be here soon enough for us all </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue you doting idiot </s>
<s>  said the matron sternly </s>
<s>  you
martha tell me </s>
<s>  has she been in this way before </s>
<s> 

often answered the first woman </s>
<s> 

but will never be again added the second one </s>
<s>  that is shell never
wake again but onceand mind mistress that wont be for long </s>
<s> 

long or short said the matron snappishly she wont find me here
when she does wake </s>
<s>  take care both of you how you worry me again for
nothing </s>
<s>   its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house
die and i wontthats more </s>
<s>  mind that you impudent old harridans </s>
<s> 
if you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you </s>
<s> 

she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned
towards the bed caused her to look round </s>
<s>   the patient had raised
herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them </s>
<s> 

whos that </s>
<s>  she cried in a hollow voice </s>
<s> 

hush hush </s>
<s>  said one of the women stooping over her </s>
<s>   lie down lie
down </s>
<s> 

ill never lie down again alive </s>
<s>  said the woman struggling </s>
<s>  i
will tell her </s>
<s>   come here </s>
<s>   nearer </s>
<s>   let me whisper in your ear </s>
<s> 

she clutched the matron by the arm and forcing her into a chair by the
bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of
the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners </s>
<s> 

turn them away said the woman drowsily </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s> 

the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous
lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best
friends </s>
<s>  and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never
leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the
door and returned to the bedside </s>
<s>   on being excluded the old ladies
changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was
drunk </s>
<s>  which indeed was not unlikely </s>
<s>  since in addition to a
moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring
under the effects of a final taste of ginandwater which had been
privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy
old ladies themselves </s>
<s> 

now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great
effort to revive one latent spark of energy </s>
<s>   in this very roomin
this very bedi once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought
into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all
soiled with dust and blood </s>
<s>   she gave birth to a boy and died </s>
<s>   let me
thinkwhat was the year again </s>
<s> 

never mind the year said the impatient auditor </s>
<s>  what about her </s>
<s> 

ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state
what about her </s>
<s> what abouti know </s>
<s>  she cried jumping fiercely up </s>
<s> 
her face flushed and her eyes starting from her headi robbed her
so i did </s>
<s>   she wasnt coldi tell you she wasnt cold when i stole
it </s>

stole what for gods sake </s>
<s>  cried the matron with a gesture as if
she would call for help </s>
<s> 

it </s>
<s>  replied the woman laying her hand over the others mouth </s>
<s>  the
only thing she had </s>
<s>   she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to
eat </s>
<s>  but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom </s>
<s>   it was gold i
tell you </s>
<s>   rich gold that might have saved her life </s>
<s> 

gold </s>
<s>  echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell
back </s>
<s>   go on go onyeswhat of it </s>
<s>   who was the mother </s>
<s>  when was
it </s>
<s> 

she charged me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and
trusted me as the only woman about her </s>

she first showed it me hanging round her neck </s>

perhaps is on me besides </s>
<s>   they would have treated him better if they
had known it all </s>

lamb </s>

no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as
they came more faintly from the dying woman </s>
<s>   be quick or it may be
too late </s>
<s> 

the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than before </s>
<s> 
the mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in
my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come
when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
named </s>
<s>  and oh kind heaven </s>
<s>  she said folding her thin hands
together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child
abandoned to its mercy </s>
<s> 

the boys name </s>
<s>  demanded the matron </s>
<s> 

they called him oliver replied the woman feebly </s>
<s>   the gold i
stole was

yes yeswhat </s>
<s>  cried the other </s>
<s> 

she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply </s>
<s>  but drew
back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a
sitting posture </s>
<s>  then clutching the coverlid with both hands muttered
some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the bed </s>
<s> 

                              

stone dead </s>
<s>  said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the
door was opened </s>
<s> 

and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking
carelessly away </s>
<s> 

the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the
preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left
alone hovering about the body </s>
<s> 



chapter xxv

wherein this history reverts to <abvr> fagin and company

while these things were passing in the country workhouse <abvr> fagin sat
in the old denthe same from which oliver had been removed by the
girlbrooding over a dull smoky fire </s>
<s>   he held a pair of bellows upon
his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it
into more cheerful action </s>
<s>  but he had fallen into deep thought </s>
<s>  and
with his arms folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed
his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars </s>
<s> 

at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and
mr </s>
<s>  chitling </s>
<s>  all intent upon a game of whist </s>
<s>  the artful taking dummy
against master bates and <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   the countenance of the
firstnamed gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired
great additional interest from his close observance of the game and
his attentive perusal of <abvr> chitlings hand </s>
<s>  upon which from time to
time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances </s>
<s> 
wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon
his neighbours cards </s>
<s>   it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat
as indeed was often his custom within doors </s>
<s>   he also sustained a
clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space
when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot
upon the table which stood ready filled with ginandwater for the
accommodation of the company </s>
<s> 

master bates was also attentive to the play </s>
<s>  but being of a more
excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that
he more frequently applied himself to the ginandwater and moreover
indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a
scientific rubber </s>
<s>   indeed the artful presuming upon their close
attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his
companion upon these improprieties </s>
<s>  all of which remonstrances master
bates received in extremely good part </s>
<s>  merely requesting his friend to
be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some
other neatlyturned witticism of a similar kind the happy application
of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of <abvr> chitling </s>
<s> 
it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably
lost </s>
<s>  and that the circumstance so far from angering master bates
appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had
never seen such a jolly game in all his born days </s>
<s> 

thats two doubles and the rub said <abvr> chitling with a very long
face as he drew halfacrown from his waistcoatpocket </s>
<s>   i never see
such a feller as you jack </s>
<s>  you win everything </s>
<s>   even when weve good
cards charley and i cant make nothing of em </s>
<s> 

either the master or the manner of this remark which was made very
ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of
laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire
what was the matter </s>
<s> 

matter fagin </s>
<s>  cried charley </s>
<s>   i wish you had watched the play </s>
<s> 
tommy chitling hasnt won a point </s>
<s>  and i went partners with him against
the artfull and dumb </s>
<s> 

ay ay </s>
<s>  said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated
that he was at no loss to understand the reason </s>
<s>  try em again tom </s>
<s> 
try em again </s>
<s> 

no more of it for me thank ee fagin replied <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>  ive
had enough </s>
<s>   that ere dodger has such a run of luck that theres no
standing again him </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  my dear replied the jew you must get up very early in the
morning to win against the dodger </s>
<s> 

morning </s>
<s>  said charley bates </s>
<s>  you must put your boots on overnight
and have a telescope at each eye and a operaglass between your
shoulders if you want to come over him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy
and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first
picturecard at a shilling at a time </s>
<s>   nobody accepting the challenge
and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to amuse
himself by sketching a groundplan of newgate on the table with the
piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters </s>
<s>  whistling
meantime with peculiar shrillness </s>
<s> 

how precious dull you are tommy </s>
<s>  said the dodger stopping short
when there had been a long silence </s>
<s>  and addressing <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   what
do you think hes thinking of fagin </s>
<s> 

how should i know my dear </s>
<s>  replied the jew looking round as he
plied the bellows </s>
<s>   about his losses maybe </s>
<s>  or the little retirement
in the country that hes just left eh </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>   is that it my dear </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of
discourse as <abvr> chitling was about to reply </s>
<s>   what do you say
charley </s>
<s> 

i should say replied master bates with a grin that he was
uncommon sweet upon betsy </s>
<s>   see how hes ablushing </s>
<s>   oh my eye </s>
<s> 
heres a merrygorounder </s>
<s>   tommy chitlings in love </s>
<s>   oh fagin
fagin </s>
<s>  what a spree </s>
<s> 

thoroughly overpowered with the notion of <abvr> chitling being the victim
of the tender passion master bates threw himself back in his chair
with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the
floor </s>
<s>  where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at
full length until his laugh was over when he resumed his former
position and began another laugh </s>
<s> 

never mind him my dear said the jew winking at <abvr> dawkins and
giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows </s>
<s> 
betsys a fine girl </s>
<s>   stick up to her tom </s>
<s>   stick up to her </s>
<s> 

what i mean to say fagin replied <abvr> chitling very red in the

the jew perceiving that <abvr> chitling was considerably roused hastened
to assure him that nobody was laughing </s>
<s>  and to prove the gravity of the
company appealed to master bates the principal offender </s>
<s>   but
unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never
more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a
violent roar that the abused <abvr> chitling without any preliminary
ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender </s>
<s> 
who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose
his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood
panting for breath while <abvr> chitling looked on in intense dismay </s>
<s> 

hark </s>
<s>  cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler </s>
<s> 
catching up the light he crept softly upstairs </s>
<s> 

the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in
darkness </s>
<s>   after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered
fagin mysteriously </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the jew alone </s>
<s> 

the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the
candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb
show that he had better not be funny just then </s>
<s>   having performed this
friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his
directions </s>
<s> 

the old man bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds </s>
<s>  his
face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and
feared to know the worst </s>
<s>   at length he raised his head </s>
<s> 

where is he </s>
<s>  he asked </s>
<s> 

the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to
leave the room </s>
<s> 

yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry </s>
<s>  bring him down </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 
quiet charley </s>
<s>   gently tom </s>
<s>   scarce scarce </s>
<s> 

this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist was
softly and immediately obeyed </s>
<s>   there was no sound of their whereabout
when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand
and followed by a man in a coarse smockfrock </s>
<s>  who after casting a
hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had
concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosed </s>
<s>  all haggard
unwashed and unshorn </s>
<s>  the features of flash toby crackit </s>
<s> 

how are you faguey </s>
<s>  said this worthy nodding to the jew </s>
<s>  pop that
shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it
when i cut </s>
<s>  thats the time of day </s>
<s>   youll be a fine young cracksman
afore the old file now </s>
<s> 

with these words he pulled up the smockfrock </s>
<s>  and winding it round
his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob </s>
<s> 

see there faguey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots </s>
<s> 
not a drop of day and martin since you know when </s>
<s>  not a bubble of
blacking by jove </s>
<s>    but dont look at me in that way man </s>
<s>   all in
good time </s>
<s>   i cant talk about business till ive eat and drank </s>
<s>  so
produce the sustainance and lets have a quiet fillout for the first
time these three days </s>
<s> 

the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon
the table </s>
<s>  and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his
leisure </s>
<s> 

to judge from appearances toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
conversation </s>
<s>   at first the jew contented himself with patiently
watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue
to the intelligence he brought </s>
<s>  but in vain </s>
<s> 

he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon
his features that they always wore </s>
<s>   and through dirt and beard and
whisker there still shone unimpaired the selfsatisfied smirk of
flash toby crackit </s>
<s>  then the jew in an agony of impatience watched
every morsel he put into his mouth </s>
<s>  pacing up and down the room
meanwhile in irrepressible excitement </s>
<s>   it was all of no use </s>
<s>   toby
continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could
eat no more </s>
<s>  then ordering the dodger out he closed the door mixed a
glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking </s>
<s> 

first and foremost faguey said toby </s>
<s> 

yes yes </s>
<s>  interposed the jew drawing up his chair </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to
declare that the gin was excellent </s>
<s>  then placing his feet against the
low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his
eye he quietly resumed </s>
<s> 

first and foremost faguey said the housebreaker hows bill </s>

why you dont mean to say began toby turning pale </s>

pointing to it </s>

they fired and hit the boy </s>

him between usstraight as the crow fliesthrough hedge and ditch </s>

they gave chase </s>

us </s>

the boy </s>

bill had him on his back and scudded like the wind </s>

we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch </s>

his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house </s>

chapter xxvi

in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene </s>
<s>  and many
things inseparable from this history are done and performed

the old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover
the effect of toby crackits intelligence </s>
<s>   he had relaxed nothing of
his unusual speed </s>
<s>  but was still pressing onward in the same wild and
disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage </s>
<s>  and a
boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger </s>
<s>   drove him
back upon the pavement </s>
<s>   avoiding as much as was possible all the
main streets and skulking only through the byways and alleys he at
length emerged on snow hill </s>
<s>   here he walked even faster than before </s>
<s> 
nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court </s>
<s>  when as if
conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual
shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely </s>
<s> 

near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon
the right hand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley
leading to saffron hill </s>
<s>   in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns </s>
<s> 
for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets </s>
<s> 
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the
windows or flaunting from the doorposts </s>
<s>  and the shelves within are
piled with them </s>
<s>  confined as the limits of field lane are it has its
barber its coffeeshop its beershop and its friedfish warehouse </s>
<s> 
it is a commercial colony of itself </s>
<s>   the emporium of petty larceny </s>
<s> 
visited at early morning and settingin of dusk by silent merchants
who traffic in dark backparlours and who go as strangely as they
come </s>
<s>   here the clothesman the shoevamper and the ragmerchant
display their goods as signboards to the petty thief </s>
<s>  here stores of
old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollenstuff and
linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars </s>
<s> 

it was into this place that the jew turned </s>
<s>   he was well known to the
sallow denizens of the lane </s>
<s>  for such of them as were on the lookout
to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along </s>
<s>  he replied to
their salutations in the same way </s>
<s>  but bestowed no closer recognition
until he reached the further end of the alley </s>
<s>  when he stopped to
address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his
person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a
pipe at his warehouse door </s>
<s> 

why the sight of you <abvr> fagin would cure the hoptalmy </s>
<s>  said this
respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his
health </s>
<s> 

the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating
his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders </s>
<s> 

well ive heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied
the trader </s>
<s>  but it soon cools down again </s>
<s>  dont you find it so </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded in the affirmative </s>
<s>   pointing in the direction of saffron
hill he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight </s>
<s> 

at the cripples </s>
<s>  inquired the man </s>
<s> 

the jew nodded </s>
<s> 

let me see pursued the merchant reflecting </s>
<s> 

yes theres some halfdozen of em gone in that i knows </s>
<s>  i dont
think your friends there </s>
<s> 

sikes is not i suppose </s>
<s>  inquired the jew with a disappointed
countenance </s>
<s> 

non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking
his head and looking amazingly sly </s>
<s>   have you got anything in my line
tonight </s>
<s> 

nothing tonight said the jew turning away </s>
<s> 

are you going up to the cripples fagin </s>
<s>  cried the little man
calling after him </s>
<s>   stop </s>
<s>   i dont mind if i have a drop there with
you </s>
<s> 

but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he
preferred being alone </s>
<s>  and moreover as the little man could not very
easily disengage himself from the chair </s>
<s>  the sign of the cripples was
for a time bereft of the advantage of <abvr> livelys presence </s>
<s>   by the
time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared </s>
<s>  so <abvr> lively
after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight
of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a
shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and
mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour </s>
<s> 

the three cripples or rather the cripples </s>
<s>  which was the sign by which
the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons </s>
<s>   was the
publichouse in which <abvr> sikes and his dog have already figured </s>
<s> 
merely making a sign to a man at the bar fagin walked straight
upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating
himself into the chamber looked anxiously about </s>
<s>  shading his eyes with
his hand as if in search of some particular person </s>
<s> 

the room was illuminated by two gaslights </s>
<s>  the glare of which was
prevented by the barred shutters and closelydrawn curtains of faded
red from being visible outside </s>
<s>   the ceiling was blackened to prevent
its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps </s>
<s>  and the
place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely
possible to discern anything more </s>
<s>   by degrees however as some of it
cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused
as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out </s>
<s>  and as the eye
grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware
of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a
long table </s>
<s>  at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of
office in his hand </s>
<s>  while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose
and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a
jingling piano in a remote corner </s>
<s> 

as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over
the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a
song </s>
<s>  which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the
company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the
accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could </s>
<s>   when
this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the
professional gentleman on the chairmans right and left volunteered a
duet and sang it with great applause </s>
<s> 

it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
among the group </s>
<s>   there was the chairman himself the landlord of the
house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were
proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give
himself up to joviality had an eye for everything that was done and
an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones too </s>
<s>   near him
were the singers </s>
<s>  receiving with professional indifference the
compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a
dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more
boisterous admirers </s>
<s>  whose countenances expressive of almost every
vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by
their very repulsiveness </s>
<s>   cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its
stages were there in their strongest aspect </s>
<s>  and women </s>
<s>  some with the
last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you
looked </s>
<s>   others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten
out and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime </s>
<s> 
some mere girls others but young women and none past the prime of
life </s>
<s>  formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture </s>
<s> 

fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face
while these proceedings were in progress </s>
<s>  but apparently without
meeting that of which he was in search </s>
<s>  succeeding at length in
catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him
slightly and left the room as quietly as he had entered it </s>
<s> 

what can i do for you <abvr> fagin </s>
<s>  inquired the man as he followed
him out to the landing </s>
<s>   wont you join us </s>
<s>   theyll be delighted
every one of em </s>
<s> 

the jew shook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he
here </s>
<s> 

no replied the man </s>
<s> 

and no news of barney </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s> 

none replied the landlord of the cripples </s>
<s>  for it was he </s>
<s>  he wont
stir till its all safe </s>
<s>   depend on it theyre on the scent down
there </s>
<s>  and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once </s>
<s>   hes
all right enough barney is else i should have heard of him </s>
<s>   ill
pound it that barneys managing properly </s>
<s>  let him alone for that </s>
<s> 

will he be here tonight </s>
<s>  asked the jew laying the same emphasis
on the pronoun as before </s>
<s> 

monks do you mean </s>
<s>  inquired the landlord hesitating </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said the jew </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob </s>
<s>  i
expected him here before now </s>
<s>   if youll wait ten minutes hell be

no no said the jew hastily </s>
<s>  as though however desirous he might
be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence </s>
<s>   tell him i came here to see him </s>
<s>  and that he must come to me
tonight </s>
<s>   no say tomorrow </s>
<s>   as he is not here tomorrow will be
time enough </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s>   nothing more </s>
<s> 

not a word now said the jew descending the stairs </s>
<s> 

i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a
hoarse whisper </s>
<s>  what a time this would be for a sell </s>
<s>   ive got phil
barker here </s>
<s>  so drunk that a boy might take him </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up </s>
<s> 

phil has something more to do before we can afford to part with him </s>
<s> 
so go back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry
liveswhile they last </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh </s>
<s>  and returned to his
guests </s>
<s>   the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its
former expression of anxiety and thought </s>
<s>   after a brief reflection he
called a hackcabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green </s>
<s> 
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of <abvr> sikess
residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot </s>
<s> 

now muttered the jew as he knocked at the door if there is any
deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you
are </s>
<s> 

she was in her room the woman said </s>
<s>   fagin crept softly upstairs and
entered it without any previous ceremony </s>
<s>   the girl was alone </s>
<s>  lying
with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it </s>
<s> 

she has been drinking thought the jew cooly or perhaps she is
only miserable </s>
<s> 

the old man turned to close the door as he made this reflection </s>
<s>  the
noise thus occasioned roused the girl </s>
<s>   she eyed his crafty face
narrowly as she inquired to his recital of toby crackits story </s>
<s>   when
it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a
word </s>
<s>   she pushed the candle impatiently away </s>
<s>  and once or twice as she
feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground </s>
<s>  but
this was all </s>
<s> 

during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to
assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly
returned </s>
<s>   apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice
or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation </s>
<s>  but the
girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone </s>
<s>   at length
he made another attempt </s>
<s>  and rubbing his hands together said in his
most conciliatory tone

and where should you think bill was now my dear </s>
<s> 

the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not
tell </s>
<s>  and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be
crying </s>
<s> 

and the boy too said the jew straining his eyes to catch a glimpse
of her face </s>
<s>   poor leetle child </s>
<s>   left in a ditch nance </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s> 

the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he
is than among us </s>
<s>  and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies
dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the jew in amazement </s>
<s> 

ay i do returned the girl meeting his gaze </s>
<s>   i shall be glad to
have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over </s>
<s>   i
cant bear to have him about me </s>
<s>   the sight of him turns me against
myself and all of you </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said the jew scornfully </s>
<s>   youre drunk </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s>  cried the girl bitterly </s>
<s>   its no fault of yours if i am not </s>
<s> 
youd never have me anything else if you had your will except
now </s>
<s> the humour doesnt suit you doesnt it </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  rejoined the jew furiously </s>
<s>   it does not </s>
<s> 

change it then </s>
<s>  responded the girl with a laugh </s>
<s> 

change it </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his
companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i
will change it </s>
<s>   listen to me you drab </s>
<s>   listen to me who with six
words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat
between my fingers now </s>
<s>   if he comes back and leaves the boy behind
him </s>
<s>  if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to
me </s>
<s>  murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch </s>
<s>   and
do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too
late </s>
<s> 

what is all this </s>
<s>  cried the girl involuntarily </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  pursued fagin mad with rage </s>
<s>   when the boys worth
hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way
of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could
whistle away the lives of </s>
<s>   and me bound too to a born devil that
only wants the will and has the power to to

panting for breath the old man stammered for a word </s>
<s>  and in that
instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole
demeanour </s>
<s>   a moment before his clenched hands had grasped the air </s>
<s> 
his eyes had dilated </s>
<s>  and his face grown livid with passion </s>
<s>  but now
he shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the
apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy </s>
<s>   after a
short silence he ventured to look round at his companion </s>
<s>   he appeared
somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from
which he had first roused her </s>
<s> 

nancy dear </s>
<s>  croaked the jew in his usual voice </s>
<s>   did you mind me
dear </s>
<s> 

dont worry me now fagin </s>
<s>  replied the girl raising her head
languidly </s>
<s>   if bill has not done it this time he will another </s>
<s>  he has
done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can </s>
<s>  and
when he cant he wont </s>
<s>  so no more about that </s>
<s> 

regarding this boy my dear </s>
<s>  said the jew rubbing the palms of his
hands nervously together </s>
<s> 

the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy
hastily </s>
<s>  and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way
and out of yoursthat is if bill comes to no harm </s>
<s>   and if toby got
clear off bills pretty sure to be safe </s>
<s>  for bills worth two of toby
any time </s>
<s> 

and about what i was saying my dear </s>
<s>  observed the jew keeping his
glistening eye steadily upon her </s>
<s> 

you must say it all over again if its anything you want me to do
rejoined nancy </s>
<s>  and if it is you had better wait till tomorrow </s>
<s>   you
put me up for a minute </s>
<s>  but now im stupid again </s>
<s> 

fagin put several other questions </s>
<s>  all with the same drift of
ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints </s>
<s>  but
she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his
searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a
trifle in liquor was confirmed </s>
<s>   nancy indeed was not exempt from a
failing which was very common among the jews female pupils </s>
<s>  and in
which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than
checked </s>
<s>  her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva
which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of
the justice of the jews supposition </s>
<s>  and when after indulging in the
temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into
dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings </s>
<s>  under the
influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave
utterance to various exclamations of never say die </s>
<s>  and divers
calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a
lady or gentleman was happy <abvr> fagin who had had considerable
experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction
that she was very far gone indeed </s>
<s> 

having eased his mind by this discovery </s>
<s>  and having accomplished his
twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard
and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned
mr </s>
<s>  fagin again turned his face homeward </s>
<s>  leaving his young friend
asleep with her head upon the table </s>
<s> 

it was within an hour of midnight </s>
<s>   the weather being dark and
piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter </s>
<s>   the sharp wind
that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as
of dust and mud for few people were abroad and they were to all
appearance hastening fast home </s>
<s>  it blew from the right quarter for the
jew however and straight before it he went </s>
<s>  trembling and shivering
as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way </s>
<s> 

he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling
in his pocket for the doorkey when a dark figure emerged from a
projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road
glided up to him unperceived </s>
<s> 

fagin </s>
<s>  whispered a voice close to his ear </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the jew turning quickly round is that

yes </s>
<s>  interrupted the stranger </s>
<s>   i have been lingering here these two
hours </s>
<s>   where the devil have you been </s>
<s> 

on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily at his
companion and slackening his pace as he spoke </s>
<s>   on your business all
night </s>
<s> 

oh of course </s>
<s>  said the stranger with a sneer </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  and whats
come of it </s>
<s> 

nothing good said the jew </s>
<s> 

nothing bad i hope </s>
<s>  said the stranger stopping short and turning a
startled look on his companion </s>
<s> 

the jew shook his head and was about to reply when the stranger
interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this
time arrived </s>
<s>   remarking that he had better say what he had got to
say under cover </s>
<s>   for his blood was chilled with standing about so
long and the wind blew through him </s>
<s> 

fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking
home a visitor at that unseasonable hour </s>
<s>  and indeed muttered
something about having no fire </s>
<s>  but his companion repeating his request
in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to
close it softly while he got a light </s>
<s> 

its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps </s>
<s> 
make haste </s>
<s> 

shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage </s>
<s>  as he
spoke it closed with a loud noise </s>
<s> 

that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way </s>
<s>  the wind
blew it to or it shut of its own accord </s>
<s>  one or the other </s>
<s>  look sharp
with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in
this confounded hole </s>
<s> 

fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs </s>
<s>   after a short absence
he returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that toby
crackit was asleep in the back room below and that the boys were in
the front one </s>
<s>   beckoning the man to follow him he led the way
upstairs </s>
<s> 

we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the
jew throwing open a door on the first floor </s>
<s>  and as there are holes
in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours well set
the candle on the stairs </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s> 

with those words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper
flight of stairs exactly opposite to the room door </s>
<s>   this done he led
the way into the apartment </s>
<s>  which was destitute of all movables save a
broken armchair and an old couch or sofa without covering which
stood behind the door </s>
<s>   upon this piece of furniture the stranger sat
himself with the air of a weary man </s>
<s>  and the jew drawing up the
armchair opposite they sat face to face </s>
<s>   it was not quite dark </s>
<s>  the
door was partially open </s>
<s>  and the candle outside threw a feeble
reflection on the opposite wall </s>
<s> 

they conversed for some time in whispers </s>
<s>   though nothing of the
conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be
defending himself against some remarks of the stranger </s>
<s>  and that the
latter was in a state of considerable irritation </s>
<s>   they might have been
talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monksby which
name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course
of their colloquysaid raising his voice a little

i tell you again it was badly planned </s>
<s>   why not have kept him here
among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at

<s> 

why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen </s>
<s> 
demanded monks sternly </s>
<s>   havent you done it with other boys scores
of times </s>
<s>   if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt
you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom </s>
<s>  perhaps
for life </s>
<s> 

whose turn would that have served my dear </s>
<s>  inquired the jew humbly </s>
<s> 

mine replied monks </s>
<s> 

but not mine said the jew submissively </s>
<s>   he might have become of
use to me </s>
<s>   when there are two parties to a bargain it is only
reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted </s>
<s>  is it my
good friend </s>
<s> 

what then </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew </s>
<s> 
he was not like other boys in the same circumstances </s>
<s> 

curse him no </s>
<s>  muttered the man or he would have been a thief long
ago </s>
<s> 

i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously
watching the countenance of his companion </s>
<s>   his hand was not in </s>
<s>   i
had nothing to frighten him with </s>
<s>  which we always must have in the
beginning or we labour in vain </s>
<s>   what could i do </s>
<s>   send him out with
the dodger and charley </s>
<s>   we had enough of that at first my dear </s>
<s>  i
trembled for us all </s>
<s> 

that was not my doing observed monks </s>
<s> 

no no my dear </s>
<s>  renewed the jew </s>
<s>   and i dont quarrel with it now </s>
<s> 
because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on
the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you
were looking for </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>   i got him back for you by means of the girl </s>
<s> 
and then she begins to favour him </s>
<s> 

throttle the girl </s>
<s>  said monks impatiently </s>
<s> 

why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew
smiling </s>
<s>  and besides that sort of thing is not in our way </s>
<s>  or one
of these days i might be glad to have it done </s>
<s>   i know what these
girls are monks well </s>
<s>   as soon as the boy begins to harden shell
care no more for him than for a block of wood </s>
<s>   you want him made a
thief </s>
<s>   if he is alive i can make him one from this time </s>

ifif said the jew drawing nearer to the otherits not likely

its no fault of mine if he is </s>
<s>  interposed the other man with a look
of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands </s>
<s>   mind
that </s>
<s>   fagin </s>
<s>   i had no hand in it </s>
<s>   anything but his death i told you
from the first </s>
<s>   i wont shed blood </s>

a man besides </s>

me </s>

what </s>
<s>  cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both
arms as he sprung to his feet </s>
<s>   where </s>
<s> 

yonder </s>
<s>  replied the man glaring at the opposite wall </s>
<s>   the shadow </s>
<s> 
i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the
wainscot like a breath </s>
<s> 

the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the room </s>
<s> 
the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been
placed </s>
<s>   it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white
faces </s>
<s>   they listened intently </s>
<s>   a profound silence reigned throughout
the house </s>
<s> 

its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his
companion </s>
<s> 

ill swear i saw it </s>
<s>  replied monks trembling </s>
<s>   it was bending
forward when i saw it first </s>
<s>  and when i spoke it darted away </s>
<s> 

the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate and
telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs </s>
<s>   they
looked into all the rooms </s>
<s>  they were cold bare and empty </s>
<s>   they
descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below </s>
<s>   the
green damp hung upon the low walls </s>
<s>  the tracks of the snail and slug
glistened in the light of the candle </s>
<s>  but all was still as death </s>
<s> 

what do you think now </s>
<s>  said the jew when they had regained the
passage </s>
<s>   besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house
except toby and the boys </s>
<s>  and theyre safe enough </s>
<s>  see here </s>
<s> 

as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket </s>
<s> 
and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them
in to prevent any intrusion on the conference </s>
<s> 

this accumulated testimony effectually staggered <abvr> monks </s>
<s>  his
protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
proceeded in their search without making any discovery </s>
<s>  and now he
gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have
been his excited imagination </s>
<s>   he declined any renewal of the
conversation however for that night </s>
<s>   suddenly remembering that it
was past one oclock </s>
<s>   and so the amiable couple parted </s>

chapter xxvii

atones for the unpoliteness of a former </s>
<s> </s>
<s>  which deserted a lady
most unceremoniously

as it would be by no means seemly in a humble author to keep so
mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and
the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as
it might suit his pleasure to relieve him </s>
<s>  and as it would still less
become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming
from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of
whatsoever degree </s>

delegatedhastens to pay them that respect which their position
demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their
exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at
his hands </s>
<s>   towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in
this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and
elucidative of the position that a beadle can do no wrong </s>
<s>   which
could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
rightminded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of
time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
opportunity </s>
<s>  on the arrival of which he will be prepared to show that
a beadle properly constituted </s>
<s>   that is to say a parochial beadle
attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official
capacity the parochial church </s>

possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity </s>

that to none of those excellences can mere companies beadles or

the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horsehair seats
of the chairs </s>

<s> 
before he began to think that it was time for <abvr> corney to return </s>
<s> 
thinking begets thinking </s>
<s>  as there were no sounds of <abvr> corneys
approach it occured to <abvr> bumble that it would be an innocent and
virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his
curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of <abvr> corneys chest
of drawers </s>
<s> 

having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was
approaching the chamber <abvr> bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded
to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers </s>
<s> 
which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture
carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with
dried lavender </s>
<s>  seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction </s>
<s>   arriving
in course of time at the righthand corner drawer in which was the
key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken
gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin <abvr> bumble
returned with a stately walk to the fireplace </s>
<s>  and resuming his old
attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do it </s>
<s>  he
followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a
waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were remonstrating with
himself for being such a pleasant dog </s>
<s>  and then he took a view of his
legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest </s>
<s> 

he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when <abvr> corney
hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a
chair by the fireside and covering her eyes with one hand placed the
other over her heart and gasped for breath </s>

lady pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion

a pint greenglass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated
filled a teacup with its contents and held it to the ladys lips </s>

im better now said <abvr> corney falling back after drinking half
of it </s>

mr </s>

on the beadle as she spoke </s>

something else in it </s>

mr </s>

its very comforting said <abvr> corney </s>

very much so indeed maam said the beadle </s>

chair beside the matron and tenderly inquired what had happened to

nothing replied <abvr> corney </s>

closer </s>

we are all weak creeturs said <abvr> corney laying down a general
principle </s>

so we are said the beadle </s>

nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards </s>
<s>  by the
expiration of that time <abvr> bumble had illustrated the position by
removing his left arm from the back of <abvr> corneys chair where it

coals candles and houserent free said <abvr> bumble </s>

the lady was not proof against this burst of feeling </s>

mrs </s>

summoning up courage she threw her arms around <abvr> bumbles neck and
said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a
irresistible duck </s>
<s> 

matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract
was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture </s>
<s> 
which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of
the ladys spirits </s>

bumble with the old womans decease </s>

very good said that gentleman sipping his peppermint </s>

it wasnt anything particular dear said the lady evasively </s>

it must have been something love urged <abvr> bumble </s>

your own b </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

not now rejoined the lady </s>
<s>  one of these days </s>
<s>   after were married
dear </s>

after were married </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   it wasnt any impudence
from any of them male paupers as

no no love </s>

if i thought it was continued <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  if i thought as any one
of em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance

they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the lady </s>

they had better not </s>

<s>  let me see
any man porochial or extraporochial as would presume to do it </s>
<s>  and i
can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second time </s>
<s> 

unembellished by any violence of gesticulation this might have seemed
no very high compliment to the ladys charms </s>
<s>  but as <abvr> bumble
accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched
with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration
that he was indeed a dove </s>
<s> 

the dove then turned up his coatcollar and put on his cocked hat </s>
<s> 
and having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future
partner once again braved the cold wind of the night </s>
<s>  merely pausing
for a few minutes in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little
with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of
workhousemaster with needful acerbity </s>
<s>  assured of his qualifications
mr </s>
<s>  bumble left the building with a light heart and bright visions of
his future promotion </s>
<s>   which served to occupy his mind until he reached
the shop of the undertaker </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> and <abvr> sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper </s>
<s>  and
noah claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a
greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient
performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was
not closed although it was past the usual hour of shuttingup </s>
<s>   <abvr>
bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times </s>
<s>  but
attracting no attention and beholding a light shining through the
glasswindow of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made
bold to peep in and see what was going forward </s>
<s>  and when he saw what
was going forward he was not a little surprised </s>
<s> 

the cloth was laid for supper </s>
<s>  the table was covered with bread and
butter plates and glasses </s>
<s>  a porterpot and a winebottle </s>
<s>  at the
upper end of the table <abvr> noah claypole lolled negligently in an
easychair with his legs thrown over one of the arms </s>
<s>  an open
claspknife in one hand and a mass of buttered bread in the other </s>
<s> 
close beside him stood charlotte opening oysters from a barrel </s>
<s>  which
mr </s>
<s>  claypole condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity </s>
<s>   a more
than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and
a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in a slight
degree intoxicated </s>
<s>  these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish
with which he took his oysters for which nothing but a strong
appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever
could have sufficiently accounted </s>
<s> 

heres a delicious fat one noah dear </s>
<s>  said charlotte </s>
<s>  try him do </s>
<s> 
only this one </s>
<s> 

what a delicious thing is a oyster </s>
<s>  remarked <abvr> claypole after he
had swallowed it </s>
<s>   what a pity it is a number of em should ever make
you feel uncomfortable </s>
<s>  isnt it charlotte </s>

its quite a cruelty said charlotte </s>

so it is acquiesced <abvr> claypole </s>

<s>   say that again sir </s>
<s> 

charlotte uttered a scream and hid her face in her apron </s>
<s>   <abvr>
claypole without making any further change in his position than
suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken
terror </s>
<s>

you mention such a thing sir </s>

beadle strode with a lofty and gloomy air from the undertakers
premises </s>

and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have
made all necessary preparations for the old womans funeral let us set
on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist and ascertain whether

<s>  i wish

<s>  youd howl the hoarser for it </s>
<s> 

as sikes growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate
ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body
of the wounded boy across his bended knee </s>
<s>  and turned his head for an
instant to look back at his pursuers </s>
<s> 

there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness </s>
<s>  but the loud
shouting of men vibrated through the air and the barking of the
neighbouring dogs roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in
every direction </s>
<s> 

stop you whitelivered hound </s>
<s>  cried the robber shouting after toby
crackit who making the best use of his long legs was already ahead </s>
<s> 
stop </s>
<s> 

the repetition of the word brought toby to a dead standstill </s>
<s>  for he
was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistolshot </s>

bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his
confederate </s>

toby made a show of returning </s>

want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly
along </s>

quicker </s>

drawing a pistol from his pocket </s>
<s>   dont play booty with me </s>
<s> 

at this moment the noise grew louder </s>
<s>   sikes again looking round
could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing
the gate of the field in which he stood </s>
<s>  and that a couple of dogs were
some paces in advance of them </s>
<s> 

its all up bill </s>
<s>  cried toby </s>
<s>  drop the kid and show em your
heels </s>
<s>   with this parting advice <abvr> crackit preferring the chance
of being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his
enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed </s>
<s>   sikes
clenched his teeth </s>
<s>  took one look around </s>
<s>  threw over the prostrate form
of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled </s>
<s>  ran along
the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those
behind from the spot where the boy lay </s>
<s>  paused for a second before
another hedge which met it at right angles </s>
<s>  and whirling his pistol
high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone </s>
<s> 

ho ho there </s>
<s>  cried a tremulous voice in the rear </s>
<s>  pincher </s>
<s> 
neptune </s>
<s>   come here come here </s>
<s> 

the dogs who in common with their masters seemed to have no
particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily
answered to the command </s>
<s>   three men who had by this time advanced some
distance into the field stopped to take counsel together </s>
<s> 

my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the
fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again </s>
<s> 

i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to <abvr> giles said a
shorter man </s>
<s>  who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very
pale in the face and very polite </s>
<s>  as frightened men frequently are </s>
<s> 

i shouldnt wish to appear illmannered gentlemen said the third
who had called the dogs back <abvr> giles ought to know </s>
<s> 

certainly replied the shorter man </s>
<s>  and whatever <abvr> giles says it
isnt our place to contradict him </s>
<s>   no no i know my sitiwation </s>
<s> 
thank my stars i know my sitiwation </s>
<s>   to tell the truth the little
man did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that
it was by no means a desirable one </s>

you are afraid brittles said <abvr> giles </s>

i ant said brittles </s>
<s> 

you are said giles </s>
<s> 

youre a falsehood <abvr> giles said brittles </s>
<s> 

youre a lie brittles said <abvr> giles </s>
<s> 

now these four retorts arose from <abvr> giless taunt </s>
<s>  and <abvr> giless
taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of
going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment </s>
<s> 
the third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid </s>
<s> 

speak for yourself sir said <abvr> giles who was the palest of the
party </s>
<s> 

so i do replied the man </s>

under such circumstances </s>
<s>   i am </s>
<s> 

so am i said brittles </s>
<s>  only theres no call to tell a man he is so
bounceably </s>
<s> 

these frank admissions softened <abvr> giles who at once owned that he
was afraid </s>
<s>  upon which they all three faced about and ran back again
with the completest unanimity until <abvr> giles who had the shortest
wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely
insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech </s>
<s> 

but its wonderful said <abvr> giles when he had explained what a
man will do when his blood is up </s>

as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment </s>

their blood like his had all gone down again </s>
<s>  some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament </s>
<s> 

i know what it was said <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  it was the gate </s>

i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the
idea </s>

you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow
of the excitement </s>
<s>   i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was
climbing over it </s>
<s> 

by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the
same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment </s>
<s>   it was quite
obvious therefore that it was the gate </s>
<s>  especially as there was no
doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because
all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the
instant of its occurance </s>
<s> 

this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse
and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in
the pursuit </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles acted in the double capacity of butler and
steward to the old lady of the mansion </s>
<s>  brittles was a lad of allwork </s>
<s> 
who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a
promising young boy still though he was something past thirty </s>
<s> 

encouraging each other with such converse as this </s>
<s>  but keeping very
close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round
whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs </s>
<s>  the three men hurried
back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its
light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire </s>
<s>   catching up
the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot </s>
<s> 
and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the
light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like
some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was
swiftly borne </s>
<s> 

the air grew colder as day came slowly on </s>
<s>  and the mist rolled along
the ground like a dense cloud of smoke </s>
<s>   the grass was wet </s>
<s>  the
pathways and low places were all mire and water </s>
<s>  the damp breath of
an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning </s>
<s>   still
oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left
him </s>
<s> 

morning drew on apace </s>
<s>   the air become more sharp and piercing as its
first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of
dayglimmered faintly in the sky </s>
<s>   the objects which had looked dim
and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually
resolved into their familiar shapes </s>
<s>   the rain came down thick and
fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes </s>
<s>   but oliver felt
it not as it beat against him </s>
<s>  for he still lay stretched helpless
and unconscious on his bed of clay </s>
<s> 

at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed </s>
<s>  and
uttering it the boy awoke </s>
<s>   his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl
hung heavy and useless at his side </s>
<s>  the bandage was saturated with
blood </s>
<s>   he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a
sitting posture </s>
<s>  when he had done so he looked feebly round for help
and groaned with pain </s>
<s>   trembling in every joint from cold and
exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright </s>
<s>  but shuddering from
head to foot fell prostrate on the ground </s>
<s> 

after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long
plunged oliver </s>
<s>   urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which
seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die </s>
<s>   got upon
his feet and essayed to walk </s>
<s>  his head was dizzy and he staggered to
and fro like a drunken man </s>
<s>   but he kept up nevertheless and with
his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he
knew not whither </s>
<s> 

and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his
mind </s>
<s>   he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who
were angrily disputingfor the very words they said sounded in his
ears </s>
<s>  and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some
violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was
talking to them </s>
<s>  then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the
previous day </s>
<s>  and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers
grasp upon his wrist </s>
<s>  suddenly he started back at the report of
firearms </s>
<s>  there rose into the air loud cries and shouts </s>
<s>  lights
gleamed before his eyes </s>
<s>  all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand
bore him hurriedly away </s>
<s>   through all these rapid visions there ran an
undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented
him incessantly </s>
<s> 

thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars
of gates or through hedgegaps as they came in his way until he
reached a road </s>
<s>   here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused
him </s>
<s> 

he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house
which perhaps he could reach </s>
<s>   pitying his condition they might have
compassion on him </s>
<s>  and if they did not it would be better he thought
to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields </s>
<s>   he summoned
up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps
towards it </s>
<s> 

as he drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had
seen it before </s>
<s>   he remembered nothing of its details </s>
<s>  but the shape
and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him </s>
<s> 

that garden wall </s>
<s>   on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last
night and prayed the two mens mercy </s>
<s>   it was the very house they had
attempted to rob </s>
<s> 

oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that
for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of
flight </s>
<s>   flight </s>
<s>   he could scarcely stand </s>
<s>   and if he were in full
possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame
whither could he fly </s>
<s>   he pushed against the gardengate </s>
<s>  it was
unlocked and swung open on its hinges </s>
<s>   he tottered across the lawn </s>
<s> 
climbed the steps </s>
<s>  knocked faintly at the door </s>
<s>  and his whole strength
failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico </s>
<s> 

it happened that about this time <abvr> giles brittles and the tinker
were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the
night with tea and sundries in the kitchen </s>
<s>   not that it was <abvr>
giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants </s>
<s> 
towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty
affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of
his superior position in society </s>
<s>   but death fires and burglary
make all men equals </s>
<s>  so <abvr> giles sat with his legs stretched out
before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while
with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of
the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and
housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest </s>
<s> 

it was about halfpast two said <abvr> giles or i wouldnt swear that
it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and
turning round in my bed as it might be so here <abvr> giles turned
round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him
to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a noise </s>
<s> 

at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the
housemaid to shut the door </s>
<s>  who asked brittles who asked the tinker
who pretended not to hear </s>
<s> 

heerd a noise continued <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   i says at first this is
illusion </s>
<s>  and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the
noise again distinct </s>
<s> 

what sort of a noise </s>
<s>  asked the cook </s>
<s> 

a kind of a busting noise replied <abvr> giles looking round him </s>
<s> 

more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater
suggested brittles </s>
<s> 

it was when you heerd it sir rejoined <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  but at this
time it had a busting sound </s>
<s>   i turned down the clothes </s>
<s>  continued
giles rolling back the tablecloth sat up in bed </s>
<s>  and listened </s>
<s> 

the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor </s>
<s>  and drew their
chairs closer together </s>
<s> 

i heerd it now quite apparent resumed <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  somebody i
says is forcing of a door or window </s>
<s>  whats to be done </s>
<s>  ill call up
that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed </s>
<s> 
or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left
without his ever knowing it </s>
<s> 

here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the
speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face
expressive of the most unmitigated horror </s>
<s> 

i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth
and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of
bed </s>
<s>  drew on a pair of

ladies present <abvr> giles murmured the tinker </s>
<s> 

of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great
emphasis on the word </s>
<s>  seized the loaded pistol that always goes
upstairs with the platebasket </s>
<s>  and walked on tiptoes to his room </s>
<s> 
brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened </s>
<s> 

so you did observed brittles in a low voice </s>
<s> 

were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles </s>
<s>  but
dont be frightened </s>
<s> 

was he frightened </s>
<s>  asked the cook </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   he was as firmah </s>
<s>  pretty near
as firm as i was </s>
<s> 

i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the
housemaid </s>
<s> 

youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little </s>
<s> 

brittles is right said <abvr> giles nodding his head approvingly </s>
<s> 
from a woman nothing else was to be expected </s>
<s>  we being men took a
dark lantern that was standing on brittles hob and groped our way
downstairs in the pitch darkas it might be so </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes
shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he
started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried
back to his chair </s>
<s>   the cook and housemaid screamed </s>
<s> 

it was a knock said <abvr> giles assuming perfect serenity </s>
<s>  open the
door somebody </s>
<s> 

nobody moved </s>
<s> 

it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in
the morning said <abvr> giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him and looking very blank himself </s>
<s>  but the door must be opened </s>
<s>   do
you hear somebody </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles as he spoke looked at brittles </s>
<s>  but that young man being
naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that
the inquiry could not have any application to him </s>
<s>  at all events he
tendered no reply </s>
<s>  <abvr> giles directed an appealing glance at the
tinker </s>
<s>  but he had suddenly fallen asleep </s>
<s>   the women were out of the
question </s>
<s> 

if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses
said <abvr> giles after a short silence i am ready to make one </s>
<s> 

so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen
asleep </s>
<s> 

brittles capitulated on these terms </s>
<s>  and the party being somewhat
reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that
it was now broad day took their way upstairs </s>
<s>  with the dogs in front </s>
<s> 
the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear </s>
<s>   by
the advice of <abvr> giles they all talked very loud to warn any
evildisposed person outside that they were strong in numbers </s>
<s>  and by
a masterstoke of policy originating in the brain of the same
ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to
make them bark savagely </s>
<s> 

these precautions having been taken <abvr> giles held on fast by the
tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and
gave the word of command to open the door </s>
<s>   brittles obeyed </s>
<s>  the group
peeping timorously over each others shoulders beheld no more
formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and
exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their
compassion </s>
<s> 

a boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the
background </s>
<s>   whats the matter with theeh </s>
<s> whybrittleslook
heredont you know </s>
<s> 

brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver
than he uttered a loud cry </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles seizing the boy by one leg and
one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the
hall and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof </s>
<s> 

here he is </s>
<s>  bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up
the staircase </s>
<s>  heres one of the thieves maam </s>
<s>  heres a thief miss </s>
<s> 
wounded miss </s>
<s>   i shot him miss </s>
<s>  and brittles held the light </s>
<s> 

in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side
of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better </s>
<s> 

the two womenservants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that <abvr>
giles had captured a robber </s>
<s>  and the tinker busied himself in
endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be
hanged </s>
<s>   in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard
a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant </s>
<s> 

giles </s>
<s>  whispered the voice from the stairhead </s>
<s> 

im here miss replied <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   dont be frightened miss </s>
<s>  i
aint much injured </s>
<s>   he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss </s>
<s> 
i was soon too many for him </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  replied the young lady </s>
<s>  you frighten my aunt as much as the
thieves did </s>
<s>   is the poor creature much hurt </s>
<s> 

wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable
complacency </s>
<s> 

he looks as if he was agoing miss bawled brittles in the same
manner as before </s>
<s>   wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in
case he should </s>
<s> 

hush pray </s>
<s>  theres a good man </s>
<s>  rejoined the lady </s>
<s>   wait quietly
only one instant while i speak to aunt </s>
<s> 

with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped
away </s>
<s>   she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person
was to be carried carefully upstairs to <abvr> giless room </s>
<s>  and that
brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to
chertsey </s>
<s>   from which place he was to despatch with all speed a
constable and doctor </s>
<s> 

but wont you take one look at him first miss </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> giles
with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he
had skilfully brought down </s>
<s>   not one little peep miss </s>
<s> 

not now for the world replied the young lady </s>
<s>   poor fellow </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
treat him kindly giles for my sake </s>
<s> 

the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a
glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child </s>
<s>   then
bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and
solicitude of a woman </s>
<s> 



chapter xxix

has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which
oliver resorted

in a handsome room </s>
<s>   though its furniture had rather the air of
oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance </s>
<s>   there sat two ladies
at a wellspread breakfasttable </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles dressed with scrupulous
care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them </s>
<s>   he had
taken his station some halfway between the sideboard and the
breakfasttable </s>
<s>  and with his body drawn up to its full height his
head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left
leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his
left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who
laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance </s>
<s> 

of the two ladies one was well advanced in years </s>
<s>  but the highbacked
oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she </s>
<s>   dressed
with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of bygone
costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which
rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its
effect she sat in a stately manner with her hands folded on the
table before her </s>
<s>   her eyes and age had dimmed but little of their
brightness were attentively upon her young companion </s>
<s> 

the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood </s>
<s> 
at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned
in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in
such as hers </s>
<s> 

she was not past seventeen </s>
<s>   cast in so slight and exquisite a mould </s>
<s> 
so mild and gentle </s>
<s>  so pure and beautiful </s>
<s>  that earth seemed not her
element nor its rough creatures her fit companions </s>
<s>   the very
intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye and was stamped upon her
noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world </s>
<s>  and yet the
changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights
that played about the face and left no shadow there </s>
<s>  above all the
smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside
peace and happiness </s>
<s> 

she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table </s>
<s>  chancing to
raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her she playfully put
back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead </s>
<s>  and threw into
her beaming look such an expression of affection and artless
loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her </s>
<s> 

and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he </s>
<s>  asked the old
lady after a pause </s>
<s> 

an hour and twelve minutes maam replied <abvr> giles referring to a
silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon </s>
<s> 

he is always slow remarked the old lady </s>
<s> 

brittles always was a slow boy maam replied the attendant </s>
<s>  and
seeing by the bye that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of
thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a
fast one </s>
<s> 

he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady </s>
<s> 

it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other
boys said the young lady smiling </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the gardengate </s>
<s>  out
of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door </s>
<s> 
and who getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process
burst into the room and nearly overturned <abvr> giles and the
breakfasttable together </s>
<s> 

i never heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  exclaimed the fat gentleman </s>
<s>  my dear
mrs </s>
<s>  mayliebless my soulin the silence of the night tooi never
heard of such a thing </s>
<s> 

with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands
with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found
themselves </s>
<s> 

you ought to be dead </s>
<s>  positively dead with the fright said the fat
gentleman </s>
<s>   why didnt you send </s>
<s>   bless me my man should have come in
a minute </s>
<s>  and so would i </s>
<s>  and my assistant would have been delighted </s>
<s> 
or anybody im sure under such circumstances </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>   so
unexpected </s>
<s>   in the silence of the night too </s>
<s> 

the doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
been unexpected and attempted in the nighttime </s>
<s>  as if it were the
established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
business at noon and to make an appointment by post a day or two
previous </s>
<s> 

and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i

oh </s>
<s>  very much so indeed said rose interrupting him </s>
<s>  but there is
a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  to be sure replied the doctor so there is </s>
<s>   that was your
handiwork giles i understand </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles who had been feverishly putting the teacups to rights
blushed very red and said that he had had that honour </s>
<s> 

honour eh </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>  well i dont know </s>
<s>  perhaps its as
honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at
twelve paces </s>
<s>   fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a
duel giles </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was
not for the like of him to judge about that </s>
<s>  but he rather thought it
was no joke to the opposite party </s>
<s> 

gad thats true </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>   where is he </s>
<s>   show me the way </s>
<s> 
ill look in again as i come down <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   thats the little
window that he got in at eh </s>
<s>   well i couldnt have believed it </s>
<s> 

talking all the way he followed <abvr> giles upstairs </s>
<s>  and while he is
going upstairs the reader may be informed that <abvr> losberne a
surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles
round as the doctor had grown fat more from goodhumour than from
good living </s>
<s>   and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an
old bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any
explorer alive </s>
<s> 

the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had
anticipated </s>
<s>   a large flat box was fetched out of the gig </s>
<s>  and a
bedroom bell was rung very often </s>
<s>  and the servants ran up and down
stairs perpetually </s>
<s>  from which tokens it was justly concluded that
something important was going on above </s>
<s>   at length he returned </s>
<s>  and in
reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient </s>
<s>  looked very mysterious
and closed the door carefully </s>
<s> 

this is a very extraordinary thing <abvr> maylie said the doctor
standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut </s>
<s> 

he is not in danger i hope </s>
<s>  said the old lady </s>
<s> 

why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the
circumstances replied the doctor </s>
<s>  though i dont think he is </s>
<s>  have
you seen the thief </s>
<s> 

no rejoined the old lady </s>
<s> 

nor heard anything about him </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon maam interposed <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  but i was going to
tell you about him when doctor losberne came in </s>
<s> 

the fact was that <abvr> giles had not at first been able to bring his
mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy </s>
<s>   such commendations
had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of
him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes </s>
<s> 
during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief
reputation for undaunted courage </s>
<s> 

rose wished to see the man said <abvr> maylie but i wouldnt hear of
it </s>
<s> 

humph </s>
<s>  rejoined the doctor </s>
<s>   there is nothing very alarming in his
appearance </s>
<s>   have you any objection to see him in my presence </s>
<s> 

if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not </s>
<s> 

then i think it is necessary said the doctor </s>
<s>  at all events i am
quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you
postponed it </s>
<s>   he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now </s>
<s>  allow
memiss rose will you permit me </s>
<s>   not the slightest fear i pledge
you my honour </s>

chapter xxx

relates what olivers new visitors thought of him

with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised
in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm
through one of his </s>
<s>  and offering his disengaged hand to <abvr> maylie
led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs </s>
<s> 

now said the doctor in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of
a bedroomdoor let us hear what you think of him </s>
<s>   he has not been
shaved very recently but he dont look at all ferocious
notwithstanding </s>
<s>   stop though </s>
<s>   let me first see that he is in
visiting order </s>
<s> 

stepping before them he looked into the room </s>
<s>   motioning them to
advance he closed the door when they had entered </s>
<s>  and gently drew back
the curtains of the bed </s>
<s>   upon it in lieu of the dogged blackvisaged
ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere child </s>
<s>   worn with
pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep </s>
<s>   his wounded arm
bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast </s>
<s>  his head reclined
upon the other arm which was half hidden by his long hair as it
streamed over the pillow </s>
<s> 

the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a
minute or so in silence </s>
<s>   whilst he was watching the patient thus the
younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the
bedside gathered olivers hair from his face </s>
<s>   as she stooped over
him her tears fell upon his forehead </s>
<s> 

the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity
and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
he had never known </s>
<s>   thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of
water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or the mention of a
familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
that never were in this life </s>
<s>  which vanish like a breath </s>
<s>  which some
brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have
awakened </s>
<s>  which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall </s>
<s> 

what can this mean </s>
<s>  exclaimed the elder lady </s>
<s>   this poor child can
never have been the pupil of robbers </s>
<s> 

vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in
many temples </s>
<s>  and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine
her </s>
<s> 

but at so early an age </s>
<s>  urged rose </s>
<s> 

my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his
head </s>
<s>  crime like death is not confined to the old and withered
alone </s>
<s>   the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims </s>
<s> 

but can youoh </s>
<s>  can you really believe that this delicate boy has
been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society </s>
<s>  said
rose </s>
<s> 

the surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared
it was very possible </s>
<s>  and observing that they might disturb the
patient led the way into an adjoining apartment </s>
<s> 

but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is </s>
<s> 
think that he may never have known a mothers love or the comfort of a
home </s>
<s>  that illusage and blows or the want of bread may have driven
him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt </s>
<s>   aunt dear aunt
for mercys sake think of this before you let them drag this sick
child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his
chances of amendment </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  as you love me and know that i have never
felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i
might have done so and might have been equally helpless and
unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too
late </s>
<s> 

my dear love said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to
her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  replied rose eagerly </s>
<s> 

no surely said the old lady </s>
<s>  my days are drawing to their close </s>
<s> 
and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others </s>
<s>  what can i do to
save him sir </s>
<s> 

let me think maam said the doctor </s>
<s>  let me think </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns
up and down the room </s>
<s>  often stopping and balancing himself on his
toes and frowning frightfully </s>
<s>   after various exclamations of ive
got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking
and frowning he at length made a dead halt and spoke as follows </s>
<s> 

i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles
and that little boy brittles i can manage it </s>
<s>   giles is a faithful
fellow and an old servant i know </s>
<s>  but you can make it up to him in a
thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides </s>
<s>   you
dont object to that </s>
<s> 

unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied <abvr>
maylie </s>
<s> 

there is no other said the doctor </s>
<s>   no other take my word for it </s>
<s> 

then my aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through
her tears </s>
<s>  but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is
indispensably necessary </s>
<s> 

you seem to think retorted the doctor that everybody is disposed
to be hardhearted today except yourself miss rose </s>
<s>  i only hope for
the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as
vulnerable and softhearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow
who appeals to your compassion </s>
<s>  and i wish i were a young fellow that
i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for
doing so as the present </s>
<s> 

you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself returned rose
blushing </s>
<s> 

well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult
matter </s>
<s>   but to return to this boy </s>
<s>   the great point of our agreement
is yet to come </s>
<s>   he will wake in an hour or so i dare say </s>
<s>  and
although i have told that thickheaded constablefellow downstairs that
he musnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may
converse with him without danger </s>
<s>   now i make this stipulationthat i
shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we
judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he
is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall
be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at
all events </s>
<s> 

oh no aunt </s>
<s>  entreated rose </s>
<s> 

oh yes aunt </s>
<s>  said the doctor </s>
<s>   is is a bargain </s>
<s> 

he cannot be hardened in vice said rose </s>
<s>  it is impossible </s>
<s> 

very good retorted the doctor </s>
<s>  then so much the more reason for
acceding to my proposition </s>
<s> 

finally the treaty was entered into </s>
<s>  and the parties thereunto sat down
to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake </s>
<s> 

the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial
than <abvr> losberne had led them to expect </s>
<s>  for hour after hour passed
on and still oliver slumbered heavily </s>
<s>   it was evening indeed before
the kindhearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he was at
length sufficiently restored to be spoken to </s>
<s>   the boy was very ill he
said and weak from the loss of blood </s>
<s>  but his mind was so troubled
with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give
him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next
morning </s>
<s>  which he should otherwise have done </s>
<s> 

the conference was a long one </s>
<s>   oliver told them all his simple
history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength </s>
<s> 
it was a solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice
of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities
which hard men had brought upon him </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  if when we oppress and grind
our fellowcreatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences
of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly
it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their
aftervengeance on our heads </s>
<s>  if we heard but one instant in
imagination the deep testimony of dead mens voices which no power
can stifle and no pride shut out </s>
<s>  where would be the injury and
injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each days
life brings with it </s>
<s> 

olivers pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night </s>
<s>  and loveliness
and virtue watched him as he slept </s>
<s>   he felt calm and happy and could
have died without a murmur </s>
<s> 

the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to
rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them
for being weak all at once betook himself downstairs to open upon <abvr>
giles </s>
<s>   and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that
he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the
kitchen </s>
<s>  so into the kitchen he went </s>
<s> 

there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament
the womenservants <abvr> brittles <abvr> giles the tinker who had
received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of
the day in consideration of his services and the constable </s>
<s>   the
latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and
large halfboots </s>
<s>  and he looked as if he had been taking a
proportionate allowance of aleas indeed he had </s>
<s> 

the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion </s>
<s>  for
mr </s>
<s>  giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind when the doctor
entered </s>
<s>  <abvr> brittles with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating
everything before his superior said it </s>
<s> 

sit still </s>
<s>  said the doctor waving his hand </s>
<s> 

thank you sir said <abvr> giles </s>
<s>   misses wished some ale to be given
out sir </s>
<s>  and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir
and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here </s>
<s> 

brittles headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen
generally were understood to express the gratification they derived
from <abvr> giless condescension </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles looked round with a
patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved
properly he would never desert them </s>
<s> 

how is the patient tonight sir </s>
<s>  asked giles </s>
<s> 

soso </s>
<s>  returned the doctor </s>
<s>   i am afraid you have got yourself into
a scrape there <abvr> giles </s>
<s> 

i hope you dont mean to say sir said <abvr> giles trembling that
hes going to die </s>
<s>   if i thought it i should never be happy again </s>
<s>   i
wouldnt cut a boy off </s>
<s>   no not even brittles here </s>
<s>  not for all the
plate in the county sir </s>
<s> 

thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously </s>
<s>   <abvr> giles are
you a protestant </s>
<s> 

yes sir i hope so faltered <abvr> giles who had turned very pale </s>
<s> 

and what are you boy </s>
<s>  said the doctor turning sharply upon
brittles </s>
<s> 

lord bless me sir </s>
<s>  replied brittles starting violently </s>
<s>  im the
same as <abvr> giles sir </s>
<s> 

then tell me this said the doctor both of you both of you </s>
<s>  are
you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is
the boy that was put through the little window last night </s>
<s>   out with
it </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   we are prepared for you </s>
<s> 

the doctor who was universally considered one of the besttempered
creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger
that giles and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and
excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction </s>
<s> 

pay attention to the reply constable will you </s>
<s>  said the doctor
shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the
bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthys
utmost acuteness </s>
<s>  something may come of this before long </s>
<s> 

the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of
office </s>
<s>  which had been reclining indolently in the chimneycorner </s>
<s> 

its a simple question of identity you will observe said the doctor </s>
<s> 

thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great
violence </s>
<s>  for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had
gone the wrong way </s>
<s> 

heres the house broken into said the doctor and a couple of men
catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke
and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness </s>
<s>   heres a boy comes
to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have
his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon himby doing which
they place his life in great dangerand swear he is the thief </s>
<s>   now
the question is whether these men are justified by the fact </s>
<s>  if not
in what situation do they place themselves </s>
<s> 

the constable nodded profoundly </s>
<s>   he said if that wasnt law he would
be glad to know what was </s>
<s> 

i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn
oaths able to identify that boy </s>
<s> 

brittles looked doubtfully at <abvr> giles </s>
<s>  <abvr> giles looked doubtfully at
brittles </s>
<s>  the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the
reply </s>
<s>  the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen </s>
<s>  the
doctor glanced keenly round </s>
<s>  when a ring was heard at the gate and at
the same moment the sound of wheels </s>
<s> 

its the runners </s>
<s>  cried brittles to all appearance much relieved </s>
<s> 

the what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn </s>
<s> 

the bow street officers sir replied brittles taking up a candle </s>
<s> 
me and <abvr> giles sent for em this morning </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  cried the doctor </s>
<s> 

yes replied brittles </s>
<s>  i sent a message up by the coachman and i
only wonder they werent here before sir </s>
<s> 

you did did you </s>
<s>   then confound yourslow coaches down here </s>

all said the doctor walking away </s>

chapter xxxi

involves a critical position

whos that </s>
<s>  inquired brittles opening the door a little way with
the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand </s>
<s> 

open the door replied a man outside </s>
<s>  its the officers from bow
street as was sent to today </s>
<s> 

much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the door to its full
width and confronted a portly man in a greatcoat </s>
<s>  who walked in
without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly
as if he lived there </s>
<s> 

just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man </s>
<s>  said
the officer </s>
<s>  hes in the gig aminding the prad </s>
<s>   have you got a
coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes </s>
<s> 

brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building
the portly man stepped back to the gardengate and helped his
companion to put up the gig </s>
<s>   while brittles lighted them in a state
of great admiration </s>
<s>   this done they returned to the house and being
shown into a parlour took off their greatcoats and hats and showed
like what they were </s>
<s> 

the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle
height aged about fifty </s>
<s>  with shiny black hair cropped pretty close </s>
<s> 
halfwhiskers a round face and sharp eyes </s>
<s>   the other was a
redheaded bony man in topboots </s>
<s>  with a rather illfavoured
countenance and a turnedup sinisterlooking nose </s>
<s> 

tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you </s>
<s>  said the
stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on
the table </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>   goodevening master </s>
<s>   can i have a word or two with
you in private if you please </s>
<s> 

this was addressed to <abvr> losberne who now made his appearance </s>
<s>  that
gentleman motioning brittles to retire brought in the two ladies and
shut the door </s>
<s> 

this is the lady of the house said <abvr> losberne motioning towards
mrs </s>
<s>  maylie </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  blathers made a bow </s>
<s>   being desired to sit down he put his hat on
the floor and taking a chair motioned to duff to do the same </s>
<s>   the
latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good
society or quite so much at his ease in itone of the twoseated
himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and
the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment </s>
<s> 

now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers </s>
<s>  what
are the circumstances </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at
great length and with much circumlocution </s>
<s>   messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff
looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod </s>
<s> 

i cant say for certain till i see the work of course said
blathers </s>
<s>  but my opinion at once isi dont mind committing myself
to that extentthat this wasnt done by a yokel </s>
<s>  eh duff </s>
<s> 

certainly not replied duff </s>
<s> 

and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i
apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a
countryman </s>
<s>  said <abvr> losberne with a smile </s>
<s> 

thats it master replied blathers </s>
<s>   this is all about the robbery
is it </s>
<s> 

all replied the doctor </s>
<s> 

now what is this about this here boy that the servants are atalking
on </s>
<s>  said blathers </s>
<s> 

nothing at all replied the doctor </s>
<s>   one of the frightened servants
chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house </s>
<s>  but its nonsense </s>
<s>  sheer absurdity </s>
<s> 

wery easy disposed of if it is remarked duff </s>
<s> 

what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in
a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if
they were a pair of castanets </s>
<s>   who is the boy </s>
<s>  what account does he
give of himself </s>
<s>   where did he come from </s>
<s>  he didnt drop out of the
clouds did he master </s>
<s> 

of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two
ladies </s>
<s>   i know his whole history </s>
<s>  but we can talk about that
presently </s>
<s>   you would like first to see the place where the thieves
made their attempt i suppose </s>
<s> 

certainly rejoined <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>   we had better inspect the
premises first and examine the servants afterwards </s>
<s>  thats the usual
way of doing business </s>
<s> 

lights were then procured </s>
<s>  and messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff attended by
the native constable brittles giles and everybody else in short
went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at
the window </s>
<s>  and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in
at the window </s>
<s>  and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the
shutter with </s>
<s>  and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with </s>
<s> 
and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with </s>
<s>   this done amidst
the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of
their share in the previous nights adventures </s>
<s>  which they performed
some six times over </s>
<s>  contradicting each other in not more than one
important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the
last </s>
<s>   this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared
the room and held a long council together compared with which for
secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest
point in medicine would be mere childs play </s>
<s> 

meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
state </s>
<s>  and <abvr> maylie and rose looked on with anxious faces </s>
<s> 

upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very
rapid turns i hardly know what to do </s>
<s> 

surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to
these men will be sufficient to exonerate him </s>
<s> 

i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head </s>
<s> 
i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal
functionaries of a higher grade </s>
<s>   what is he after all they would
say </s>
<s>   a runaway </s>
<s>   judged by mere worldly considerations and
probabilities his story is a very doubtful one </s>
<s> 

you believe it surely </s>
<s>  interrupted rose </s>
<s> 

i believe it strange as it is </s>
<s>  and perhaps i may be an old fool for
doing so rejoined the doctor </s>
<s>  but i dont think it is exactly the
tale for a practical policeofficer nevertheless </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s>  demanded rose </s>
<s> 

because my pretty crossexaminer replied the doctor </s>
<s>  because
viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it </s>
<s>  he can
only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well </s>
<s> 
confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and
will take nothing for granted </s>
<s>   on his own showing you see he has
been the companion of thieves for some time past </s>
<s>  he has been carried
to a policeofficer on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket </s>
<s>  he
has been taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place
which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he
has not the remotest idea </s>
<s>   he is brought down to chertsey by men who
seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no </s>
<s>  and
is put through a window to rob a house </s>
<s>  and then just at the very
moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing
that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a
blundering dog of a halfbred butler and shoots him </s>
<s>  as if on purpose
to prevent his doing any good for himself </s>
<s>  dont you see all this </s>
<s> 

i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors
impetuosity </s>
<s>  but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the
poor child </s>
<s> 

no replied the doctor </s>
<s>  of course not </s>
<s>   bless the bright eyes of
your sex </s>
<s>   they never see whether for good or bad more than one side
of any question </s>
<s>  and that is always the one which first presents
itself to them </s>
<s> 

having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his
hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even
greater rapidity than before </s>
<s> 

the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will
occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
possession of the boys real story </s>
<s>   i am certain it will not be
believed </s>
<s>  and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the
dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will
be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan
of rescuing him from misery </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  what is to be done </s>
<s>  cried rose </s>
<s>   dear dear </s>
<s>  why did they send
for these people </s>
<s> 

why indeed </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   i would not have had them here
for the world </s>
<s> 

all i know is said <abvr> losberne at last </s>
<s>   sitting down with a kind
of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold
face </s>
<s>   the object is a good one and that must be our excuse </s>
<s>   the boy
has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be
talked to any more </s>
<s>  thats one comfort </s>
<s>   we must make the best of it </s>
<s> 
and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours </s>
<s>   come in </s>
<s> 

well master said blathers entering the room followed by his
colleague and making the door fast before he said any more </s>
<s>  this
warnt a putup thing </s>
<s> 

and what the devils a putup thing </s>
<s>  demanded the doctor impatiently </s>
<s> 

we call it a putup robbery ladies said blathers turning to them
as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors
when the servants is in it </s>
<s> 

nobody suspected them in this case said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

wery likely not maam replied blathers </s>
<s>  but they might have been
in it for all that </s>
<s> 

more likely on that wery account said duff </s>
<s> 

we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report </s>
<s> 
for the style of work is firstrate </s>
<s> 

wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an undertone </s>
<s> 

there was two of em in it continued blathers </s>
<s>  and they had a boy
with em </s>
<s>  thats plain from the size of the window </s>
<s>   thats all to be
said at present </s>
<s>   well see this lad that youve got upstairs at once
if you please </s>
<s> 

perhaps they will take something to drink first <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  said
the doctor </s>
<s>  his face brightening as if some new thought had occurred
to him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to be sure </s>
<s>  exclaimed rose eagerly </s>
<s>   you shall have it
immediately if you will </s>
<s> 

why thank you miss </s>
<s>  said blathers drawing his coatsleeve across
his mouth </s>
<s>  its dry work this sort of duty </s>
<s>   anythink thats handy
miss </s>
<s>  dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts </s>
<s> 

what shall it be </s>
<s>  asked the doctor following the young lady to the
sideboard </s>
<s> 

a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied
blathers </s>
<s>   its a cold ride from london maam </s>
<s>  and i always find that
spirits comes home warmer to the feelings </s>
<s> 

this interesting communication was addressed to <abvr> maylie who
received it very graciously </s>
<s>   while it was being conveyed to her the
doctor slipped out of the room </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>   not holding his wineglass by the stem but
grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand </s>
<s> 
and placing it in front of his chest </s>
<s>  i have seen a good many pieces
of business like this in my time ladies </s>
<s> 

that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said <abvr>
duff assisting his colleagues memory </s>
<s> 

that was something in this way warnt it </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 
that was done by conkey chickweed that was </s>
<s> 

you always gave that to him replied duff </s>
<s>   it was the family pet i
tell you </s>
<s>   conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had </s>
<s> 

get out </s>
<s>  retorted <abvr> blathers </s>
<s>  i know better </s>
<s>   do you mind that
time when conkey was robbed of his money though </s>
<s>   what a start that
was </s>
<s>   better than any novelbook i ever see </s>
<s> 

what was that </s>
<s>  inquired rose </s>
<s>   anxious to encourage any symptoms of
goodhumour in the unwelcome visitors </s>
<s> 

it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down
upon said blathers </s>
<s>   this here conkey chickweed

conkey means nosey maam interposed duff </s>
<s> 

of course the lady knows that dont she </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 
always interrupting you are partner </s>
<s>   this here conkey chickweed
miss kept a publichouse over battlebridge way and he had a cellar
where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and
badgerdrawing and that </s>
<s>  and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
conducted in for ive seen em offen </s>
<s>   he warnt one of the family
at that time </s>
<s>  and one night he was robbed of three hundred and
twentyseven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom
in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye
who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the
robbery jumped slap out of window </s>
<s>   which was only a story high </s>
<s>  he
was wery quick about it </s>
<s>   but conkey was quick too </s>
<s>  for he fired a
blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  they set up a
hueandcry directly and when they came to look about em found that
conkey had hit the robber </s>
<s>  for there was traces of blood all the way
to some palings a good distance off </s>
<s>  and there they lost em </s>
<s>   however
he had made off with the blunt </s>
<s>  and consequently the name of <abvr>
chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other
bankrupts </s>
<s>  and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont
know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state
of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or
four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many
people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself </s>
<s>  one day
he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview
with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and
orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go
and assist <abvr> chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house </s>
<s> 
i see him spyers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morning
why didnt you up and collar him </s>
<s>  says spyers </s>
<s>   i was so struck all
of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick
says the poor man </s>
<s>  but were sure to have him </s>
<s>  for between ten and
eleven oclock at night he passed again </s>
<s>   spyers no sooner heard this
than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he
should have to stop a day or two </s>
<s>  and away he goes and sets himself
down at one of the publichouse windows behind the little red curtain
with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moments notice </s>
<s>  he was
smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed
roars out here he is </s>
<s>  stop thief </s>
<s>   murder </s>
<s>   jem spyers dashes out </s>
<s> 
and there he sees chickweed atearing down the street full cry </s>
<s>   away
goes spyers </s>
<s>  on goes chickweed </s>
<s>  round turns the people </s>
<s>  everybody roars
out thieves </s>
<s>  and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time
like mad </s>
<s>   spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner </s>
<s> 
shoots round </s>
<s>  sees a little crowd </s>
<s>  dives in </s>
<s>  which is the man </s>
<s> 
dme </s>
<s>  says chickweed ive lost him again </s>
<s>   it was a remarkable
occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the
publichouse </s>
<s>  next morning spyers took his old place and looked out
from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his
eye till his own two eyes ached again </s>
<s>   at last he couldnt help
shutting em to ease em a minute </s>
<s>  and the very moment he did so he
hears chickweed aroaring out here he is </s>
<s>   off he starts once more
with chickweed halfway down the street ahead of him </s>
<s>  and after twice
as long a run as the yesterdays one the mans lost again </s>
<s>   this was
done once or twice more till onehalf the neighbours gave out that
mr </s>
<s>  chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with
him arterwards </s>
<s>  and the other half that poor <abvr> chickweed had gone
mad with grief </s>
<s> 

what did jem spyers say </s>
<s>  inquired the doctor </s>
<s>  who had returned to the
room shortly after the commencement of the story </s>
<s> 

jem spyers resumed the officer for a long time said nothing at
all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he
understood his business </s>
<s>   but one morning he walked into the bar and
taking out his snuffbox says chickweed ive found out who done this
here robbery </s>
<s>   have you </s>
<s>  said chickweed </s>
<s>   oh my dear spyers only
let me have wengeance and i shall die contented </s>

snuff none of that gammon </s>
<s>   you did it yourself </s>

good bit of money he had made by it too </s>

appearances </s>

clinking the handcuffs together </s>
<s> 

very curious indeed observed the doctor </s>
<s>   now if you please you
can walk upstairs </s>

oliver had been dozing </s>

had appeared yet </s>
<s>   being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up
in bed for a minute or so </s>
<s>  and looked at the strangers without at all
understanding what was going forwardin fact without seeming to
recollect where he was or what had been passing </s>
<s> 

this said <abvr> losberne speaking softly but with great vehemence
notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a
springgun in some boyish trespass on <abvr> whatd yecallhims
grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this
morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand </s>

life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify </s>

messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff looked at <abvr> giles as he was thus
recommended to their notice </s>
<s>   the bewildered butler gazed from them
towards oliver and from oliver towards <abvr> losberne with a most
ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to deny that i suppose </s>
<s>  said the doctor laying
oliver gently down again </s>
<s> 

it was all done for thefor the best sir answered giles </s>
<s>  i am
sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him </s>
<s>   i
am not of an inhuman disposition sir </s>
<s> 

thought it was what boy </s>
<s>  inquired the senior officer </s>
<s> 

the housebreakers boy sir </s>
<s>  replied giles </s>
<s>   theythey certainly
had a boy </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>   do you think so now </s>
<s>  inquired blathers </s>
<s> 

think what now </s>
<s>  replied giles looking vacantly at his questioner </s>
<s> 

think its the same boy stupidhead </s>
<s>  rejoined blathers impatiently </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s>  i really dont know said giles with a rueful
countenance </s>
<s>   i couldnt swear to him </s>
<s> 

what do you think </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> blathers </s>
<s> 

i dont know what to think replied poor giles </s>
<s>   i dont think it is
the boy </s>
<s>  indeed im almost certain that it isnt </s>
<s>   you know it cant
be </s>
<s> 

has this man been adrinking sir </s>
<s>  inquired blathers turning to the
doctor </s>
<s> 

what a precious muddleheaded chap you are </s>
<s>  said duff addressing <abvr>
giles with supreme contempt </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short
dialogue </s>
<s>  but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked
that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would
perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittles before them </s>
<s> 

acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring
apartment where <abvr> brittles being called in involved himself and
his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light on
anything but the fact of his own strong mystification </s>
<s>  except indeed
his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put
before him that instant </s>
<s>  that he had only taken oliver to be he
because <abvr> giles had said he was </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> giles had five minutes
previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much
afraid he had been a little too hasty </s>
<s> 

among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether
mr </s>
<s>  giles had really hit anybody </s>
<s>  and upon examination of the fellow
pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more
destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper </s>
<s>  a discovery which
made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor who had
drawn the ball about ten minutes before </s>
<s>  upon no one however did it
make a greater impression than on <abvr> giles himself </s>
<s>  who after
labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a
fellowcreature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to
the utmost </s>
<s>   finally the officers without troubling themselves very
much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took
up their rest for that night in the town </s>
<s>  promising to return the next
morning </s>
<s> 

with the next morning there came a rumour that two men and a boy were
in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended over night under
suspicious circumstances </s>
<s>  and to kingston messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff
journeyed accordingly </s>
<s>  the suspicious circumstances however resolving
themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been
discovered sleeping under a haystack </s>
<s>  which although a great crime is
only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the
english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects
held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence
that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with
violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
punishment of death </s>
<s>  messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff came back again as wise
as they went </s>
<s> 

in short after some more examination and a great deal more
conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the
joint bail of <abvr> maylie and <abvr> losberne for olivers appearance if
he should ever be called upon </s>
<s>  and blathers and duff being rewarded
with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the
subject of their expedition </s>
<s>  the latter gentleman on a mature
consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that
the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet </s>
<s>  and the
former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
great <abvr> conkey chickweed </s>
<s> 

meanwhile oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care
of <abvr> maylie rose and the kindhearted <abvr> losberne </s>
<s>   if fervent
prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in

orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing

chapter xxxii

of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends

olivers ailings were neither slight nor few </s>
<s>   in addition to the pain
and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold
had brought on fever and ague </s>
<s>   which hung about him for many weeks
and reduced him sadly </s>
<s>  but at length he began by slow degrees to
get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words
how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how
ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do
something to show his gratitude </s>
<s>  only something which would let them
see the love and duty with which his breast was full </s>
<s>  something
however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness
had not been cast away </s>
<s>  but that the poor boy whom their charity had
rescued from misery or death was eager to serve them with his whole
heart and soul </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  said rose when oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale
lips </s>
<s>  you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will </s>
<s> 
we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall
accompany us </s>
<s>   the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasure and
beauties of spring will restore you in a few days </s>
<s>   we will employ you
in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble </s>
<s> 

the trouble </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  dear lady if i could but work for
you </s>
<s>  if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or
watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make
you happy </s>
<s>  what would i give to do it </s>
<s> 

you shall give nothing at all said miss maylie smiling </s>
<s>  for as i
told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways </s>
<s>  and if you only
take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make
me very happy indeed </s>
<s> 

happy maam </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>  how kind of you to say so </s>
<s> 

you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady </s>
<s> 
to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an
unspeakable pleasure to me </s>
<s>  but to know that the object of her goodness
and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence
would delight me more than you can well imagine </s>
<s>   do you understand
me </s>
<s>  she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face </s>
<s> 

oh yes maam yes </s>
<s>  replied oliver eagerly </s>
<s>  but i was thinking that
i am ungrateful now </s>
<s> 

to whom </s>
<s>  inquired the young lady </s>
<s> 

to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care
of me before rejoined oliver </s>
<s>   if they knew how happy i am they
would be pleased i am sure </s>
<s> 

i am sure they would rejoined olivers benefactress </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well
enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them </s>
<s> 

has he maam </s>
<s>  cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure </s>
<s>   i
dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once
again </s>
<s> 

in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the
fatigue of this expedition </s>
<s>   one morning he and <abvr> losberne set out
accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   when
they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a
loud exclamation </s>
<s> 

whats the matter with the boy </s>
<s>  cried the doctor as usual all in a
bustle </s>
<s>   do you see anythinghear anythingfeel anythingeh </s>
<s> 

that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window </s>
<s>  that
house </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  well what of it </s>
<s>   stop coachman </s>
<s>   pull up here cried the
doctor </s>
<s>   what of the house my man </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

the thievesthe house they took me to </s>
<s>  whispered oliver </s>
<s> 

the devil it is </s>
<s>  cried the doctor </s>
<s>   hallo there </s>
<s>  let me out </s>
<s> 

but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled
out of the coach by some means or other </s>
<s>  and running down to the
deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said a little ugly humpbacked man </s>
<s>   opening the door so
suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick
nearly fell forward into the passage </s>
<s>  whats the matter here </s>
<s> 

matter </s>
<s>  exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments
reflection </s>
<s>   a good deal </s>
<s>   robbery is the matter </s>
<s> 

therell be murder the matter too replied the humpbacked man
coolly if you dont take your hands off </s>
<s>   do you hear me </s>
<s> 

i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake </s>
<s> 

wheresconfound the fellow whats his rascally namesikes </s>
<s>  thats
it </s>
<s>   wheres sikes you thief </s>
<s> 

the humpbacked man stared as if in excess of amazement and
indignation </s>
<s>  then twisting himself dexterously from the doctors
grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the
house </s>
<s>   before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed
into the parlour without a word of parley </s>
<s> 

he looked anxiously round </s>
<s>  not an article of furniture </s>
<s>  not a vestige
of anything animate or inanimate </s>
<s>  not even the position of the
cupboards </s>
<s>  answered olivers description </s>
<s> 

now </s>
<s>  said the humpbacked man who had watched him keenly what do
you mean by coming into my house in this violent way </s>
<s>  do you want to
rob me or to murder me </s>
<s>   which is it </s>
<s> 

did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair
you ridiculous old vampire </s>
<s>  said the irritable doctor </s>
<s> 

what do you want then </s>
<s>  demanded the hunchback </s>
<s>   will you take
yourself off before i do you a mischief </s>
<s>   curse you </s>
<s> 

as soon as i think proper said <abvr> losberne looking into the other
parlour </s>
<s>  which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to
olivers account of it </s>
<s>   i shall find you out some day my friend </s>
<s> 

will you </s>
<s>  sneered the illfavoured cripple </s>
<s>   if you ever want me
im here </s>
<s>   i havent lived here mad and all alone for fiveandtwenty
years to be scared by you </s>
<s>   you shall pay for this </s>
<s>  you shall pay for
this </s>
<s>   and so saying the misshapen little demon set up a yell and
danced upon the ground as if wild with rage </s>
<s> 

stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself </s>
<s>  the boy must
have made a mistake </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>   put that in your pocket and shut yourself
up again </s>
<s>   with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money
and returned to the carriage </s>
<s> 

the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations
and curses all the way </s>
<s>  but as <abvr> losberne turned to speak to the
driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant
with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and
vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months
afterwards </s>
<s>   he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until
the driver had resumed his seat </s>
<s>  and when they were once more on their
way they could see him some distance behind </s>
<s>  beating his feet upon the
ground and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage </s>
<s> 

i am an ass </s>
<s>  said the doctor after a long silence </s>
<s>   did you know
that before oliver </s>
<s> 

no sir </s>
<s> 

then dont forget it another time </s>
<s> 

an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some
minutes </s>
<s>   even if it had been the right place and the right fellows
had been there what could i have done singlehanded </s>
<s>  and if i had had
assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my
own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i
have hushed up this business </s>
<s>  that would have served me right though </s>
<s> 
i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on
impulse </s>
<s>   it might have done me good </s>
<s> 

now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon
anything but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment
to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from
being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the
warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him </s>
<s>   if the truth must be
told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being
disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on
the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any </s>
<s>   he
soon came round again however </s>
<s>  and finding that olivers replies to
his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still
delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever
been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that
time forth </s>
<s> 

as oliver knew the name of the street in which <abvr> brownlow resided
they were enabled to drive straight thither </s>
<s>   when the coach turned
into it his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his
breath </s>
<s> 

now my boy which house is it </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> losberne </s>
<s> 

that </s>
<s>   that </s>
<s>  replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window </s>
<s> 
the white house </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  make haste </s>
<s>   pray make haste </s>
<s>  i feel as if i
should die </s>
<s>  it makes me tremble so </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  you
will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and
well </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   i hope so </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s>   they were so good to me </s>
<s>  so very
very good to me </s>
<s> 

the coach rolled on </s>
<s>   it stopped </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  that was the wrong house </s>
<s>  the
next door </s>
<s>   it went on a few paces and stopped again </s>
<s>  oliver looked up
at the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>  the white house was empty and there was a bill in the window </s>
<s> 
to let </s>
<s> 

knock at the next door cried <abvr> losberne taking olivers arm in
his </s>
<s>   what has become of <abvr> brownlow who used to live in the
adjoining house do you know </s>
<s> 

the servant did not know </s>
<s>  but would go and inquire </s>
<s>   she presently
returned and said that <abvr> brownlow had sold off his goods and gone
to the west indies six weeks before </s>
<s>   oliver clasped his hands and
sank feebly backward </s>
<s> 

has his housekeeper gone too </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> losberne after a moments
pause </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>
<s>  replied the servant </s>
<s>   the old gentleman the housekeeper
and a gentleman who was a friend of <abvr> brownlows all went together </s>
<s> 

then turn towards home again said <abvr> losberne to the driver </s>
<s>  and
dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded
london </s>
<s> 

the bookstall keeper sir </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>   i know the way there </s>
<s>   see
him pray sir </s>
<s>   do see him </s>
<s> 

my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day said the
doctor </s>
<s>   quite enough for both of us </s>
<s>   if we go to the bookstall
keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house
on fire or run away </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  home again straight </s>
<s>   and in obedience to
the doctors impulse home they went </s>
<s> 

this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in
the midst of his happiness </s>
<s>  for he had pleased himself many times
during his illness with thinking of all that <abvr> brownlow and <abvr>
bedwin would say to him </s>
<s>  and what delight it would be to tell them how
many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had
done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them </s>
<s>  the hope
of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he
had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many
of his recent trials </s>
<s>  and now the idea that they should have gone so
far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a
robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying
daywas almost more than he could bear </s>
<s> 

the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of
his benefactors </s>
<s>   after another fortnight when the fine warm weather
had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young
leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house
at chertsey for some months </s>
<s> 

sending the plate which had so excited fagins cupidity to the
bankers </s>
<s>  and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took
oliver with them </s>
<s> 

who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft
tranquillity the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green
hills and rich woods of an inland village </s>
<s>   who can tell how scenes of
peace and quietude sink into the minds of painworn dwellers in close
and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded
hearts </s>
<s>   men who have lived in crowded pentup streets through lives
of toil and who have never wished for change </s>
<s>  men to whom custom has
indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick
and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks </s>
<s>  even
they with the hand of death upon them have been known to yearn at
last for one short glimpse of natures face </s>
<s>  and carried far from the
scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once
into a new state of being </s>
<s>   crawling forth from day to day to some
green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by
the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a
foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they
have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they
watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before faded
from their dim and feeble sight </s>
<s>   the memories which peaceful country
scenes call up are not of this world nor of its thoughts and hopes </s>
<s> 
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the
graves of those we loved </s>
<s>   may purify our thoughts and bear down
before it old enmity and hatred </s>
<s>  but beneath all this there lingers
in the least reflective mind a vague and halfformed consciousness of
having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time
which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down
pride and worldliness beneath it </s>
<s> 

it was a lovely spot to which they repaired </s>
<s>   oliver whose days had
been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and
brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there </s>
<s>   the rose and
honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls </s>
<s>  the ivy crept round the trunks
of the trees </s>
<s>  and the gardenflowers perfumed the air with delicious
odours </s>
<s>   hard by was a little churchyard </s>
<s>  not crowded with tall
unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh
turf and moss </s>
<s>  beneath which the old people of the village lay at
rest </s>
<s>   oliver often wandered here </s>
<s>  and thinking of the wretched grave
in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen </s>
<s> 
but when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead he would cease
to think of her as lying in the ground and would weep for her sadly
but without pain </s>
<s> 

it was a happy time </s>
<s>   the days were peaceful and serene </s>
<s>  the nights
brought with them neither fear nor care </s>
<s>  no languishing in a wretched
prison or associating with wretched men </s>
<s>  nothing but pleasant and
happy thoughts </s>
<s>   every morning he went to a whiteheaded old gentleman
who lived near the little church </s>
<s>  who taught him to read better and to
write </s>
<s>   and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could
never try enough to please him </s>
<s>   then he would walk with <abvr> maylie
and rose and hear them talk of books </s>
<s>  or perhaps sit near them in
some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read </s>
<s>  which he could
have done until it grew too dark to see the letters </s>
<s>  then he had his
own lesson for the next day to prepare </s>
<s>  and at this he would work
hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came
slowly on when the ladies would walk out again and he with them </s>
<s> 
listening with such pleasure to all they said </s>
<s>   and so happy if they
wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything
he could run to fetch </s>
<s>  that he could never be quick enough about it </s>
<s> 
when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would
sit down to the piano and play some pleasant air or sing in a low
and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear </s>
<s> 
there would be no candles lighted at such times as these </s>
<s>  and oliver
would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music in a
perfect rapture </s>
<s> 

and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from any way
in which he had ever spent it yet </s>
<s>  and how happily too </s>
<s>  like all the
other days in that most happy time </s>
<s>   there was the little church in
the morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows </s>
<s>   the
birds singing without </s>
<s>   and the sweetsmelling air stealing in at the
low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance </s>
<s>  the poor
people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that
it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there
together </s>
<s>  and though the singing might be rude it was real and
sounded more musical to olivers ears at least than any he had ever
heard in church before </s>
<s>   then there were the walks as usual and many
calls at the clean houses of the labouring men </s>
<s>  and at night oliver
read a </s>
<s> or two from the bible which he had been studying all
the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and
pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself </s>
<s> 

in the morning oliver would be afoot by six oclock roaming the
fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild
flowers with which he would return laden home </s>
<s>  and which it took
great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the
embellishment of the breakfasttable </s>
<s>  there was fresh groundsel too
for miss maylies birds with which oliver who had been studying the
subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the
cages in the most approved taste </s>
<s>  when the birds were made all spruce
and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of
charity to execute in the village </s>
<s>  or failing that there was rare
cricketplaying sometimes on the green </s>
<s>  or failing that there was
always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which
oliver who had studied this science also under the same master who
was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty goodwill until
miss rose made her appearance </s>
<s>   when there were a thousand
commendations to be bestowed on all he had done </s>
<s> 

so three months glided away </s>
<s>  three months which in the life of the
most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been unmingled
happiness and which in olivers were true felicity </s>
<s>  with the purest
and most amiable generosity on one side </s>
<s>  and the truest warmest
soulfelt gratitude on the other </s>
<s>  it is no wonder that by the end of
that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with
the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his
young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment
to himself </s>

check

spring flew swiftly by and summer came </s>

beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
richness </s>

earlier months had now burst into strong life and health </s>

home </s>

it they heard a sound as if she were weeping </s>

<s>  interposed <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>   oh not ill </s>
<s>  replied rose </s>
<s>  shuddering as though some deadly
chillness were passing over her while she spoke </s>
<s>  i shall be better
presently </s>
<s>   close the window pray </s>
<s> 

oliver hastened to comply with her request </s>
<s>   the young lady making an
effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune </s>
<s> 
but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys </s>
<s>  covering her face with
her hands she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the tears which she
was now unable to repress </s>
<s> 

my child </s>
<s>  said the elderly lady folding her arms about her i never
saw you so before </s>
<s> 

i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose </s>
<s>  but indeed
i have tried very hard and cannot help this </s>
<s>  i fear i am ill aunt </s>
<s> 

she was indeed </s>
<s>  for when candles were brought they saw that in the
very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of
her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness </s>
<s>  its expression had
lost nothing of its beauty </s>
<s>  but it was changed </s>
<s>  and there was an
anxious haggard look about the gentle face which it had never worn
before </s>
<s>   another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush </s>
<s>   and
a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye </s>
<s>   again this disappeared
like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud </s>
<s>  and she was once more deadly
pale </s>
<s> 

oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was
alarmed by these appearances </s>
<s>  and so in truth was he </s>
<s>  but seeing that
she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and
they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to
retire for the night she was in better spirits </s>
<s>  and appeared even in
better health </s>
<s>   assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in
the morning quite well </s>
<s> 

i hope said oliver when <abvr> maylie returned that nothing is the
matter </s>
<s>   she dont look well tonight but

the old lady motioned to him not to speak </s>
<s>  and sitting herself down in
a dark corner of the room remained silent for some time </s>
<s>  at length
she said in a trembling voice </s>
<s> 

i hope not oliver </s>
<s>   i have been very happy with her for some years </s>
<s> 
too happy perhaps </s>
<s>   it may be time that i should meet with some
misfortune </s>
<s>  but i hope it is not this </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s> 

the heavy blow said the old lady of losing the dear girl who has
so long been my comfort and happiness </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>   god forbid </s>
<s>  exclaimed oliver hastily </s>
<s> 

amen to that my child </s>
<s>  said the old lady wringing her hands </s>
<s> 

surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful </s>
<s>  said oliver </s>
<s>  two
hours ago she was quite well </s>
<s> 

she is very ill now rejoined <abvr> maylies </s>
<s>  and will be worse i am
sure </s>
<s>   my dear dear rose </s>
<s>   oh what shall i do without her </s>
<s> 

she gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own
emotion ventured to remonstrate with her </s>
<s>  and to beg earnestly that
for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm </s>
<s> 

and consider maam said oliver as the tears forced themselves into
his eyes despite of his efforts to the contrary </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  consider how
young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all
about her </s>
<s>   i am surecertainquite certainthat for your sake who
are so good yourself </s>
<s>  and for her own </s>
<s>  and for the sake of all she
makes so happy </s>
<s>  she will not die </s>
<s>   heaven will never let her die so
young </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said <abvr> maylie laying her hand on olivers head </s>
<s>  you think
like a child poor boy </s>
<s>   but you teach me my duty notwithstanding </s>
<s>   i
had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned
for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
agony of separation from the objects of our love </s>
<s>   i have seen enough
too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared
to those that love them </s>
<s>  but this should give us comfort in our sorrow </s>
<s> 
for heaven is just </s>
<s>  and such things teach us impressively that there
is a brighter world than this </s>
<s>  and that the passage to it is speedy </s>
<s> 
gods will be done </s>
<s>   i love her </s>
<s>  and he knows how well </s>
<s> 

oliver was surprised to see that as <abvr> maylie said these words she
checked her lamentations as though by one effort </s>
<s>  and drawing herself
up as she spoke became composed and firm </s>
<s>   he was still more
astonished to find that this firmness lasted </s>
<s>  and that under all the
care and watching which ensued <abvr> maylie was ever ready and
collected </s>
<s>  performing all the duties which had devolved upon her
steadily and to all external appearances even cheerfully </s>
<s>   but he
was young and did not know what strong minds are capable of under
trying circumstances </s>
<s>   how should he when their possessors so seldom
know themselves </s>
<s> 

an anxious night ensued </s>
<s>   when morning came <abvr> maylies predictions
were but too well verified </s>
<s>   rose was in the first stage of a high and
dangerous fever </s>
<s> 

we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said
mrs </s>
<s>  maylie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into
his face </s>
<s>  this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to
mr </s>
<s>  losberne </s>
<s>   it must be carried to the markettown </s>
<s>  which is not more
than four miles off by the footpath across the field </s>
<s>   and thence
dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey </s>
<s>  the
people at the inn will undertake to do this </s>
<s>  and i can trust to you to
see it done i know </s>
<s> 

oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once </s>
<s> 

here is another letter said <abvr> maylie pausing to reflect </s>
<s>  but
whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i
scarcely know </s>
<s>   i would not forward it unless i feared the worst </s>
<s> 

is it for chertsey too maam </s>
<s>  inquired oliver </s>
<s>  impatient to execute
his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter </s>
<s> 

no replied the old lady giving it to him mechanically </s>
<s>  oliver
glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry maylie esquire
at some great lords house in the country </s>
<s>  where he could not make out </s>
<s> 

shall it go maam </s>
<s>  asked oliver looking up impatiently </s>
<s> 

i think not replied <abvr> maylie taking it back </s>
<s>   i will wait until
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off
without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster </s>
<s> 

swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which
sometimes divided them </s>
<s>  now almost hidden by the high corn on either
side and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers
were busy at their work </s>
<s>   nor did he stop once save now and then for
a few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and
covered with dust on the little marketplace of the markettown </s>
<s> 

here he paused and looked about for the inn </s>
<s>   there were a white bank
and a red brewery and a yellow townhall </s>
<s>  and in one corner there was
a large house with all the wood about it painted green </s>
<s>   before which
was the sign of the george </s>
<s>   to this he hastened as soon as it
caught his eye </s>
<s> 

he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway </s>
<s>  and who after
hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler </s>
<s>  who after hearing
all he had to say again referred him to the landlord </s>
<s>  who was a tall
gentleman in a blue neckcloth a white hat drab breeches and boots
with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stabledoor picking
his teeth with a silver toothpick </s>
<s> 

this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out
the bill </s>
<s>   which took a long time making out </s>
<s>   and after it was ready
and paid a horse had to be saddled and a man to be dressed which
took up ten good minutes more </s>
<s>   meanwhile oliver was in such a
desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could
have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to
the next stage </s>
<s>   at length all was ready </s>
<s>  and the little parcel having
been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy
delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven
paving of the marketplace was out of the town and galloping along
the turnpikeroad in a couple of minutes </s>
<s> 

as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and
that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the innyard with a
somewhat lighter heart </s>
<s>   he was turning out of the gateway when he
accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak who was at
that moment coming out of the inn door </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly
recoiling </s>
<s>   what the devils this </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon sir said oliver </s>
<s>  i was in a great hurry to get
home and didnt see you were coming </s>
<s> 

death </s>
<s>  muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large
dark eyes </s>
<s>   who would have thought it </s>
<s>  grind him to ashes </s>
<s>  hed start
up from a stone coffin to come in my way </s>
<s> 

i am sorry stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild
look </s>
<s>   i hope i have not hurt you </s>
<s> 

rot you </s>
<s>  murmured the man in a horrible passion </s>
<s>  between his
clenched teeth </s>
<s>  if i had only had the courage to say the word i might
have been free of you in a night </s>
<s>   curses on your head and black death
on your heart you imp </s>
<s>   what are you doing here </s>
<s> 

the man shook his fist as he uttered these words incoherently </s>
<s>  he
advanced towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at
him but fell violently on the ground </s>
<s>   writhing and foaming in a fit </s>
<s> 

oliver gazed for a moment at the struggles of the madman for such he
supposed him to be </s>
<s>  and then darted into the house for help </s>
<s>   having
seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards
running as fast as he could to make up for lost time </s>
<s>   and recalling
with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary
behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted </s>
<s> 

the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however </s>
<s>  for
when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and
to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory </s>
<s> 

rose maylie had rapidly grown worse </s>
<s>  before midnight she was
delirious </s>
<s>   a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in
constant attendance upon her </s>
<s>  and after first seeing the patient he
had taken <abvr> maylie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a
most alarming nature </s>
<s>  in fact he said it would be little short of
a miracle if she recovered </s>
<s> 

how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out
with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest
sound from the sick chamber </s>
<s>   how often did a tremble shake his frame
and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling
of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had
even then occurred </s>
<s>   and what had been the fervency of all the prayers
he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the
agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the
gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by
while the life of one we dearly love is trembling in the balance </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s> 
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heart beat
violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they
conjure up before it </s>
<s>  the desperate anxiety to be doing something to
relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to
alleviate </s>
<s>  the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of
our helplessness produces </s>
<s>  what tortures can equal these </s>
<s>  what
reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the time
allay them </s>
<s> 

morning came </s>
<s>  and the little cottage was lonely and still </s>
<s>  people spoke
in whispers </s>
<s>  anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time </s>
<s> 
women and children went away in tears </s>
<s>  all the livelong day and for
hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the
garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and
shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay
stretched inside </s>
<s>   late that night <abvr> losberne arrived </s>
<s>   it is
hard said the good doctor turning away as he spoke </s>
<s>  so young </s>
<s>  so
much beloved </s>
<s>  but there is very little hope </s>
<s> 

another morning </s>
<s>   the sun shone brightly </s>
<s>  as brightly as if it looked
upon no misery or care </s>
<s>  and with every leaf and flower in full bloom
about her </s>
<s>  with life and health and sounds and sights of joy
surrounding her on every side </s>
<s>  the fair young creature lay wasting
fast </s>
<s>   oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one
of the green mounds wept and prayed for her in silence </s>
<s> 

there was such peace and beauty in the scene </s>
<s>  so much of brightness and
mirth in the sunny landscape </s>
<s>  such blithesome music in the songs of the
summer birds </s>
<s>  such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering
overhead </s>
<s>  so much of life and joyousness in all </s>
<s>  that when the boy
raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively
occurred to him that this was not a time for death </s>
<s>  that rose could
surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay </s>
<s>  that
graves were for cold and cheerless winter </s>
<s>   not for sunlight and
fragrance </s>
<s>  he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
shrunken </s>
<s>  and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in
their ghastly folds </s>
<s> 

a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts </s>
<s> 
another </s>
<s>   again </s>
<s>   it was tolling for the funeral service </s>
<s>   a group of
humble mourners entered the gate </s>
<s>  wearing white favours </s>
<s>  for the corpse
was young </s>
<s>   they stood uncovered by a grave </s>
<s>  and there was a mothera
mother onceamong the weeping train </s>
<s>   but the sun shone brightly and
the birds sang on </s>
<s> 

oliver turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received
from the young lady and wishing that the time could come again that
he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was </s>
<s>   he
had no cause for selfreproach on the score of neglect or want of
thought for he had been devoted to her service </s>
<s>  and yet a hundred
little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have
been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been </s>
<s>   we need
be careful how we deal with those about us when every death carries to
some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so
little doneof so many things forgotten and so many more which might
have been repaired </s>
<s>   there is no remorse so deep as that which is
unavailing </s>
<s>  if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this
in time </s>
<s> 

when he reached home <abvr> maylie was sitting in the little parlour </s>
<s> 
olivers heart sank at sight of her </s>
<s>  for she had never left the bedside
of her niece </s>
<s>  and he trembled to think what change could have driven
her away </s>
<s>   he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which
she would waken either to recovery and life or to bid them farewell
and die </s>
<s> 

they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours </s>
<s>   the untasted meal
was removed with looks which showed that their thoughts were
elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at
length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his
departure </s>
<s>   their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep </s>
<s>   they both involuntarily darted to the door as <abvr> losberne
entered </s>
<s> 

what of rose </s>
<s>  cried the old lady </s>
<s>   tell me at once </s>
<s>   i can bear it </s>
<s> 
anything but suspense </s>
<s>   oh tell me </s>
<s>  in the name of heaven </s>
<s> 

you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her </s>
<s>  be calm
my dear maam pray </s>
<s> 

let me go in gods name </s>

<s>   she is dead </s>
<s>  she is dying </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  cried the doctor passionately </s>
<s>   as he is good and merciful she
will live to bless us all for years to come </s>
<s> 

the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together </s>
<s>  but
the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her
first thanksgiving </s>
<s>  and she sank into the friendly arms which were
extended to receive her </s>

chapter xxxiv

contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman
who now arrives upon the scene </s>
<s>  and a new adventure which happened to
oliver

it was almost too much happiness to bear </s>
<s>   oliver felt stunned and
stupefied by the unexpected intelligence </s>
<s>  he could not weep or speak
or rest </s>
<s>   he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of
tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a
full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast </s>
<s> 

the night was fast closing in when he returned homeward </s>
<s>   laden with
flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of
the sick chamber </s>
<s>   as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind
him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace </s>
<s>   looking
round he saw that it was a postchaise driven at great speed </s>
<s>  and as
the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning
against a gate until it should have passed him </s>
<s> 

as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap
whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that
he could not identify the person </s>
<s>   in another second or two the
nightcap was thrust out of the chaisewindow and a stentorian voice
bellowed to the driver to stop </s>
<s>   which he did as soon as he could pull
up his horses </s>
<s>   then the nightcap once again appeared </s>
<s>  and the same
voice called oliver by his name </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s>  cried the voice </s>
<s>   oliver whats the news </s>
<s>   miss rose </s>
<s>  master
oliver </s>
<s> 

is it you giles </s>
<s>  cried oliver running up to the chaisedoor </s>
<s> 

giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply
when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news </s>
<s> 

in a word </s>
<s>  cried the gentleman better or worse </s>
<s> 

bettermuch better </s>
<s>  replied oliver hastily </s>
<s> 

thank heaven </s>
<s>  exclaimed the gentleman </s>
<s>   you are sure </s>
<s> 

quite sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   the change took place only a few hours
ago </s>
<s>  and <abvr> losberne says that all danger is at an end </s>
<s> 

the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaisedoor
leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside </s>
<s> 

you are quite certain </s>
<s>   there is no possibility of any mistake on your
part my boy is there </s>
<s>  demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice </s>
<s> 
do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled </s>
<s> 

i would not for the world sir replied oliver </s>
<s>   indeed you may
believe me </s>
<s>   <abvr> losbernes words were that she would live to bless us
all for many years to come </s>
<s>   i heard him say so </s>
<s> 

the tears stood in olivers eyes as he recalled the scene which was the
beginning of so much happiness </s>
<s>  and the gentleman turned his face away
and remained silent for some minutes </s>
<s>   oliver thought he heard him
sob more than once </s>
<s>  but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh
remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood
apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay </s>
<s> 

all this time <abvr> giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting
on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and
wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pockethandkerchief dotted with
white spots </s>
<s>   that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was
abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the
young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him </s>
<s> 

i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles
said he </s>
<s>   i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time
before i see her </s>
<s>   you can say i am coming </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon <abvr> harry said giles </s>
<s>   giving a final polish to
his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief </s>
<s>  but if you would leave
the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you </s>
<s>   it
wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir </s>
<s>  i should
never have any more authority with them if they did </s>
<s> 

well rejoined harry maylie smiling you can do as you like </s>
<s>  let
him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us </s>
<s> 
only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering
or we shall be taken for madmen </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and
pocketed his nightcap </s>
<s>  and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape
which he took out of the chaise </s>
<s>   this done the postboy drove off </s>
<s> 
giles <abvr> maylie and oliver followed at their leisure </s>
<s> 

as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much
interest and curiosity at the new comer </s>
<s>   he seemed about
fiveandtwenty years of age and was of the middle height </s>
<s>  his
countenance was frank and handsome </s>
<s>  and his demeanor easy and
prepossessing </s>
<s>   notwithstanding the difference between youth and age
he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have
had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not
already spoken of her as his mother </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached
the cottage </s>
<s>   the meeting did not take place without great emotion on
both sides </s>
<s> 

mother </s>
<s>  whispered the young man </s>
<s>  why did you not write before </s>
<s> 

i did replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  but on reflection i determined to keep
back the letter until i had heard <abvr> losbernes opinion </s>
<s> 

but why said the young man why run the chance of that occurring
which so nearly happened </s>
<s>   if rose hadi cannot utter that word
nowif this illness had terminated differently how could you ever
have forgiven yourself </s>
<s>   how could i ever have know happiness again </s>
<s> 

if that had been the case harry said <abvr> maylie i fear your
happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival
here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little
import </s>
<s> 

and who can wonder if it be so mother </s>
<s>  rejoined the young man </s>
<s>  or
why should i say if </s>
<s> it isit isyou know it motheryou must
know it </s>
<s> 

i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
offer said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  i know that the devotion and affection of
her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and
lasting </s>
<s>   if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed
behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my
task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the
strict line of duty </s>
<s> 

this is unkind mother said harry </s>
<s>   do you still suppose that i am
a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own
soul </s>
<s> 

i think my dear son returned <abvr> maylie laying her hand upon his
shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last </s>
<s>  and
that among them are some which being gratified become only the more
fleeting </s>
<s>   above all i think said the lady fixing her eyes on her
sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a
wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no
fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and
upon his children also </s>
<s>  and in exact proportion to his success in the
world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against
him </s>
<s>   he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day
repent of the connection he formed in early life </s>
<s>   and she may have the
pain of knowing that he does so </s>
<s> 

mother said the young man impatiently he would be a selfish
brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe
who acted thus </s>
<s> 

you think so now harry replied his mother </s>
<s> 

and ever will </s>
<s>  said the young man </s>
<s>   the mental agony i have
suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of
a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i
have lightly formed </s>
<s>   on rose sweet gentle girl </s>
<s>  my heart is set as
firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman </s>
<s>   i have no thought no
view no hope in life beyond her </s>
<s>  and if you oppose me in this great
stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to
the wind </s>
<s>   mother think better of this and of me and do not
disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little </s>
<s> 

harry said <abvr> maylie it is because i think so much of warm and
sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded </s>
<s>  but we
have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now </s>
<s> 

let it rest with rose then interposed harry </s>
<s>   you will not press
these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle
in my way </s>
<s> 

i will not rejoined <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  but i would have you consider

i have considered </s>
<s>  was the impatient reply </s>
<s>  mother i have
considered years and years </s>
<s>   i have considered ever since i have been
capable of serious reflection </s>
<s>   my feelings remain unchanged as they
ever will </s>
<s>  and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them
vent which can be productive of no earthly good </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   before i leave
this place rose shall hear me </s>
<s> 

she shall said <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she
will hear me coldly mother said the young man </s>
<s> 

not coldly rejoined the old lady </s>
<s>  far from it </s>
<s> 

how then </s>
<s>  urged the young man </s>
<s>   she has formed no other attachment </s>
<s> 

no indeed replied his mother </s>
<s>  you have or i mistake too strong a
hold on her affections already </s>
<s>   what i would say resumed the old
lady stopping her son as he was about to speak is this </s>
<s>   before you
stake your all on this chance </s>
<s>  before you suffer yourself to be carried
to the highest point of hope </s>
<s>  reflect for a few moments my dear child
on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her
doubtful birth may have on her decision </s>
<s>   devoted as she is to us with
all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of
self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her
characteristic </s>
<s>

that i leave you to discover replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>   i must go back
to her </s>
<s>   god bless you </s>
<s> 

i shall see you again tonight </s>
<s>  said the young man eagerly </s>
<s> 

by and by replied the lady </s>
<s>  when i leave rose </s>
<s> 

you will tell her i am here </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s> 

of course replied <abvr> maylie </s>
<s> 

and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how
i long to see her </s>
<s>   you will not refuse to do this mother </s>
<s> 

no said the old lady </s>
<s>  i will tell her all </s>
<s>   and pressing her sons
hand affectionately she hastened from the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment
while this hurried conversation was proceeding </s>
<s>   the former now held
out his hand to harry maylie </s>
<s>  and hearty salutations were exchanged
between them </s>
<s>   the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious
questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients
situation </s>
<s>  which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as
olivers statement had encouraged him to hope </s>
<s>  and to the whole of
which <abvr> giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened
with greedy ears </s>
<s> 

have you shot anything particular lately giles </s>
<s>  inquired the
doctor when he had concluded </s>
<s> 

nothing particular sir replied <abvr> giles colouring up to the eyes </s>
<s> 

nor catching any thieves nor identifying any housebreakers </s>
<s>  said
the doctor </s>
<s> 

none at all sir replied <abvr> giles with much gravity </s>
<s> 

well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that
sort of thing admirably </s>
<s>   pray how is brittles </s>
<s> 

the boy is very well sir said <abvr> giles recovering his usual tone
of patronage </s>
<s>  and sends his respectful duty sir </s>
<s> 

thats well said the doctor </s>
<s>   seeing you here reminds me <abvr>
giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so
hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small
commission in your favour </s>
<s>   just step into this corner a moment will
you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder
and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on
the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with
steps of unusual stateliness </s>
<s>   the subject matter of this conference
was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily
enlightened concerning it </s>
<s>  for <abvr> giles walked straight thither and
having called for a mug of ale announced with an air of majesty
which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in
consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that
attempted robbery to deposit in the local savingsbank the sum of
fiveandtwenty pounds for his sole use and benefit </s>
<s>   at this the two
womenservants lifted up their hands and eyes and supposed that <abvr>
giles pulling out his shirtfrill replied no no </s>
<s>  and that if they
observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank
them to tell him so </s>
<s>   and then he made a great many other remarks no
less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal
favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the
purpose as the remarks of great men commonly are </s>
<s> 

above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away </s>
<s>  for
the doctor was in high spirits </s>
<s>  and however fatigued or thoughtful
harry maylie might have been at first he was not proof against the
worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great
variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of
small jokes which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had
ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately </s>
<s>  to the evident
satisfaction of the doctor who laughed immoderately at himself and
made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy </s>
<s> 
so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they
could well have been </s>
<s>  and it was late before they retired with light
and thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and
suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need </s>
<s> 

oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual
occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many
days </s>
<s>   the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places </s>
<s> 
and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more
gathered to gladden rose with their beauty </s>
<s>  the melancholy which had
seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over
every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic </s>
<s>   the dew
seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves </s>
<s>  the air to rustle
among them with a sweeter music </s>
<s>  and the sky itself to look more blue
and bright </s>
<s>  such is the influence which the condition of our own
thoughts exercise even over the appearance of external objects </s>
<s>   men
who look on nature and their fellowmen and cry that all is dark and
gloomy are in the right </s>
<s>  but the sombre colours are reflections from
their own jaundiced eyes and hearts </s>
<s>   the real hues are delicate and
need a clearer vision </s>
<s> 

it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time
that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone </s>
<s>  harry maylie
after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home was
seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in
their arrangement as left his young companion far behind </s>
<s>   if oliver
were behindhand in these respects he knew where the best were to be
found </s>
<s>  and morning after morning they scoured the country together and
brought home the fairest that blossomed </s>
<s>   the window of the young
ladys chamber was opened now </s>
<s>  for she loved to feel the rich summer
air stream in and revive her with its freshness </s>
<s>  but there always
stood in water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch
which was made up with great care every morning </s>
<s>   oliver could not
help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away
although the little vase was regularly replenished </s>
<s>  nor could he help
observing that whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably
cast his eyes up to that particular corner and nodded his head most
expressively as he set forth on his mornings walk </s>
<s>   pending these
observations the days were flying by </s>
<s>  and rose was rapidly recovering </s>
<s> 

nor did olivers time hang heavy on his hands although the young lady
had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now
and then for a short distance with <abvr> maylie </s>
<s>  he applied himself
with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the whiteheaded old
gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even
himself </s>
<s>   it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was
greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence </s>
<s> 

the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his
books was on the groundfloor at the back of the house </s>
<s>   it was quite
a cottageroom with a latticewindow </s>
<s>  around which were clusters of
jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the
place with their delicious perfume </s>
<s>   it looked into a garden whence a
wicketgate opened into a small paddock </s>
<s>  all beyond was fine
meadowland and wood </s>
<s>   there was no other dwelling near in that
direction </s>
<s>  and the prospect it commanded was very extensive </s>
<s> 

one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning
to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his
books </s>
<s>   he had been poring over them for some time </s>
<s>  and as the day had
been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is
no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say
that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep </s>
<s> 

there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it
holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things
about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure </s>
<s>   so far as an
overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called
sleep this is it </s>
<s>  and yet we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us and if we dream at such a time words which are
really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate
themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and
imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
matter of impossibility to separate the two </s>
<s>   nor is this the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state </s>
<s>   it is an undoubted
fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead
yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before
us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent
presence of some external object </s>
<s>  which may not have been near us when
we closed our eyes </s>
<s>   and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
consciousness </s>
<s> 

oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room </s>
<s>  that
his books were lying on the table before him </s>
<s>  that the sweet air was
stirring among the creeping plants outside </s>
<s>   and yet he was asleep </s>
<s> 
suddenly the scene changed </s>
<s>  the air became close and confined </s>
<s>  and he
thought with a glow of terror that he was in the jews house again </s>
<s> 
there sat the hideous old man in his accustomed corner pointing at
him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat
beside him </s>
<s> 

hush my dear </s>
<s>  he thought he heard the jew say </s>
<s>  it is he sure
enough </s>
<s>   come away </s>
<s> 

he </s>
<s>  the other man seemed to answer </s>
<s>  could i mistake him think you </s>
<s> 
if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and
he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to
point him out </s>
<s>   if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across
his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that
he lay buried there </s>
<s> 

the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver
awoke with the fear and started up </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>   what was that which sent the blood tingling to his
heart and deprived him of his voice and of power to move </s>
<s> 
therethereat the windowclose before himso close that he could
have almost touched him before he started back </s>
<s>   with his eyes peering
into the room and meeting his </s>
<s>   there stood the jew </s>
<s>   and beside him
white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the man
who had accosted him in the innyard </s>
<s> 

it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes </s>
<s>  and they
were gone </s>
<s>   but they had recognised him and he them </s>
<s>  and their look
was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply
carved in stone and set before him from his birth </s>
<s>  he stood transfixed
for a moment </s>
<s>  then leaping from the window into the garden called
loudly for help </s>
<s> 



chapter xxxv

containing the unsatisfactory result of olivers adventure </s>
<s>  and a
conversation of some importance between harry maylie and rose

when the inmates of the house attracted by olivers cries hurried to
the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated
pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house and scarcely
able to articulate the words the jew </s>
<s>  the jew </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant </s>
<s>  but harry
maylie whose perceptions were something quicker and who had heard
olivers history from his mother understood it at once </s>
<s> 

what direction did he take </s>
<s>  he asked catching up a heavy stick which
was standing in a corner </s>
<s> 

that replied oliver pointing out the course the man had taken </s>
<s>  i
missed them in an instant </s>
<s> 

then they are in the ditch </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s>   follow </s>
<s>   and keep as near
me as you can </s>
<s>  so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off
with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
others to keep near him </s>
<s> 

giles followed as well as he could </s>
<s>  and oliver followed too </s>
<s>  and in the
course of a minute or two <abvr> losberne who had been out walking and
just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking
himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to
possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting
all the while most prodigiously to know what was the matter </s>
<s> 

on they all went </s>
<s>  nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader
striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver began to
search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining </s>
<s>  which afforded time
for the remainder of the party to come up </s>
<s>  and for oliver to
communicate to <abvr> losberne the circumstances that had led to so
vigorous a pursuit </s>
<s> 

the search was all in vain </s>
<s>   there were not even the traces of recent
footsteps to be seen </s>
<s>   they stood now on the summit of a little hill
commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles </s>
<s> 
there was the village in the hollow on the left </s>
<s>  but in order to gain
that after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out the men must
have made a circuit of open ground which it was impossible they could
have accomplished in so short a time </s>
<s>   a thick wood skirted the
meadowland in another direction </s>
<s>  but they could not have gained that
covert for the same reason </s>
<s> 

it must have been a dream oliver said harry maylie </s>
<s> 

oh no indeed sir replied oliver shuddering at the very
recollection of the old wretchs countenance </s>
<s>  i saw him too plainly
for that </s>
<s>   i saw them both as plainly as i see you now </s>
<s> 

who was the other </s>
<s>  inquired harry and <abvr> losberne together </s>
<s> 

the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the
inn said oliver </s>
<s>   we had our eyes fixed full upon each other </s>
<s>  and i
could swear to him </s>
<s> 

they took this way </s>
<s>  demanded harry </s>
<s>   are you sure </s>
<s> 

as i am that the men were at the window replied oliver pointing
down as he spoke to the hedge which divided the cottagegarden from
the meadow </s>
<s>   the tall man leaped over just there </s>
<s>  and the jew
running a few paces to the right crept through that gap </s>
<s> 

the two gentlemen watched olivers earnest face as he spoke and
looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he said </s>
<s>   still in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight </s>
<s>   the grass was
long </s>
<s>  but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own feet had
crushed it </s>
<s>   the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay </s>
<s>  but
in no one place could they discern the print of mens shoes or the
slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
ground for hours before </s>
<s> 

this is strange </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s> 

strange </s>
<s>  echoed the doctor </s>
<s>   blathers and duff themselves could
make nothing of it </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did
not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further
prosecution hopeless </s>
<s>  and even then they gave it up with reluctance </s>
<s> 
giles was dispatched to the different alehouses in the village
furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance
and dress of the strangers </s>
<s>   of these the jew was at all events
sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen
drinking or loitering about </s>
<s>  but giles returned without any
intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery </s>
<s> 

on the next day fresh search was made and the inquiries renewed </s>
<s>  but
with no better success </s>
<s>   on the day following oliver and <abvr> maylie
repaired to the markettown in the hope of seeing or hearing something
of the men there </s>
<s>  but this effort was equally fruitless </s>
<s>   after a few
days the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when
wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself </s>
<s> 

meanwhile rose was rapidly recovering </s>
<s>   she had left her room </s>
<s>  was
able to go out </s>
<s>  and mixing once more with the family carried joy into
the hearts of all </s>
<s> 

but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
circle </s>
<s>  and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more
heard in the cottage </s>
<s>  there was at times an unwonted restraint upon
some there </s>
<s>   even upon rose herself </s>
<s>  which oliver could not fail to
remark </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie and her son were often closeted together for a
long time </s>
<s>  and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon
her face </s>
<s>   after <abvr> losberne had fixed a day for his departure to
chertsey these symptoms increased </s>
<s>  and it became evident that
something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady
and of somebody else besides </s>
<s> 

at length one morning when rose was alone in the breakfastparlour
harry maylie entered </s>
<s>  and with some hesitation begged permission to
speak with her for a few moments </s>
<s> 

a fewa very fewwill suffice rose said the young man drawing
his chair towards her </s>
<s>   what i shall have to say has already
presented itself to your mind </s>
<s>  the most cherished hopes of my heart are
not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated </s>
<s> 

rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance </s>
<s>  but that might
have been the effect of her recent illness </s>
<s>   she merely bowed </s>
<s>  and
bending over some plants that stood near waited in silence for him to
proceed </s>
<s> 

iiought to have left here before said harry </s>
<s> 

you should indeed replied rose </s>
<s>   forgive me for saying so but i
wish you had </s>
<s> 

i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all
apprehensions said the young man </s>
<s>  the fear of losing the one dear
being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed </s>
<s>   you had been dying </s>
<s> 
trembling between earth and heaven </s>
<s>   we know that when the young the
beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits
insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest </s>
<s>  we know
heaven help us </s>
<s>  that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade
in blooming </s>
<s> 

there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl as these words were
spoken </s>
<s>  and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent and
glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as
though the outpouring of her fresh young heart claimed kindred
naturally with the loveliest things in nature </s>
<s> 

a creature continued the young man passionately a creature as
fair and innocent of guile as one of gods own angels fluttered
between life and death </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  who could hope when the distant world to
which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to
the sorrow and calamity of this </s>
<s>   rose rose to know that you were
passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts
upon the earth </s>
<s>  to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
linger here </s>
<s>  hardly to know a reason why you should be </s>
<s>  to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
the best have winged their early flight </s>
<s>  and yet to pray amid all
these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved
youthese were distractions almost too great to bear </s>
<s>  they were mine
by day and night </s>
<s>  and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears
and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never
know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in
its course </s>
<s>   you recovered </s>
<s>  day by day and almost hour by hour some
drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a
high and rushing tide </s>
<s>   i have watched you change almost from death to
life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
affection </s>
<s>  do not tell me that you wish i had lost this </s>
<s>  for it has
softened my heart to all mankind </s>
<s> 

i did not mean that said rose weeping </s>
<s>  i only wish you had left
here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again </s>
<s>  to
pursuits well worthy of you </s>
<s> 

there is no pursuit more worthy of me </s>
<s>   more worthy of the highest
nature that exists </s>
<s>   than the struggle to win such a heart as yours
said the young man taking her hand </s>
<s>  rose my own dear rose </s>
<s>   for
yearsfor yearsi have loved you </s>
<s>  hoping to win my way to fame and
then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to
share </s>
<s>  thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy
moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boys attachment
and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that
had been sealed between us </s>
<s>   that time has not arrived </s>
<s>  but here with
not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so
long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the
offer </s>
<s> 

your behaviour has ever been kind and noble </s>
<s>  said rose mastering the
emotions by which she was agitated </s>
<s>   as you believe that i am not
insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer </s>
<s> 

it is that i may endeavour to deserve you </s>
<s>  it is dear rose </s>
<s> 

it is replied rose that you must endeavour to forget me </s>
<s>  not as
your old and dearlyattached companion for that would wound me deeply </s>
<s> 
but as the object of your love </s>
<s>   look into the world </s>
<s>  think how many
hearts you would be proud to gain are there </s>
<s>  confide some other
passion to me if you will </s>
<s>  i will be the truest warmest and most
faithful friend you have </s>
<s> 

there was a pause during which rose who had covered her face with
one hand gave free vent to her tears </s>
<s>   harry still retained the other </s>
<s> 

and your reasons rose he said at length in a low voice </s>
<s>  your
reasons for this decision </s>
<s> 

you have a right to know them rejoined rose </s>
<s>   you can say nothing
to alter my resolution </s>
<s>   it is a duty that i must perform </s>
<s>   i owe it
alike to others and to myself </s>
<s> 

to yourself </s>
<s> 

yes harry </s>
<s>   i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless
girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason
to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and
fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects </s>
<s>   i owe it to
you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your
generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world </s>
<s> 

if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty harry began </s>
<s> 

they do not replied rose colouring deeply </s>
<s> 

then you return my love </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s>   say but that dear rose </s>
<s>  say
but that </s>
<s>  and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment </s>
<s> 

if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved
rejoined rose i could have

have received this declaration very differently </s>
<s>  said harry </s>
<s>  do not
conceal that from me at least rose </s>
<s> 

i could said rose </s>
<s>   stay </s>
<s>  she added disengaging her hand why
should we prolong this painful interview </s>
<s>   most painful to me and yet
productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding </s>
<s>  for it will be
happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which
i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me
with new fortitude and firmness </s>
<s>   farewell harry </s>
<s>   as we have met
today we meet no more </s>
<s>  but in other relations than those in which
this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined </s>
<s> 
and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can
call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper
you </s>
<s> 

another word rose said harry </s>
<s>   your reason in your own words </s>
<s> 
from your own lips let me hear it </s>
<s> 

the prospect before you answered rose firmly is a brilliant one </s>
<s> 
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can
help men in public life are in store for you </s>
<s>  but those connections
are proud </s>
<s>  and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the
mother who gave me life </s>
<s>  nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of
her who has so well supplied that mothers place </s>
<s>   in a word said the
young lady turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there
is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads </s>
<s>   i
will carry it into no blood but my own </s>
<s>  and the reproach shall rest
alone on me </s>
<s> 

one word more rose </s>
<s>   dearest rose </s>
<s>  one more </s>
<s>  cried harry throwing
himself before her </s>
<s>   if i had been lessless fortunate the world
would call itif some obscure and peaceful life had been my
destinyif i had been poor sick helplesswould you have turned from
me then </s>
<s>   or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given
this scruple birth </s>
<s> 

do not press me to reply answered rose </s>
<s>   the question does not
arise and never will </s>
<s>   it is unfair almost unkind to urge it </s>
<s> 

if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted harry
it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the
path before me </s>
<s>   it is not an idle thing to do so much by the
utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else </s>
<s> 
oh rose </s>
<s>  in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment </s>
<s>  in the name
of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo </s>
<s>  answer
me this one question </s>
<s> 

then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined rose </s>
<s>  if you
had been even a little but not so far above me </s>
<s>  if i could have been
a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement
and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds </s>
<s>  i
should have been spared this trial </s>
<s>   i have every reason to be happy
very happy now </s>
<s>  but then harry i own i should have been happier </s>
<s> 

busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a girl long ago crowded
into the mind of rose while making this avowal </s>
<s>  but they brought tears
with them as old hopes will when they come back withered </s>
<s>  and they
relieved her </s>
<s> 

i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said
rose extending her hand </s>
<s>   i must leave you now indeed </s>
<s> 

i ask one promise said harry </s>
<s>   once and only once moresay
within a year but it may be much sooneri may speak to you again on
this subject for the last time </s>
<s> 

not to press me to alter my right determination replied rose with a
melancholy smile </s>
<s>  it will be useless </s>
<s> 

no said harry </s>
<s>  to hear you repeat it if you willfinally repeat
it </s>
<s>   i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may
possess </s>
<s>  and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not
seek by word or act to change it </s>
<s> 

then let it be so rejoined rose </s>
<s>  it is but one pang the more and
by that time i may be enabled to bear it better </s>
<s> 

she extended her hand again </s>
<s>   but the young man caught her to his
bosom </s>
<s>  and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead hurried from
the room </s>

chapter xxxvi

is a very short one and may appear of no great importance in its
place but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last

thats a fine fellow said the doctor </s>

when you return </s>

gone </s>
<s> 

the great nobs replied harry under which designation i presume
you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at
all since i have been here </s>
<s>  nor at this time of the year is it
likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate
attendance among them </s>

well said the doctor you are a queer fellow </s>

these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political
life </s>

harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue

pursued the subject no farther </s>

chapter xxxvii

in which the reader may perceive a contrast not uncommon in
matrimonial cases

mr </s>
<s>  bumble sat in the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on
the cheerless grate whence as it was summer time no brighter gleam
proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which
were sent back from its cold and shining surface </s>
<s>   a paper flycage
dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in
gloomy thought </s>
<s>  and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy
network <abvr> bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy
shadow overspread his countenance </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was meditating </s>
<s>  it might
be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own
past life </s>
<s> 

nor was <abvr> bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator </s>
<s>  there were not wanting
other appearances and those closely connected with his own person
which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of
his affairs </s>
<s>   the laced coat and the cocked hat </s>
<s>  where were they </s>
<s>   he
still wore kneebreeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether
limbs </s>
<s>  but they were not the breeches </s>
<s>   the coat was wideskirted </s>
<s> 
and in that respect like the coat but oh how different </s>
<s>   the mighty
cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble was no
longer a beadle </s>
<s> 

there are some promotions in life which independent of the more
substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from
the coats and waistcoats connected with them </s>
<s>   a fieldmarshal has his
uniform </s>
<s>  a bishop his silk apron </s>
<s>  a counsellor his silk gown </s>
<s>  a beadle
his cocked hat </s>
<s>   strip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his
hat and lace </s>
<s>  what are they </s>
<s>   men </s>
<s>   mere men </s>
<s>   dignity and even
holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than
some people imagine </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had married <abvr> corney and was master of the workhouse </s>
<s> 
another beadle had come into power </s>
<s>   on him the cocked hat goldlaced
coat and staff had all three descended </s>
<s> 

and tomorrow two months it was done </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble with a sigh </s>
<s> 
it seems a age </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence
of happiness into the short space of eight weeks </s>
<s>  but the sighthere
was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh </s>
<s> 

i sold myself said <abvr> bumble pursuing the same train of relection
for six teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a milkpot </s>
<s>  with a small
quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money </s>
<s>   i went
very reasonable </s>
<s>   cheap dirt cheap </s>
<s> 

cheap </s>
<s>  cried a shrill voice in <abvr> bumbles ear </s>
<s>  you would have been
dear at any price </s>
<s>  and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows
that </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort
who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his
complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bumble maam </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble with a sentimental sternness </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  cried the lady </s>
<s> 

have the goodness to look at me said <abvr> bumble fixing his eyes
upon her </s>
<s>   if she stands such a eye as that said <abvr> bumble to
himself she can stand anything </s>
<s>   it is a eye i never knew to fail
with paupers </s>
<s>   if it fails with her my power is gone </s>
<s> 

whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition </s>
<s>  or
whether the late <abvr> corney was particularly proof against eagle
glances </s>
<s>  are matters of opinion </s>
<s>   the matter of fact is that the
matron was in no way overpowered by <abvr> bumbles scowl but on the
contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh
thereat which sounded as though it were genuine </s>
<s> 

on hearing this most unexpected sound <abvr> bumble looked first
incredulous and afterwards amazed </s>
<s>   he then relapsed into his former
state </s>
<s>  nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened
by the voice of his partner </s>
<s> 

are you going to sit snoring there all day </s>
<s>  inquired <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

i am going to sit here as long as i think proper maam rejoined
mr </s>
<s>  bumble </s>
<s>  and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape
sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me </s>
<s>  such being my
prerogative </s>
<s> 

your prerogative </s>
<s>  sneered <abvr> bumble with ineffable contempt </s>
<s> 

i said the word maam said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   the prerogative of a man
is to command </s>
<s> 

and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness </s>
<s>  cried
the relict of <abvr> corney deceased </s>
<s> 

to obey maam thundered <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   your late unfortunate husband
should have taught it you </s>
<s>  and then perhaps he might have been alive
now </s>
<s>   i wish he was poor man </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now
arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or
other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this
allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with
a loud scream that <abvr> bumble was a hardhearted brute fell into a
paroxysm of tears </s>
<s> 

but tears were not the things to find their way to <abvr> bumbles soul </s>
<s> 
his heart was waterproof </s>
<s>   like washable beaver hats that improve with
rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of
tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of
his own power pleased and exalted him </s>
<s>   he eyed his good lady with
looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that
she should cry her hardest </s>
<s>   the exercise being looked upon by the
faculty as strongly conducive to health </s>
<s> 

it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and
softens down the temper said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   so cry away </s>
<s> 

as he discharged himself of this pleasantry <abvr> bumble took his hat
from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on one side as a man
might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner
thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with
much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> corney that was had tried the tears because they were less
troublesome than a manual assault </s>
<s>  but she was quite prepared to make
trial of the latter mode of proceeding as <abvr> bumble was not long in
discovering </s>
<s> 

the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow
sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
opposite end of the room </s>
<s>   this preliminary proceeding laying bare his
head the expert lady clasping him tightly round the throat with one
hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and
dexterity upon it with the other </s>
<s>   this done she created a little
variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair </s>
<s>  and having by
this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the
offence she pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated
for the purpose </s>
<s>   and defied him to talk about his prerogative again
if he dared </s>
<s> 

get up </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble in a voice of command </s>
<s>   and take yourself
away from here unless you want me to do something desperate </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble rose with a very rueful countenance </s>
<s>   wondering much what
something desperate might be </s>
<s>   picking up his hat he looked towards
the door </s>
<s> 

are you going </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear certainly rejoined <abvr> bumble making a quicker
motion towards the door </s>
<s>   i didnt intend toim going my dear </s>
<s>   you
are so very violent that really i

at this instant <abvr> bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble
immediately darted out of the room without bestowing another thought
on his unfinished sentence </s>
<s>   leaving the late <abvr> corney in full
possession of the field </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten </s>
<s>   he had a
decided propensity for bullying </s>
<s>   derived no inconsiderable pleasure
from the exercise of petty cruelty </s>
<s>  and consequently was it is
needless to say a coward </s>
<s>   this is by no means a disparagement to his
character </s>
<s>  for many official personages who are held in high respect
and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities </s>
<s>   the remark is
made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of
impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for
office </s>
<s> 

but the measure of his degradation was not yet full </s>
<s>   after making a
tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poorlaws
really were too hard on people </s>
<s>  and that men who ran away from their
wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be
visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious
individuals who had suffered much </s>
<s>  <abvr> bumble came to a room where some
of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish
linen </s>
<s>   when the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble summoning up all his native dignity </s>
<s>  these
women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative </s>
<s>  hallo </s>
<s>  hallo
there </s>
<s>   what do you mean by this noise you hussies </s>
<s> 

with these words <abvr> bumble opened the door and walked in with a very
fierce and angry manner </s>
<s>   which was at once exchanged for a most
humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the
form of his lady wife </s>
<s> 

my dear said <abvr> bumble i didnt know you were here </s>
<s> 

didnt know i was here </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   what do you do
here </s>
<s> 

i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
properly my dear replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   glancing distractedly at a
couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of
admiration at the workhousemasters humility </s>
<s> 

you thought they were talking too much </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  what
business is it of yours </s>
<s> 

why my dear urged <abvr> bumble submissively </s>
<s> 

what business is it of yours </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> bumble again </s>
<s> 

its very true youre matron here my dear submitted <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 
but i thought you mightnt be in the way just then </s>
<s> 

ill tell you what <abvr> bumble returned his lady </s>
<s>   we dont want
any of your interference </s>
<s>   youre a great deal too fond of poking your
nose into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house
laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a
fool every hour in the day </s>
<s>   be off </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two
old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated
for an instant </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble whose patience brooked no delay caught
up a bowl of soapsuds and motioning him towards the door ordered him
instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly
person </s>
<s> 

what could <abvr> bumble do </s>
<s>   he looked dejectedly round and slunk away </s>
<s> 
and as he reached the door the titterings of the paupers broke into a
shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight </s>
<s>   it wanted but this </s>
<s>   he was
degraded in their eyes </s>
<s>  he had lost caste and station before the very
paupers </s>
<s>  he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to
the lowest depth of the most snubbed henpeckery </s>
<s> 

all in two months </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble filled with dismal thoughts </s>
<s> 
two months </s>
<s>   no more than two months ago i was not only my own
master but everybody elses so far as the porochial workhouse was
concerned and now </s>
<s> 

it was too much </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie </s>
<s>  and
walked distractedly into the street </s>
<s> 

he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated
the first passion of his grief </s>
<s>  and then the revulsion of feeling made
him thirsty </s>
<s>   he passed a great many publichouses </s>
<s>  but at length
paused before one in a byway whose parlour as he gathered from a
hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary
customer </s>
<s>   it began to rain heavily at the moment </s>
<s>   this determined
him </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble stepped in </s>
<s>  and ordering something to drink as he
passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the
street </s>
<s> 

the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large
cloak </s>
<s>   he had the air of a stranger </s>
<s>  and seemed by a certain
haggardness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to
have travelled some distance </s>
<s>   he eyed bumble askance as he entered
but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his
salutation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble had quite dignity enough for two </s>
<s>  supposing even that the
stranger had been more familiar </s>
<s>   so he drank his ginandwater in
silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance </s>
<s> 

it so happened however </s>
<s>  as it will happen very often when men fall
into company under such circumstances </s>
<s>   that <abvr> bumble felt every now
and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a
look at the stranger </s>
<s>   and that whenever he did so he withdrew his
eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment
stealing a look at him </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the
very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and
bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike
anything he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold </s>
<s> 

when they had encountered each others glance several times in this
way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence </s>
<s> 

were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window </s>
<s> 

not that i am aware of unless youre <abvr>  here <abvr> bumble stopped
short </s>
<s>  for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in
his impatience he might supply the blank </s>
<s> 

i see you were not said the stranger </s>
<s>  an expression of quiet sarcasm
playing about his mouth </s>
<s>  or you have known my name </s>
<s>   you dont know
it </s>
<s>   i would recommend you not to ask for it </s>
<s> 

i meant no harm young man observed <abvr> bumble majestically </s>
<s> 

and have done none said the stranger </s>
<s> 

another silence succeeded this short dialogue </s>
<s>   which was again broken
by the stranger </s>
<s> 

i have seen you before i think </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>   you were differently
dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should
know you again </s>
<s>   you were beadle here once </s>
<s>  were you not </s>
<s> 

i was said <abvr> bumble in some surprise </s>
<s>  porochial beadle </s>
<s> 

just so rejoined the other nodding his head </s>
<s>   it was in that
character i saw you </s>
<s>   what are you now </s>
<s> 

master of the workhouse rejoined <abvr> bumble slowly and
impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might
otherwise assume </s>
<s>   master of the workhouse young man </s>
<s> 

you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i
doubt not </s>
<s>  resumed the stranger looking keenly into <abvr> bumbles
eyes as he raised them in astonishment at the question </s>
<s> 

dont scruple to answer freely man </s>
<s>   i know you pretty well you see </s>
<s> 

i suppose a married man replied <abvr> bumble shading his eyes with
his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident
perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can
than a single one </s>
<s>   porochial officers are not so well paid that they
can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a
civil and proper manner </s>
<s> 

the stranger smiled and nodded his head again </s>
<s>  as much to say he had
not mistaken his man </s>
<s>  then rang the bell </s>
<s> 

fill this glass again he said handing <abvr> bumbles empty tumbler to
the landlord </s>
<s>   let it be strong and hot </s>
<s>   you like it so i suppose </s>
<s> 

not too strong replied <abvr> bumble with a delicate cough </s>
<s> 

you understand what that means landlord </s>
<s>  said the stranger drily </s>
<s> 

the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a
steaming jorum </s>
<s>  of which the first gulp brought the water into <abvr>
bumbles eyes </s>
<s> 

now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and
window </s>
<s>   i came down to this place today to find you out </s>
<s>  and by
one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends
sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you
were uppermost in my mind </s>
<s>   i want some information from you </s>
<s>   i dont
ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is </s>
<s>   put up that to begin
with </s>
<s> 

as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
companion carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money
should be heard without </s>
<s>   when <abvr> bumble had scrupulously examined the
coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much
satisfaction in his waistcoatpocket he went on </s>
<s> 

carry your memory backlet me seetwelve years last winter </s>
<s>

<s>  cried the stranger </s>
<s>  i speak of one </s>
<s>  a
meeklooking palefaced boy who was apprenticed down here to a
coffinmakeri wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in
itand who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed </s>
<s> 

why you mean oliver </s>
<s>   young twist </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  i remember him
of course </s>
<s>   there wasnt a obstinater young rascal

its not of him i want to hear </s>
<s>  ive heard enough of him said the
stranger stopping <abvr> bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject
of poor olivers vices </s>
<s>   its of a woman </s>
<s>  the hag that nursed his
mother </s>
<s>   where is she </s>
<s> 

where is she </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bumble whom the ginandwater had rendered
facetious </s>
<s>   it would be hard to tell </s>
<s>   theres no midwifery there
whichever place shes gone to </s>
<s>  so i suppose shes out of employment
anyway </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  demanded the stranger sternly </s>
<s> 

that she died last winter rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and
although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards his
gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in
thought </s>
<s>   for some time he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be
relieved or disappointed by the intelligence </s>
<s>  but at length he breathed
more freely </s>
<s>  and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great
matter </s>
<s>  with that he rose as if to depart </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> bumble was cunning enough </s>
<s>  and he at once saw that an
opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in
the possession of his better half </s>
<s>   he well remembered the night of old
sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good
reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to <abvr>
corney </s>
<s>  and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure
of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know
that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans
attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist </s>
<s> 
hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger
with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old
harridan shortly before she died </s>
<s>  and that she could as he had reason
to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry </s>
<s> 

how can i find her </s>
<s>  said the stranger thrown off his guard </s>
<s>  and
plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused
afresh by the intelligence </s>
<s> 

only through me rejoined <abvr> bumble </s>
<s> 

when </s>
<s>  cried the stranger hastily </s>
<s> 

tomorrow rejoined bumble </s>
<s> 

at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of
paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the waterside
in characters that betrayed his agitation </s>
<s>  at nine in the evening
bring her to me there </s>
<s>   i neednt tell you to be secret </s>
<s>   its your
interest </s>
<s> 

with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for
the liquor that had been drunk </s>
<s>   shortly remarking that their roads
were different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic
repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night </s>
<s> 

on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it
contained no name </s>
<s>   the stranger had not gone far so he made after him
to ask it </s>
<s> 

what do you want </s>
<s>  cried the man turning quickly round as bumble
touched him on the arm </s>

only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of

they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might
perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
rain and sheltering them from observation </s>
<s>   the husband carried a
lantern from which however no light yet shone </s>
<s>  and trudged on a few
paces in front as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the
benefit of treading in his heavy footprints </s>
<s>   they went on in profound
silence </s>
<s>  every now and then <abvr> bumble relaxed his pace and turned
his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following </s>
<s>  then
discovering that she was close at his heels he mended his rate of
walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards
their place of destination </s>
<s> 

this was far from being a place of doubtful character </s>
<s>  for it had long
been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under
various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on
plunder and crime </s>
<s>   it was a collection of mere hovels </s>
<s>   some hastily
built with loose bricks </s>
<s>  others of old wormeaten shiptimber </s>
<s>  jumbled
together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for
the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank </s>
<s>   a few leaky
boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which
skirted it </s>
<s>   and here and there an oar or coil of rope </s>
<s>   appeared at
first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages
pursued some avocation on the river </s>
<s>  but a glance at the shattered and
useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a
passerby without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were
disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with
any view to their being actually employed </s>
<s> 

in the heart of this cluster of huts </s>
<s>  and skirting the river which its
upper stories overhung </s>
<s>  stood a large building formerly used as a
manufactory of some kind </s>
<s>   it had in its day probably furnished
employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements </s>
<s>   but it had
long since gone to ruin </s>
<s>   the rat the worm and the action of the
damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood </s>
<s>  and a
considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the
water </s>
<s>  while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream
seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion
and involving itself in the same fate </s>
<s> 

it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as
the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain
commenced pouring violently down </s>
<s> 

the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap
of paper he held in his hand </s>
<s> 

halloa there </s>
<s>  cried a voice from above </s>
<s> 

following the sound <abvr> bumble raised his head and descried a man
looking out of a door breasthigh on the second story </s>
<s> 

stand still a minute cried the voice </s>
<s>  ill be with you directly </s>
<s> 
with which the head disappeared and the door closed </s>
<s> 

is that the man </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> bumbles good lady </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble nodded in the affirmative </s>
<s> 

then mind what i told you said the matron </s>
<s>  and be careful to say
as little as you can or youll betray us at once </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was
apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was
prevented by the appearance of monks </s>
<s>  who opened a small door near
which they stood and beckoned them inwards </s>
<s> 

come in </s>
<s>  he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground </s>
<s> 
dont keep me here </s>
<s> 

the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any
other invitation </s>
<s>   <abvr> bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind
followed </s>
<s>   obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that
remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic </s>
<s> 

what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet </s>
<s>  said
monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the
door behind them </s>
<s> 

wewe were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking
apprehensively about him </s>
<s> 

cooling yourselves </s>
<s>  retorted monks </s>
<s>   not all the rain that ever
fell or ever will fall will put as much of hells fire out as a man
can carry about with him </s>
<s>   you wont cool yourself so easily </s>
<s>  dont
think it </s>
<s> 

with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and
bent his gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was
fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground </s>
<s> 

this is the woman is it </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

hem </s>
<s>   that is the woman replied <abvr> bumble mindful of his wifes
caution </s>
<s> 

you think women never can keep secrets i suppose </s>
<s>  said the matron
interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks </s>
<s> 

i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks </s>
<s> 

and what may that be </s>
<s>  asked the matron </s>
<s> 

the loss of their own good name replied monks </s>
<s>   so by the same
rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her im not afraid of her telling it to anybody </s>
<s>  not i </s>
<s>   do you
understand mistress </s>
<s> 

no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke </s>
<s> 

of course you dont </s>
<s>  said monks </s>
<s>   how should you </s>
<s> 

bestowing something halfway between a smile and a frown upon his two
companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened
across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the
roof </s>
<s>   he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder
leading to another floor of warehouses above </s>
<s>   when a bright flash of
lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed
which shook the crazy building to its centre </s>
<s> 

hear it </s>
<s>  he cried shrinking back </s>
<s>   hear it </s>
<s>   rolling and crashing
on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were
hiding from it </s>
<s>   i hate the sound </s>
<s> 

he remained silent for a few moments </s>
<s>  and then removing his hands
suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable discomposure of <abvr>
bumble that it was much distorted and discoloured </s>
<s> 

these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his
alarm </s>
<s>  and thunder sometimes brings them on </s>
<s>  dont mind me now </s>
<s>  its
all over for this once </s>
<s> 

thus speaking he led the way up the ladder </s>
<s>  and hastily closing the
windowshutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which
hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy
beams in the ceiling </s>
<s>   and which cast a dim light upon an old table and
three chairs that were placed beneath it </s>
<s> 

now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the
sooner we come to our business the better for all </s>
<s>   the woman know
what it is does she </s>
<s> 

the question was addressed to bumble </s>
<s>  but his wife anticipated the
reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it </s>
<s> 

he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died </s>
<s> 
and that she told you something

about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron
interrupting him </s>
<s>   yes </s>
<s> 

the first question is of what nature was her communication </s>
<s>  said
monks </s>
<s> 

thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation </s>
<s>  the
first is what may the communication be worth </s>
<s> 

who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is </s>
<s> 
asked monks </s>
<s> 

nobody better than you i am persuaded answered <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>  who did
not want for spirit as her yokefellow could abundantly testify </s>
<s> 

humph </s>
<s>  said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry </s>
<s> 
there may be moneys worth to get eh </s>
<s> 

perhaps there may was the composed reply </s>
<s> 

something that was taken from her said monks </s>
<s>   something that she
wore </s>
<s>   something that

you had better bid interrupted <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   i have heard enough
already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any
greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened
to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes </s>
<s>   which he
directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised
astonishment </s>
<s>  increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded
what sum was required for the disclosure </s>
<s> 

whats it worth to you </s>
<s>  asked the woman as collectedly as before </s>
<s> 

it may be nothing </s>
<s>  it may be twenty pounds replied monks </s>
<s>  speak
out and let me know which </s>
<s> 

add five pounds to the sum you have named </s>
<s>  give me fiveandtwenty
pounds in gold said the woman </s>
<s>  and ill tell you all i know </s>
<s>   not
before </s>
<s> 

fiveandtwenty pounds </s>
<s>  exclaimed monks drawing back </s>
<s> 

i spoke as plainly as i could replied <abvr> bumble </s>
<s>   its not a
large sum either </s>
<s> 

not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when its
told </s>
<s>  cried monks impatiently </s>
<s>  and which has been lying dead for
twelve years past or more </s>
<s> 

such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value
in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute
indifference she had assumed </s>
<s>   as to lying dead there are those who
will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for
anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last </s>
<s> 

what if i pay it for nothing </s>
<s>  asked monks hesitating </s>
<s> 

you can easily take it away again replied the matron </s>
<s>  i am but a
woman </s>
<s>  alone here </s>
<s>  and unprotected </s>
<s> 

not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted <abvr> bumble
in a voice tremulous with fear </s>
<s>  i am here my dear </s>
<s>  and besides
said <abvr> bumble his teeth chattering as he spoke <abvr> monks is too
much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons </s>
<s>   <abvr>
monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a
little run to seed as i may say </s>
<s>  bu he has heerd </s>
<s>   i say i have no
doubt <abvr> monks has heerd my dear </s>
<s>   that i am a very determined
officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused </s>
<s>   i only want
a little rousing </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern
with fierce determination </s>
<s>  and plainly showed by the alarmed
expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and
not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration </s>
<s>  unless
indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for
the purpose </s>
<s> 

you are a fool said <abvr> bumble in reply </s>
<s>  and had better hold your
tongue </s>
<s> 

he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a
lower tone said monks grimly </s>
<s>   so </s>
<s>   hes your husband eh </s>
<s> 

he my husband </s>
<s>  tittered the matron parrying the question </s>
<s> 

i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the
angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke </s>
<s>   so
much the better </s>
<s>  i have less hesitation in dealing with two people
when i find that theres only one will between them </s>
<s>   im in earnest </s>
<s> 
see here </s>
<s> 

he thrust his hand into a sidepocket </s>
<s>  and producing a canvas bag told
out twentyfive sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the
woman </s>
<s> 

now he said gather them up </s>
<s>  and when this cursed peal of thunder
which i feel is coming up to break over the housetop is gone lets
hear your story </s>
<s> 

the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break
almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from
the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say </s>
<s>   the
faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the small
table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to
render her whisper audible </s>
<s>   the sickly rays of the suspended lantern
falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of
their countenances </s>
<s>  which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness
looked ghastly in the extreme </s>
<s> 

when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began
she and i were alone </s>
<s> 

was there no one by </s>
<s>  asked monks in the same hollow whisper </s>
<s>  no
sick wretch or idiot in some other bed </s>
<s>   no one who could hear and
might by possibility understand </s>
<s> 

not a soul replied the woman </s>
<s>  we were alone </s>
<s>   i stood alone
beside the body when death came over it </s>
<s> 

good said monks regarding her attentively </s>
<s>   go on </s>
<s> 

she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a
child into the world some years before </s>
<s>  not merely in the same room
but in the same bed in which she then lay dying </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder
blood </s>
<s>   how things come about </s>
<s> 

the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron
nodding carelessly towards her husband </s>
<s>  the mother this nurse had
robbed </s>
<s> 

in life </s>
<s>  asked monks </s>
<s> 

in death replied the woman with something like a shudder </s>
<s>  she
stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the
dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the
infants sake </s>
<s> 

she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness </s>
<s>  did she sell it </s>
<s> 
where </s>
<s>   when </s>
<s>   to whom </s>
<s>   how long before </s>
<s> 

as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said
the matron she fell back and died </s>
<s> 

without saying more </s>
<s>  cried monks in a voice which from its very
suppression seemed only the more furious </s>
<s>   its a lie </s>
<s>  ill not be
played with </s>
<s>   she said more </s>
<s>   ill tear the life out of you both but
ill know what it was </s>
<s> 

she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance
unmoved as <abvr> bumble was very far from being by the strange mans
violence </s>
<s>  but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which
was partly closed </s>
<s>  and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the
hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper </s>
<s> 

which contained interposed monks stretching forward </s>
<s> 

nothing replied the woman </s>
<s>  it was a pawnbrokers duplicate </s>
<s> 

for what </s>
<s>  demanded monks </s>
<s> 

in good time ill tell you </s>
<s>  said the woman </s>
<s>   i judge that she had
kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better
account </s>
<s>  and then had pawned it </s>
<s>  and had saved or scraped together
money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its
running out </s>
<s>  so that if anything came of it it could still be
redeemed </s>
<s>   nothing had come of it </s>
<s>  and as i tell you she died with
the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand </s>
<s>   the time was
out in two days </s>
<s>  i thought something might one day come of it too </s>
<s>  and
so redeemed the pledge </s>
<s> 

where is it now </s>
<s>  asked monks quickly </s>
<s> 

there replied the woman </s>
<s>   and as if glad to be relieved of it
she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough
for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling
hands </s>
<s>   it contained a little gold locket </s>
<s>  in which were two locks of
hair and a plain gold weddingring </s>
<s> 

it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman </s>
<s> 

there is a blank left for the surname </s>
<s>  and then follows the date </s>
<s> 
which is within a year before the child was born </s>
<s>   i found out that </s>
<s> 

and this is all </s>
<s>  said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the
contents of the little packet </s>
<s> 

all replied the woman </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bumble drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the
story was over and no mention made of taking the fiveandtwenty
pounds back again </s>
<s>  and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration
which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of
the previous dialogue </s>
<s> 

i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his
wife addressing monks after a short silence </s>
<s>  and i want to know
nothing </s>
<s>  for its safer not </s>
<s>   but i may ask you two questions may i </s>
<s> 

you may ask said monks with some show of surprise </s>
<s>  but whether i
answer or not is another question </s>
<s> 

which makes three observed <abvr> bumble essaying a stroke of
facetiousness </s>
<s> 

is that what you expected to get from me </s>
<s>  demanded the matron </s>
<s> 

it is replied monks </s>
<s>   the other question </s>
<s> 

what do you propose to do with it </s>
<s>   can it be used against me </s>
<s> 

never rejoined monks </s>
<s>  nor against me either </s>
<s>   see here </s>
<s>   but dont
move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush </s>
<s> 

with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an
iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened
close at <abvr> bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several
paces backward with great precipitation </s>
<s> 

look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf </s>
<s>  dont
fear me </s>
<s>   i could have let you down quietly enough when you were
seated over it if that had been my game </s>
<s> 

thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink </s>
<s>  and even <abvr> bumble
himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same </s>
<s>  the turbid
water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below </s>
<s>  and all
other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against
the green and slimy piles </s>
<s>   there had once been a watermill beneath </s>
<s> 
the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments
of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new
impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted
to stem its headlong course </s>
<s> 

if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow
morning </s>
<s>  said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well </s>
<s> 

twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied
bumble recoiling at the thought </s>
<s> 

monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly
thrust it </s>
<s>  and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed a part of
some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream </s>
<s> 
it fell straight and true as a die </s>
<s>  clove the water with a scarcely
audible splash </s>
<s>  and was gone </s>
<s> 

the three looking into each others faces seemed to breathe more
freely </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back
into its former position </s>
<s>   if the sea ever gives up its dead as books
say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash
among it </s>
<s>   we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant
party </s>
<s> 

by all means observed <abvr> bumble with great alacrity </s>
<s> 

youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you </s>
<s>  said monks with a
threatening look </s>
<s>   i am not afraid of your wife </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon me young man answered <abvr> bumble bowing
himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness </s>
<s>  on
everybodys account young man </s>
<s>  on my own you know <abvr> monks </s>
<s> 

i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks </s>
<s>  light your
lantern </s>
<s>   and get away from here as fast as you can </s>
<s> 

it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or <abvr>
bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would
infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below </s>
<s>   he lighted his
lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now
carried in his hand </s>
<s>  and making no effort to prolong the discourse
descended in silence followed by his wife </s>
<s>   monks brought up the rear
after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other
sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the
rushing of the water </s>
<s> 

they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution </s>
<s>  for monks
started at every shadow </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bumble holding his lantern a foot
above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a
marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure </s>
<s>   looking
nervously about him for hidden trapdoors </s>
<s>   the gate at which they had
entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks </s>
<s>  merely exchanging a
nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into
the wet and darkness outside </s>
<s> 

they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an
invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been
hidden somewhere below </s>
<s>  bidding him go first and bear the light he
returned to the chamber he had just quitted </s>
<s> 



chapter xxxix

introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already
acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads
together

on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned
in the last </s>
<s> disposed of their little matter of business as
therein narrated <abvr> william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily
growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was </s>
<s> 

the room in which <abvr> sikes propounded this question was not one of
those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it
was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great
distance from his former lodgings </s>
<s>   it was not in appearance so
desirable a habitation as his old quarters </s>
<s>   being a mean and
badlyfurnished apartment of very limited size </s>
<s>  lighted only by one
small window in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty
lane </s>
<s>   nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans
having gone down in the world of late </s>
<s>   for a great scarcity of
furniture and total absence of comfort together with the
disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen
bespoke a state of extreme poverty </s>
<s>  while the meagre and attenuated
condition of <abvr> sikes himself would have fully confirmed these
symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration </s>
<s> 

the housebreaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat
by way of dressinggown and displaying a set of features in no degree
improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled
nightcap and a stiff black beard of a weeks growth </s>
<s>   the dog sat at
the bedside </s>
<s>   now eyeing his master with a wistful look and now
pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the
street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention </s>
<s> 
seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which
formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female </s>
<s>   so pale
and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been
considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has
already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to
mr </s>
<s>  sikess question </s>
<s> 

not long gone seven said the girl </s>
<s>   how do you feel tonight bill </s>
<s> 

as weak as water replied <abvr> sikes with an imprecation on his eyes
and limbs </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>  lend us a hand and let me get off this thundering
bed anyhow </s>
<s> 

illness had not improved <abvr> sikess temper </s>
<s>  for as the girl raised
him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her
awkwardness and struck her </s>
<s> 

whining are you </s>
<s>  said sikes </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   dont stand snivelling there </s>
<s> 
if you cant do anything better than that cut off altogether </s>
<s>   dye
hear me </s>
<s> 

i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a
laugh </s>
<s>   what fancy have you got in your head now </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  youve thought better of it have you </s>
<s>  growled sikes marking the
tear which trembled in her eye </s>
<s>   all the better for you you have </s>
<s> 

why you dont mean to say youd be hard upon me tonight bill
said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   why not </s>
<s> 

such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans
tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even
to her voice </s>
<s>  such a number of nights as ive been patient with you
nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child </s>
<s>  and this the
first that ive seen you like yourself </s>
<s>  you wouldnt have served me as
you did just now if youd thought of that would you </s>
<s>   come come </s>
<s>  say
you wouldnt </s>
<s> 

well then rejoined <abvr> sikes i wouldnt </s>
<s>   why damme now the
girlss whining again </s>
<s> 

its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair </s>
<s>  dont
you seem to mind me </s>
<s>   itll soon be over </s>
<s> 

whatll be over </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> sikes in a savage voice </s>
<s>  what foolery
are you up to now again </s>
<s>   get up and bustle about and dont come
over me with your womans nonsense </s>
<s> 

at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was
delivered would have had the desired effect </s>
<s>  but the girl being really
weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and
fainted before <abvr> sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his
threats </s>
<s>   not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon
emergency </s>
<s>  for miss nancys hysterics were usually of that violent kind
which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  sikes tried a little blasphemy </s>
<s>  and finding that mode of treatment
wholly ineffectual called for assistance </s>
<s> 

whats the matter here my dear </s>
<s>  said fagin looking in </s>
<s> 

lend a hand to the girl cant you </s>
<s>  replied sikes impatiently </s>
<s>  dont
stand chattering and grinning at me </s>
<s> 

with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls
assistance while <abvr> john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who
had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on
the floor a bundle with which he was laden </s>
<s>  and snatching a bottle from
the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels uncorked
it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents
down the patients throat </s>
<s>   previously taking a taste himself to
prevent mistakes </s>
<s> 

give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said <abvr>
dawkins </s>
<s>  and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the
petticuts </s>
<s> 

these united restoratives administered with great energy </s>
<s>  especially
that department consigned to master bates who appeared to consider his
share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry </s>
<s>   were not
long in producing the desired effect </s>
<s>   the girl gradually recovered her
senses </s>
<s>  and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon
the pillow </s>
<s>   leaving <abvr> sikes to confront the new comers in some
astonishment at their unlookedfor appearance </s>
<s> 

why what evil wind has blowed you here </s>
<s>  he asked fagin </s>
<s> 

no evil wind at all my dear for evil winds blow nobody any good </s>
<s>  and
ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see </s>
<s> 
dodger my dear open the bundle </s>
<s>  and give bill the little trifles that

which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth </s>

the articles it contained one by one to charley bates </s>

them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and
excellence </s>

sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing
to view a huge pasty </s>
<s>  sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender
limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no

<s> 

uttering this last panegyric master bates produced from one of his
extensive pockets a fullsized winebottle carefully corked </s>
<s>  while
mr </s>
<s>  dawkins at the same instant poured out a wineglassful of raw
spirits from the bottle he carried </s>
<s>   which the invalid tossed down his
throat without a moments hesitation </s>

ah </s>

<s>  youll

<s>

<s>  exclaimed <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  i might have been done for twenty times
over afore youd have done anything to help me </s>

leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you falsehearted
wagabond </s>
<s>

<s>  said fagin shrugging his shoulders </s>
<s>  and us
come to bring him all these beautiful things </s>
<s> 

the things is well enough in their way observed <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>   a little
soothed as he glanced over the table </s>

yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health
blunt and everything else </s>
<s>  and take no more notice of me all this
mortal time than if i was that ere dog </s>

i never see such a jolly dog as that cried master bates doing as he

hed make his fortun on the stage that dog would and rewive the
drayma besides </s>

hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed </s>
<s>  still
growling angrily </s>

old fence eh </s>
<s> 

i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied
the jew </s>
<s> 

and what about the other fortnight </s>
<s>  demanded sikes </s>
<s>   what about the
other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his
hole </s>
<s> 

i couldnt help it bill </s>
<s>   i cant go into a long explanation before
company </s>
<s>  but i couldnt help it upon my honour </s>

upon your what </s>

<s>  here </s>
<s>  cut me
off a piece of that pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out
of my mouth or itll choke me dead </s>
<s> 

dont be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively </s>
<s>  i have
never forgot you bill </s>
<s>  never once </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin </s>
<s> 
youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that i have laid
shivering and burning here </s>
<s>  and bill was to do this </s>
<s>  and bill was to do
that </s>
<s>  and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well </s>
<s> 
and was quite poor enough for your work </s>
<s>  if it hadnt been for the
girl i might have died </s>
<s> 

there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word </s>
<s> 
if it hadnt been for the girl </s>
<s>   who but poor ould fagin was the means
of your having such a handy girl about you </s>
<s> 

he says true enough there </s>
<s>  said nancy coming hastily forward </s>
<s>  let
him be </s>
<s>  let him be </s>
<s> 

nancys appearance gave a new turn to the conversation </s>
<s>  for the boys
receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with
liquor </s>
<s>  of which however she took very sparingly </s>
<s>  while fagin
assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought <abvr> sikes into a
better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant
banter </s>
<s>  and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough
jokes which after repeated applications to the spiritbottle he
condescended to make </s>
<s> 

its all very well said <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  but i must have some blunt from
you tonight </s>
<s> 

i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew </s>
<s> 

then youve got lots at home retorted sikes </s>
<s>  and i must have some
from there </s>
<s> 

lots </s>
<s>  cried fagin holding up is hands </s>
<s>   i havent so much as
would

i dont know how much youve got and i dare say you hardly know
yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes </s>
<s> 
but i must have some tonight </s>
<s>  and thats flat </s>
<s> 

well well said fagin with a sigh ill send the artful round
presently </s>
<s> 

you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined <abvr> sikes </s>
<s>  the artfuls a
deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get
dodged by traps and so be perwented or anything for an excuse if you
put him up to it </s>
<s>   nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all
sure </s>
<s>  and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone </s>
<s> 

after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence </s>
<s>  protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with </s>
<s>  <abvr> sikes sullenly
remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must accompany him home </s>
<s> 
with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard </s>
<s>   the
jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homeward
attended by nancy and the boys </s>
<s>   <abvr> sikes meanwhile flinging himself
on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the
young ladys return </s>
<s> 

in due course they arrived at fagins abode where they found toby
crackit and <abvr> chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage
which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and
with it his fifteenth and last sixpence </s>
<s>  much to the amusement of his
young friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found
relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and
mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat
to go </s>
<s> 

has nobody been toby </s>
<s>  asked fagin </s>
<s> 

not a living leg answered <abvr> crackit pulling up his collar </s>
<s>  its
been as dull as swipes </s>
<s>   you ought to stand something handsome fagin
to recompense me for keeping house so long </s>
<s>  damme im as flat as a
juryman </s>
<s>  and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt
had the good natur to amuse this youngster </s>
<s>   horrid dull im blessed
if i ant </s>
<s> 

with these and other ejaculations of the same kind <abvr> toby crackit
swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with
a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly
beneath the consideration of a man of his figure </s>
<s>  this done he
swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that
mr </s>
<s>  chitling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots
till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his
acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he
didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger </s>
<s> 

wot a rum chap you are tom </s>
<s>  said master bates highly amused by this
declaration </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it replied <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>   am i fagin </s>
<s> 

a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the
shoulder and winking to his other pupils </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> crackit is a heavy swell </s>
<s>  ant he fagin </s>
<s>  asked tom </s>
<s> 

no doubt at all of that my dear </s>
<s> 

and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance </s>
<s>  ant it
fagin </s>
<s>  pursued tom </s>
<s> 

very much so indeed my dear </s>
<s>   theyre only jealous tom because he
wont give it to them </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  cried tom triumphantly thats where it is </s>
<s>   he has cleaned me
out </s>
<s>   but i can go and earn some more when i like </s>
<s>  cant i fagin </s>
<s> 

to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom </s>
<s>  so make up
your loss at once and dont lose any more time </s>
<s>   dodger </s>
<s>  charley </s>
<s> 
its time you were on the lay </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   its near ten and nothing done
yet </s>
<s> 

in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their
hats and left the room </s>
<s>  the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging
as they went in many witticisms at the expense of <abvr> chitling </s>
<s>  in
whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very
conspicuous or peculiar </s>
<s>   inasmuch as there are a great number of
spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than <abvr>
chitling for being seen in good society </s>
<s>   and a great number of fine
gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their
reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit </s>
<s> 

now said fagin when they had left the room ill go and get you
that cash nancy </s>
<s>   this is only the key of a little cupboard where i
keep a few odd things the boys get my dear </s>
<s>   i never lock up my money
for ive got none to lock up my dearha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> none to lock up </s>
<s> 
its a poor trade nancy and no thanks </s>
<s>  but im fond of seeing the
young people about me </s>
<s>  and i bear it all i bear it all </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s>  he
said hastily concealing the key in his breast </s>
<s>  whos that </s>
<s>   listen </s>
<s> 

the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared
in no way interested in the arrival </s>
<s>  or to care whether the person
whoever he was came or went </s>
<s>   until the murmur of a mans voice
reached her ears </s>
<s>   the instant she caught the sound she tore off her
bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under
the table </s>
<s>  the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered
a complaint of the heat </s>
<s>   in a tone of languor that contrasted very
remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action </s>
<s>   which
however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at
the time </s>
<s> 

bah </s>
<s>  he whispered as though nettled by the interruption </s>
<s>  its the
man i expected before </s>
<s>  hes coming downstairs </s>
<s>   not a word about the
money while hes here nance </s>
<s>   he wont stop long </s>
<s>   not ten minutes my
dear </s>
<s> 

laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to
the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without </s>
<s>   he
reached it at the same moment as the visitor who coming hastily into
the room was close upon the girl before he observed her </s>
<s> 

it was monks </s>
<s> 

only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew
back on beholding a stranger </s>
<s>   dont move nancy </s>
<s> 

the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of
careless levity withdrew her eyes </s>
<s>  but as he turned towards fagin she
stole another look </s>
<s>  so keen and searching and full of purpose that if
there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly
have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person </s>
<s> 

any news </s>
<s>  inquired fagin </s>
<s> 

great </s>
<s> 

andandgood </s>
<s>  asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex
the other man by being too sanguine </s>
<s> 

not bad any way replied monks with a smile </s>
<s>   i have been prompt
enough this time </s>
<s>   let me have a word with you </s>
<s> 

the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room
although she could see that monks was pointing to her </s>
<s>   the jew </s>
<s> 
perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money if he
endeavoured to get rid of her </s>
<s>   pointed upward and took monks out of
the room </s>
<s> 

not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say
as they went upstairs </s>
<s>   fagin laughed </s>
<s>  and making some reply which did
not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his
companion to the second story </s>
<s> 

before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the
house the girl had slipped off her shoes </s>
<s>  and drawing her gown loosely
over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door
listening with breathless interest </s>
<s>   the moment the noise ceased she
glided from the room </s>
<s>  ascended the stairs with incredible softness and
silence </s>
<s>  and was lost in the gloom above </s>
<s> 

the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more </s>
<s>  the girl
glided back with the same unearthly tread </s>
<s>  and immediately afterwards
the two men were heard descending </s>
<s>   monks went at once into the street </s>
<s> 
and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money </s>
<s>   when he returned
the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone </s>
<s> 

why nance </s>
<s>  exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the
candle how pale you are </s>
<s> 

pale </s>
<s>  echoed the girl shading her eyes with her hands as if to look
steadily at him </s>
<s> 

quite horrible </s>
<s>   what have you been doing to yourself </s>
<s> 

nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont
know how long and all replied the girl carelessly </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>   let me get
back </s>
<s>  thats a dear </s>
<s> 

with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her
hand </s>
<s>   they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a
goodnight </s>
<s> 

when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep </s>
<s> 
and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue
her way </s>
<s>   suddenly she arose </s>
<s>  and hurrying on in a direction quite
opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened
her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run </s>
<s>   after
completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath </s>
<s>   and as if
suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do
something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears </s>
<s> 

it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full
hopelessness of her condition </s>
<s>  but she turned back </s>
<s>  and hurrying with
nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction </s>
<s>  partly to recover
lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own
thoughts </s>
<s>   soon reached the dwelling where she had left the
housebreaker </s>
<s> 

if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to <abvr> sikes
he did not observe it </s>
<s>  for merely inquiring if she had brought the
money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of
satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the
slumbers which her arrival had interrupted </s>
<s> 

it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so
much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking </s>
<s>  and withal
had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his
temper </s>
<s>  that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical
upon her behaviour and deportment </s>
<s>   that she had all the abstracted and
nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous
step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would
have been obvious to the lynxeyed fagin who would most probably have
taken the alarm at once </s>
<s>  but <abvr> sikes lacking the niceties of
discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than
those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
towards everybody </s>
<s>  and being furthermore in an unusually amiable
condition as has been already observed </s>
<s>  saw nothing unusual in her
demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had
her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been
very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions </s>
<s> 

as that day closed in the girls excitement increased </s>
<s>  and when night
came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink
himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire
in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water
with his gin to render it less inflammatory </s>
<s>  and had pushed his glass
towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when
these symptoms first struck him </s>
<s> 

why burn my body </s>
<s>  said the man raising himself on his hands as he
stared the girl in the face </s>
<s>   you look like a corpse come to life
again </s>
<s>   whats the matter </s>
<s> 

matter </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   nothing </s>
<s>   what do you look at me so hard
for </s>
<s> 

what foolery is this </s>
<s>  demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and
shaking her roughly </s>
<s>   what is it </s>
<s>   what do you mean </s>
<s>   what are you
thinking of </s>
<s> 

of many things bill replied the girl shivering and as she did so
pressing her hands upon her eyes </s>
<s>   but lord </s>
<s>   what odds in that </s>
<s> 

the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed
to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look
which had preceded them </s>
<s> 

i tell you wot it is said sikes </s>
<s>  if you havent caught the fever
and got it comin on now theres something more than usual in the
wind and something dangerous too </s>
<s>   youre not agoing to </s>
<s>   no
damme </s>
<s>  you wouldnt do that </s>
<s> 

do what </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

there aint said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the
words to himself </s>
<s>  there aint a stauncherhearted gal going or id
have cut her throat three months ago </s>
<s>   shes got the fever coming on </s>
<s> 
thats it </s>
<s> 

fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the
bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic </s>
<s> 
the girl jumped up with great alacrity </s>
<s>  poured it quickly out but
with her back towards him </s>
<s>  and held the vessel to his lips while he
drank off the contents </s>
<s> 

now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own
face </s>
<s>  or ill alter it so that you wont know it agin when you do want
it </s>
<s> 

the girl obeyed </s>
<s>   sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the
pillow </s>
<s>  turning his eyes upon her face </s>
<s>   they closed </s>
<s>  opened again </s>
<s> 
closed once more </s>
<s>  again opened </s>
<s>   he shifted his position restlessly </s>
<s> 
and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as
often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about
him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of
rising into a deep and heavy sleep </s>
<s>   the grasp of his hand relaxed </s>
<s> 
the upraised arm fell languidly by his side </s>
<s>  and he lay like one in a
profound trance </s>
<s> 

the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose
from the bedside </s>
<s>   i may be too late even now </s>
<s> 

she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl </s>
<s>   looking fearfully
round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she
expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikess heavy hand upon
her shoulder </s>
<s>  then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the
robbers lips </s>
<s>  and then opening and closing the roomdoor with
noiseless touch hurried from the house </s>
<s> 

a watchman was crying halfpast nine down a dark passage through which
she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare </s>
<s> 

has it long gone the halfhour </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man </s>
<s>  raising his
lantern to her face </s>
<s> 

and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy </s>
<s> 
brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street </s>
<s> 

many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards
the westend of london </s>
<s>   the clock struck ten increasing her
impatience </s>
<s>   she tore along the narrow pavement </s>
<s>   elbowing the
passengers from side to side </s>
<s>  and darting almost under the horses
heads crossed crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly
watching their opportunity to do the like </s>
<s> 

the woman is mad </s>
<s>  said the people turning to look after her as she
rushed away </s>
<s> 

when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were
comparatively deserted </s>
<s>  and here her headlong progress excited a still
greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past </s>
<s>   some
quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening
at such an unusual rate </s>
<s>  and a few made head upon her and looked back
surprised at her undiminished speed </s>
<s>  but they fell off one by one </s>
<s>  and
when she neared her place of destination she was alone </s>
<s> 

it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park </s>
<s> 
as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided
her to the spot the clock struck eleven </s>
<s>   she had loitered for a few
paces as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance </s>
<s>  but the
sound determined her and she stepped into the hall </s>
<s>   the porters seat
was vacant </s>
<s>   she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced
towards the stairs </s>
<s> 

now young woman </s>
<s>  said a smartlydressed female looking out from a
door behind her who do you want here </s>
<s> 

a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl </s>
<s> 

a lady </s>
<s>  was the reply accompanied with a scornful look </s>
<s>  what lady </s>
<s> 

miss maylie said nancy </s>
<s> 

the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied
only by a look of virtuous disdain </s>
<s>  and summoned a man to answer her </s>
<s> 
to him nancy repeated her request </s>
<s> 

what name am i to say </s>
<s>  asked the waiter </s>
<s> 

its of no use saying any replied nancy </s>
<s> 

nor business </s>
<s>  said the man </s>
<s> 

no nor that neither rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   i must see the lady </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said the man pushing her towards the door </s>
<s>   none of this </s>
<s> 
take yourself off </s>
<s> 

i shall be carried out if i go </s>
<s>  said the girl violently </s>
<s>  and i can
make that a job that two of you wont like to do </s>
<s>   isnt there anybody
here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried
for a poor wretch like me </s>
<s> 

this appeal produced an effect on a goodtemperedfaced mancook who
with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward
to interfere </s>
<s> 

take it up for her joe </s>
<s>  cant you </s>
<s>  said this person </s>
<s> 

whats the good </s>
<s>  replied the man </s>
<s>   you dont suppose the young lady
will see such as her </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

this allusion to nancys doubtful character raised a vast quantity of
chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great
fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex </s>
<s>  and strongly
advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel </s>
<s> 

do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again </s>
<s> 
but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for
god almightys sake </s>
<s> 

the softhearted cook added his intercession and the result was that
the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery </s>
<s> 

whats it to be </s>
<s>  said the man with one foot on the stairs </s>
<s> 

that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone said
nancy </s>
<s>  and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to
say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned
out of doors as an impostor </s>
<s> 

i say said the man youre coming it strong </s>
<s> 

you give the message said the girl firmly </s>
<s>  and let me hear the
answer </s>
<s> 

the man ran upstairs </s>
<s>   nancy remained pale and almost breathless
listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn
of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific </s>
<s>  and of which they
became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman
was to walk upstairs </s>
<s> 

its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid </s>
<s> 

brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the
second </s>
<s> 

the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of </s>
<s> 
and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful </s>
<s>  with which
the dianas concluded </s>
<s> 

regardless of all this </s>
<s>  for she had weightier matters at heart </s>
<s>  nancy
followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber
lighted by a lamp from the ceiling </s>
<s>  here he left her and retired </s>

chapter xl

a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber

the girls life had been squandered in the streets and among the most
noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the
womans original nature left in her still </s>
<s>  and when she heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered
and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
moment contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame
and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with
whom she had sought this interview </s>
<s> 

but struggling with these better feelings was pridethe vice of the
lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and
selfassured </s>
<s>   the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the
fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the
jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itselfeven
this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the
womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected
her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated so
many many traces when a very child </s>
<s> 

she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl </s>
<s>  then bending
them on the ground she tossed her head with affected carelessness as
she said </s>
<s> 

its a hard matter to get to see you lady </s>
<s>   if i had taken offence
and gone away as many would have done youd have been sorry for it
one day and not without reason either </s>
<s> 

i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you replied rose </s>
<s> 
do not think of that </s>
<s>   tell me why you wished to see me </s>
<s>  i am the
person you inquired for </s>
<s> 

the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the
absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl
completely by surprise and she burst into tears </s>
<s> 

oh lady lady </s>
<s>  she said clasping her hands passionately before her
face if there was more like you there would be fewer like methere
wouldthere would </s>
<s> 

sit down said rose earnestly </s>
<s>   if you are in poverty or affliction
i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i cani shall indeed </s>
<s>   sit

yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance
in case she should require it </s>
<s>   why </s>
<s> 

because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of
others in your hands </s>
<s>   i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to
old fagins on the night he went out from the house in pentonville </s>
<s> 

you </s>

<s> 

i lady </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>   i am the infamous creature you have
heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first
moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets
have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so
help me god </s>
<s>   do not mind shrinking openly from me lady </s>
<s>   i am younger
than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it </s>
<s>  the
poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement </s>
<s> 

what dreadful things are these </s>
<s>  said rose involuntarily falling from
her strange companion </s>
<s> 

thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you
had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you
were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness
andandsomething worse than allas i have been from my cradle </s>
<s>   i
may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will
be my deathbed </s>
<s> 

i pity you </s>
<s>  said rose in a broken voice </s>
<s>   it wrings my heart to
hear you </s>
<s> 

heaven bless you for your goodness </s>
<s>  rejoined the girl </s>
<s>  if you knew
what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed </s>
<s>  but i have stolen away
from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to
tell you what i have overheard </s>
<s>   do you know a man named monks </s>
<s> 

no said rose </s>
<s> 

he knows you replied the girl </s>
<s>  and knew you were here for it was
by hearing him tell the place that i found you out </s>
<s> 

i never heard the name said rose </s>
<s> 

then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i
more than thought before </s>
<s>   some time ago and soon after oliver was put
into your house on the night of the robbery isuspecting this
manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark </s>
<s> 
i found out from what i heard that monksthe man i asked you about
you know

yes said rose i understand </s>
<s> 

that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidently with two of
our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be
the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out
why </s>
<s>   a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he
should have a certain sum </s>
<s>  and he was to have more for making him a
thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own </s>
<s> 

for what purpose </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of
finding out said the girl </s>
<s>  and there are not many people besides me
that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery </s>
<s>   but
i did </s>
<s>  and i saw him no more till last night </s>
<s> 

and what occurred then </s>
<s> 

ill tell you lady </s>
<s>   last night he came again </s>
<s>   again they went
upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray
me again listened at the door </s>
<s>   the first words i heard monks say were
these </s>
<s>   so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of
the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is
rotting in her coffin </s>
<s>   they laughed and talked of his success in
doing this </s>
<s>  and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild
said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed
rather have had it the other way </s>
<s>  for what a game it would have been
to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him
through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital
felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit
of him besides </s>
<s> 

what is all this </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s> 

the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl </s>
<s> 
then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to
yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life
without bringing his own neck in danger he would </s>
<s>  but as he couldnt
hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life </s>
<s>  and if he
took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet </s>
<s>  in
short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as
ill contrive for my young brother oliver </s>

his brother </s>
<s>  exclaimed rose </s>
<s> 

those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had
scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes
haunted her perpetually </s>
<s>   and more </s>
<s>  when he spoke of you and the other
lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against
him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said
there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds
of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who
your twolegged spaniel was </s>
<s> 

you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this
was said in earnest </s>
<s> 

he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did replied the
girl shaking her head </s>
<s>   he is an earnest man when his hatred is up </s>
<s> 
i know many who do worse things </s>
<s>  but id rather listen to them all a
dozen times than to that monks once </s>
<s>   it is growing late and i have
to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as
this </s>
<s>   i must get back quickly </s>
<s> 

but what can i do </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s>   to what use can i turn this
communication without you </s>
<s>   back </s>
<s>   why do you wish to return to
companions you paint in such terrible colors </s>
<s>   if you repeat this
information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the
next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an
hours delay </s>
<s> 

i wish to go back said the girl </s>
<s>   i must go back becausehow can
i tell such things to an innocent lady like you </s>
<s> because among the men
i have told you of there is one </s>
<s>  the most desperate among them all </s>
<s> 
that i cant leave </s>
<s>   no not even to be saved from the life i am
leading now </s>
<s> 

your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose </s>
<s> 
your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard </s>
<s> 
your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say </s>
<s>  your
evident contrition and sense of shame </s>
<s>  all lead me to believe that you
might yet be reclaimed </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  said the earnest girl folding her hands
as the tears coursed down her face do not turn a deaf ear to the
entreaties of one of your own sex </s>
<s>  the firstthe first i do believe
who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion </s>
<s>   do hear
my words and let me save you yet for better things </s>
<s> 

lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady
you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and
if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of
sin and sorrow </s>
<s>  but it is too late it is too late </s>

it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement </s>

it is cried the girl writhing in agony of her mind </s>
<s>  i cannot leave
him now </s>
<s>   i could not be his death </s>

why should you be </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

nothing could save him cried the girl </s>
<s>   if i told others what i
have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die </s>
<s> 
he is the boldest and has been so cruel </s>
<s> 

is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can
resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue </s>
<s>   it is
madness </s>
<s> 

i dont know what it is answered the girl </s>
<s>  i only know that it is
so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and
wretched as myself </s>
<s>   i must go back </s>
<s>   whether it is gods wrath for the
wrong i have done i do not know </s>
<s>  but i am drawn back to him through
every suffering and ill usage </s>

that i was to die by his hand at last </s>

what am i to do </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s>   i should not let you depart from me
thus </s>
<s> 

you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising </s>
<s> 
you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness
and forced no promise from you as i might have done </s>
<s> 

of what use then is the communication you have made </s>
<s>  said rose </s>
<s> 
this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me
benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve </s>
<s> 

you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl </s>
<s> 

but where can i find you again when it is necessary </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s>   i
do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will
you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time </s>
<s> 

will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and
come alone or with the only other person that knows it </s>
<s>  and that i
shall not be watched or followed </s>
<s>  asked the girl </s>
<s> 

i promise you solemnly answered rose </s>
<s> 

every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said
the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am
alive </s>
<s> 

stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly
towards the door </s>
<s>   think once again on your own condition and the
opportunity you have of escaping from it </s>
<s>   you have a claim on me </s>
<s>   not
only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost
almost beyond redemption </s>
<s>   will you return to this gang of robbers and
to this man when a word can save you </s>
<s>   what fascination is it that can
take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  is
there no chord in your heart that i can touch </s>
<s>   is there nothing left
to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation </s>

when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the
girl steadily give away your hearts love will carry you all
lengthseven such as you who have home friends other admirers
everything to fill them </s>
<s>   when such as i who have no certain roof but
the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital
nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place
that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to
cure us </s>
<s>   pity us ladypity us for having only one feeling of the
woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a
comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering </s>
<s> 

you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which
may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet
again </s>
<s> 

not a penny replied the girl waving her hand </s>
<s> 

do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said
rose stepping gently forward </s>
<s>   i wish to serve you indeed </s>
<s> 

you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands
if you could take my life at once </s>

of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be
something not to die in the hell in which i have lived </s>

sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought
shame on mine </s>

thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away </s>

while rose maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which
had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank
into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts </s>
<s> 



chapter xli

containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like
misfortunes seldom come alone

her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty </s>
<s>  while
she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the
confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed
had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl </s>
<s>   her words and
manner had touched rose maylies heart </s>
<s>  and mingled with her love for
her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour
was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope </s>
<s> 

they purposed remaining in london only three days prior to departing
for some weeks to a distant part of the coast </s>
<s>   it was now midnight of
the first day </s>
<s>   what course of action could she determine upon which
could be adopted in eightandforty hours </s>
<s>  or how could she postpone
the journey without exciting suspicion </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  losberne was with them and would be for the next two days </s>
<s>  but
rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans
impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first
explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of
olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her
representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no
experienced person </s>
<s>   these were all reasons for the greatest caution
and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to <abvr> maylie
whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the
worthy doctor on the subject </s>
<s>   as to resorting to any legal adviser
even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of
for the same reason </s>
<s>   once the thought occurred to her of seeking
assistance from harry </s>
<s>  but this awakened the recollection of their last
parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back whenthe
tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflectionhe
might have by this time learnt to forget her and to be happier away </s>
<s> 

disturbed by these different reflections </s>
<s>  inclining now to one course
and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive
consideration presented itself to her mind </s>
<s>  rose passed a sleepless and
anxious night </s>
<s>   after more communing with herself next day she arrived
at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry </s>
<s> 

if it be painful to him she thought to come back here how painful
it will be to me </s>
<s>   but perhaps he will not come </s>
<s>  he may write or he
may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when
he went away </s>
<s>   i hardly thought he would </s>
<s>  but it was better for us
both </s>
<s>   and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the
very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep </s>
<s> 

she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and
had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without
writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the
streets with <abvr> giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such
breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new
cause of alarm </s>
<s> 

what makes you look so flurried </s>
<s>  asked rose advancing to meet him </s>
<s> 

i hardly know how </s>
<s>  i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy </s>
<s> 
oh dear </s>
<s>   to think that i should see him at last and you should be
able to know that i have told you the truth </s>
<s> 

i never thought you had told us anything but the truth said rose
soothing him </s>
<s>   but what is this </s>
<s> of whom do you speak </s>
<s> 

i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to
articulate the gentleman who was so good to memr </s>
<s>  brownlow that we
have so often talked about </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s>  asked rose </s>
<s> 

getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight
and going into a house </s>
<s>   i didnt speak to himi couldnt speak to
him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go
up to him </s>
<s>   but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they
said he did </s>
<s>   look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here
it is </s>
<s>  heres where he livesim going there directly </s>
<s>   oh dear me
dear me </s>
<s>   what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak
again </s>
<s> 

with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many
other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was
craven street in the strand </s>
<s>   she very soon determined upon turning
the discovery to account </s>
<s> 

quick </s>
<s>  she said </s>
<s>   tell them to fetch a hackneycoach and be ready
to go with me </s>
<s>   i will take you there directly without a minutes loss
of time </s>
<s>   i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour
and be ready as soon as you are </s>
<s> 

oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five
minutes they were on their way to craven street </s>
<s>   when they arrived
there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the
old gentleman to receive him </s>
<s>  and sending up her card by the servant
requested to see <abvr> brownlow on very pressing business </s>
<s>   the servant
soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs </s>
<s>  and following him
into an upper room miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman
of benevolent appearance in a bottlegreen coat </s>
<s>   at no great distance
from whom was seated another old gentleman in nankeen breeches and
gaiters </s>
<s>  who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting
with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin
propped thereupon </s>
<s> 

dear me said the gentleman in the bottlegreen coat hastily rising
with great politeness i beg your pardon young ladyi imagined it
was some importunate person whoi beg you will excuse me </s>
<s>   be seated
pray </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow i believe sir </s>
<s>  said rose glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken </s>
<s> 

that is my name said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   this is my friend <abvr>
grimwig </s>
<s>   grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes </s>
<s> 

i believe interposed miss maylie that at this period of our
interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away </s>
<s> 
if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i
wish to speak to you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow inclined his head </s>
<s>   <abvr> grimwig who had made one very
stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and
dropped into it again </s>
<s> 

i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally
embarrassed </s>
<s>  but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest
in hearing of him again </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s> 

oliver twist you knew him as replied rose </s>
<s> 

the words no sooner escaped her lips than <abvr> grimwig who had been
affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with
a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his
features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder and indulged
in a prolonged and vacant stare </s>
<s>  then as if ashamed of having betrayed
so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into
his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long
deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air
but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  browlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not
expressed in the same eccentric manner </s>
<s>   he drew his chair nearer to
miss maylies and said

do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which
nobody else knows anything </s>
<s>  and if you have it in your power to produce
any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once
induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in
possession of it </s>
<s> 

a bad one </s>
<s>   ill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled <abvr>
grimwig speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle
of his face </s>
<s> 

he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose
colouring </s>
<s>  and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do
honour to many who have numbered his days six times over </s>
<s> 

im only sixtyone said <abvr> grimwig with the same rigid face </s>
<s>  and
as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i
dont see the application of that remark </s>
<s> 

do not heed my friend miss maylie said <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  he does not
mean what he says </s>
<s> 

yes he does growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

no he does not said <abvr> brownlow obviously rising in wrath as he
spoke </s>
<s> 

hell eat his head if he doesnt growled <abvr> grimwig </s>
<s> 

he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said <abvr>
brownlow </s>
<s> 

and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded <abvr>
grimwig knocking his stick upon the floor </s>
<s> 

having gone thus far the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and
afterwards shook hands according to their invariable custom </s>
<s> 

now miss maylie said <abvr> brownlow to return to the subject in
which your humanity is so much interested </s>
<s>   will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child </s>
<s>   allowing me to promise that
i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since
i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had
imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob
me has been considerably shaken </s>
<s> 

rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a
few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left <abvr>
brownlows house </s>
<s>  reserving nancys information for that gentlemans
private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow
for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former
benefactor and friend </s>
<s> 

thank god </s>
<s>  said the old gentleman </s>
<s>   this is great happiness to me
great happiness </s>
<s>   but you have not told me where he is now miss
maylie </s>
<s>   you must pardon my finding fault with youbut why not have
brought him </s>
<s> 

he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose </s>
<s> 

at this door </s>
<s>  cried the old gentleman </s>
<s>   with which he hurried out of
the room down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach
without another word </s>
<s> 

when the roomdoor closed behind him <abvr> grimwig lifted up his head
and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot
described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and
the table </s>
<s>  sitting in it all the time </s>
<s>   after performing this
evolution he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room
at least a dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed
her without the slightest preface </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
proceeding </s>
<s>   dont be afraid </s>
<s>   im old enough to be your grandfather </s>
<s> 
youre a sweet girl </s>
<s>   i like you </s>
<s>   here they are </s>
<s> 

in fact as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
seat <abvr> brownlow returned accompanied by oliver whom <abvr> grimwig
received very graciously </s>
<s>  and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf
rose maylie would have been well repaid </s>
<s> 

there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said
mr </s>
<s>  brownlow ringing the bell </s>
<s>   send <abvr> bedwin here if you please </s>
<s> 

the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch </s>
<s>  and
dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders </s>
<s> 

why you get blinder every day bedwin said <abvr> brownlow rather
testily </s>
<s> 

well that i do sir replied the old lady </s>
<s>   peoples eyes at my
time of life dont improve with age sir </s>
<s> 

i could have told you that rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  but put on your
glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will
you </s>
<s> 

the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles </s>
<s>  but
olivers patience was not proof against this new trial </s>
<s>  and yielding to
his first impulse he sprang into her arms </s>
<s> 

god be good to me </s>
<s>  cried the old lady embracing him </s>
<s>  it is my
innocent boy </s>
<s> 

my dear old nurse </s>
<s>  cried oliver </s>
<s> 

he would come backi knew he would said the old lady holding him
in her arms </s>
<s>   how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is
dressed again </s>
<s>   where have you been this long long while </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  the
same sweet face but not so pale </s>
<s>  the same soft eye but not so sad </s>
<s>   i
have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every
day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone
since i was a lightsome young creature </s>
<s>   running on thus and now
holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to
her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul
laughed and wept upon his neck by turns </s>
<s> 

leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure <abvr> brownlow led
the way into another room </s>
<s>  and there heard from rose a full narration
of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise
and perplexity </s>
<s>   rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in
her friend <abvr> losberne in the first instance </s>
<s>   the old gentleman
considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold
solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself </s>
<s>   to afford him an
early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged
that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and
that in the meantime <abvr> maylie should be cautiously informed of all
that had occurred </s>
<s>   these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver
returned home </s>
<s> 

rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath </s>
<s> 
nancys history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a
shower of mingled threats and execrations </s>
<s>  threatened to make her the
first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs </s>
<s>  blathers and duff </s>
<s> 
and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the
assistance of those worthies </s>
<s>   and doubtless he would in this first
outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments
consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in
part by corresponding violence on the side of <abvr> brownlow who was
himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and
representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his
hotbrained purpose </s>
<s> 

then what the devil is to be done </s>
<s>  said the impetuous doctor when
they had rejoined the two ladies </s>
<s>   are we to pass a vote of thanks to
all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred
pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some
slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver </s>
<s> 

not exactly that rejoined <abvr> brownlow laughing </s>
<s>  but we must
proceed gently and with great care </s>
<s> 

gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor </s>
<s>   id send them one and
all to

never mind where interposed <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   but reflect whether
sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view </s>
<s> 

what object </s>
<s>  asked the doctor </s>
<s> 

simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the
inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently
deprived </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> losberne cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s> 
i almost forgot that </s>
<s> 

you see pursued <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  placing this poor girl entirely out
of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these
scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should
we bring about </s>
<s> 

hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the
doctor and transporting the rest </s>
<s> 

very good replied <abvr> brownlow smiling </s>
<s>  but no doubt they will
bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step
in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interestor at least to
olivers which is the same thing </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s>  inquired the doctor </s>
<s> 

thus </s>
<s>   it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in
getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man
monks upon his knees </s>
<s>   that can only be done by stratagem and by
catching him when he is not surrounded by these people </s>
<s>   for suppose
he were apprehended we have no proof against him </s>
<s>   he is not even so
far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang
in any of their robberies </s>
<s>  if he were not discharged it is very
unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being
committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond </s>
<s>  and of course ever
afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as
well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot </s>
<s> 

then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether
you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
considered binding </s>
<s>  a promise made with the best and kindest
intentions but really

do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said <abvr>
brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak </s>
<s>  the promise
shall be kept </s>
<s>   i dont think it will in the slightest degree
interfere with our proceedings </s>
<s>   but before we can resolve upon any
precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl </s>
<s>  to
ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the
understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law </s>
<s> 
or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an
account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us
to identify him </s>
<s>   she cannot be seen until next sunday night </s>
<s>  this is
tuesday </s>
<s>   i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly
quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself </s>
<s> 

although <abvr> losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving
a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course
occurred to him just then </s>
<s>  and as both rose and <abvr> maylie sided very
strongly with <abvr> brownlow that gentlemans proposition was carried
unanimously </s>
<s> 

i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grimwig </s>
<s>   he
is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material
assistance to us </s>
<s>  i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted
the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of
course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not
you must determine for yourselves </s>
<s> 

i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in
mine said the doctor </s>
<s> 

we must put it to the vote replied <abvr> brownlow who may he be </s>
<s> 

that ladys son and this young ladysvery old friend said the
doctor motioning towards <abvr> maylie and concluding with an
expressive glance at her niece </s>
<s> 

rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this
motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority </s>
<s>  and harry maylie and
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig were accordingly added to the committee </s>
<s> 

we stay in town of course said <abvr> maylie while there remains
the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
success </s>
<s>   i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the
object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to
remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that
any hope remains </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>   and as i see on the faces about me a
disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to
corroborate olivers tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me
stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may
deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story </s>
<s>   believe
me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite
hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and
disappointments already quite numerous enough </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>   supper has been
announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will
have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company
and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the
world </s>
<s> 

with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to <abvr> maylie and
escorted her into the supperroom </s>
<s>   <abvr> losberne followed leading
rose </s>

chapter xlii

an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius
becomes a public character in the metropolis

upon the night when nancy having lulled <abvr> sikes to sleep hurried on
her selfimposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london
by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that
this history should bestow some attention </s>
<s> 

they were a man and woman </s>
<s>  or perhaps they would be better described as
a male and female </s>
<s>   for the former was one of those longlimbed
knockkneed shambling bony people to whom it is difficult to assign
any precise agelooking as they do when they are yet boys like
undergrown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys </s>
<s>   the
woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been
to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back </s>
<s> 
her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely
dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel
wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough </s>
<s>   this
circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual
extent enabled him with much ease to keep some halfdozen paces in
advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an
impatient jerk of the head </s>
<s>   as if reproaching her tardiness and
urging her to greater exertion </s>
<s> 

thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any
object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider
passage for the mailcoaches which were whirling out of town until
they passed through highgate archway </s>
<s>  when the foremost traveller
stopped and called impatiently to his companion

come on cant yer </s>
<s>   what a lazybones yer are charlotte </s>
<s> 

its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost
breathless with fatigue </s>
<s> 

heavy </s>
<s>   what are yer talking about </s>
<s>   what are yer made for </s>
<s>  rejoined
the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the
other shoulder </s>
<s>   oh there yer are resting again </s>
<s>  well if yer aint
enough to tire anybodys patience out i dont know what is </s>
<s> 

is it much farther </s>
<s>  asked the woman resting herself against a bank
and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face </s>
<s> 

much farther </s>
<s>   yer as good as there said the longlegged tramper
pointing out before him </s>
<s>   look there </s>
<s>   those are the lights of london </s>
<s> 

theyre a good two mile off at least said the woman despondingly </s>
<s> 

never mind whether theyre two mile off or twenty said noah
claypole </s>
<s>  for he it was </s>
<s>  but get up and come on or ill kick yer and
so i give yer notice </s>
<s> 

as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road
while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution
the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his
side </s>
<s> 

where do you mean to stop for the night noah </s>
<s>  she asked after they
had walked a few hundred yards </s>
<s> 

how should i know </s>
<s>  replied noah whose temper had been considerably
impaired by walking </s>
<s> 

near i hope said charlotte </s>
<s> 

no not near replied <abvr> claypole </s>
<s>   there </s>
<s>   not near </s>
<s>  so dont
think it </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s> 

when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough
without any why or because either replied <abvr> claypole with dignity </s>
<s> 

well you neednt be so cross said his companion </s>
<s> 

a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very
first publichouse outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up
after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart
with handcuffs on said <abvr> claypole in a jeering tone </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   i shall
go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop
till we come to the very outofthewayest house i can set eyes on </s>
<s> 
cod yer may thanks yer stars ive got a head </s>
<s>  for if we hadnt gone
at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yerd
have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady </s>
<s>   and serve yer
right for being a fool </s>
<s> 

i know i aint as cunning as you are replied charlotte </s>
<s>  but dont
put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up </s>
<s>   you
would have been if i had been any way </s>
<s> 

yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte </s>
<s> 

did i keep it </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you
are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm
through his </s>
<s> 

this was indeed the case </s>
<s>  but as it was not <abvr> claypoles habit to
repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be
observed in justice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte
to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be
found on her </s>
<s>   which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his
innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of
escape </s>
<s>   of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of
his motives and they walked on very lovingly together </s>
<s> 

in pursuance of this cautious plan <abvr> claypole went on without
halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely
judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that
london began in earnest </s>
<s>   just pausing to observe which appeared the
most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he
crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of
the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and
smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst
that improvement has left in the midst of london </s>
<s> 

through these streets noah claypole walked dragging charlotte after
him </s>
<s>  now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole
external character of some small publichouse </s>
<s>  now jogging on again as
some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his
purpose </s>
<s>   at length he stopped in front of one more humble in
appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen </s>
<s>  and having crossed
over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced
his intention of putting up there for the night </s>
<s> 

so give us the bundle said noah unstrapping it from the womans
shoulders and slinging it over his own </s>
<s>  and dont yer speak except
when yer spoke to </s>
<s>   whats the name of the housethrthree what </s>
<s> 

cripples said charlotte </s>
<s> 

three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too </s>
<s>   now then </s>
<s> 
keep close at my heels and come along </s>
<s>   with these injunctions he
pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house
followed by his companion </s>
<s> 

there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows
on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper </s>
<s>  he stared very hard at
noah and noah stared very hard at him </s>
<s> 

if noah had been attired in his charityboys dress there might have
been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide </s>
<s>  but as he had
discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smockfrock over his
leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting
so much attention in a publichouse </s>
<s> 

is this the three cripples </s>
<s>  asked noah </s>
<s> 

that is the dabe of this ouse replied the jew </s>
<s> 

a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country
recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her
attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and
perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise </s>
<s>   we want to sleep here
tonight </s>
<s> 

ib dot certaid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite </s>
<s> 
but ill idquire </s>
<s> 

show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
while yer inquiring will yer </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s> 

barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting
the required viands before them </s>
<s>  having done which he informed the
travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable
couple to their refreshment </s>
<s> 

now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps
lower so that any person connected with the house undrawing a small
curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the
lastnamed apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only
look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of
being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between
which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but
could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable
distinctness their subject of conversation </s>
<s>   the landlord of the house
had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes
and barney had only just returned from making the communication above
related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into
the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  said barney </s>
<s>   stradegers id the next roob </s>
<s> 

strangers </s>
<s>  repeated the old man in a whisper </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>   ad rub uds too added barney </s>
<s>   frob the cuttry but subthig in
your way or ib bistaked </s>
<s> 

fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest </s>
<s> 

mounting a stool he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass
from which secret post he could see <abvr> claypole taking cold beef from
the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses
of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his
pleasure </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  he whispered looking round to barney i like that fellows
looks </s>
<s>   hed be of use to us </s>
<s>  he knows how to train the girl already </s>
<s> 
dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em
talklet me hear em </s>
<s> 

he again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the
partition listened attentively </s>
<s>   with a subtle and eager look upon his
face that might have appertained to some old goblin </s>
<s> 

so i mean to be a gentleman said <abvr> claypole kicking out his legs
and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had
arrived too late to hear </s>
<s>  no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a
gentlemans life for me </s>
<s>   and if yer like yer shall be a lady </s>
<s> 

i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte </s>
<s>  but tills
aint to be emptied every day and people to get clear off after it </s>
<s> 

tills be blowed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> claypole </s>
<s>  theres more things besides
tills to be emptied </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  asked his companion </s>
<s> 

pockets womens ridicules houses mailcoaches banks </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
claypole rising with the porter </s>
<s> 

but you cant do all that dear said charlotte </s>
<s> 

i shall look out to get into company with them as can replied noah </s>
<s> 
theyll be able to make us useful some way or another </s>
<s>  why you
yourself are worth fifty women </s>
<s>  i never see such a precious sly and
deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer </s>
<s> 

lor how nice it is to hear yer say so </s>
<s>  exclaimed charlotte
imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face </s>
<s> 

there thatll do </s>
<s>   dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross
with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity </s>
<s>   i
should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of
em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves </s>
<s>   that would suit
me if there was good profit </s>
<s>  and if we could only get in with some
gentleman of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twentypound
note youve gotespecially as we dont very well know how to get rid
of it ourselves </s>
<s> 

after expressing this opinion <abvr> claypole looked into the porterpot
with an aspect of deep wisdom </s>
<s>  and having well shaken its contents
nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught wherewith he
appeared greatly refreshed </s>
<s>   he was meditating another when the sudden
opening of the door and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him </s>
<s> 

the stranger was <abvr> fagin </s>
<s>   and very amiable he looked and a very low
bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest
table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney </s>
<s> 

a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin
rubbing his hands </s>
<s>   from the country i see sir </s>
<s> 

how do yer see that </s>
<s>  asked noah claypole </s>
<s> 

we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing
from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two
bundles </s>
<s> 

yer a sharp feller said noah </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  only hear that charlotte </s>
<s> 

why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew
sinking his voice to a confidential whisper </s>
<s>  and thats the truth </s>
<s> 

fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his
right forefingera gesture which noah attempted to imitate though
not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being
large enough for the purpose </s>
<s>   however <abvr> fagin seemed to interpret
the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and
put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly
manner </s>
<s> 

good stuff that observed <abvr> claypole smacking his lips </s>
<s> 

dear </s>
<s>  said fagin </s>
<s>   a man need be always emptying a till or a
pocket or a womans reticule or a house or a mailcoach or a bank
if he drinks it regularly </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he
fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a
countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror </s>
<s> 

dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 
ha </s>
<s>  it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance </s>
<s>  it was very
lucky it was only me </s>
<s> 

i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs
like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well as he could
under his chair </s>
<s>  it was all her doing </s>
<s>  yerve got it now charlotte
yer know yer have </s>
<s> 

no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin
glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two
bundles </s>
<s>   im in that way myself and i like you for it </s>
<s> 

in what way </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole a little recovering </s>
<s> 

in that way of business rejoined fagin </s>
<s>  and so are the people of
the house </s>
<s>   youve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe
here as you could be </s>
<s>   there is not a safer place in all this town than
is the cripples </s>
<s>  that is when i like to make it so </s>
<s>   and i have taken
a fancy to you and the young woman </s>
<s>  so ive said the word and you may
make your minds easy </s>
<s> 

noah claypoles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but
his body certainly was not </s>
<s>  for he shuffled and writhed about into
various uncouth positions </s>
<s>   eyeing his new friend meanwhile with
mingled fear and suspicion </s>
<s> 

ill tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by
dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements </s>
<s>  i have got a friend
that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right
way where you can take whatever department of the business you think
will suit you best at first and be taught all the others </s>
<s> 

yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah </s>
<s> 

what advantage would it be to me to be anything else </s>
<s>  inquired fagin
shrugging his shoulders </s>
<s>   here </s>
<s>   let me have a word with you outside </s>
<s> 

theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting
his legs by gradual degrees abroad again </s>
<s>  shell take the luggage
upstairs the while </s>
<s>   charlotte see to them bundles </s>
<s> 

this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed
without the slightest demur </s>
<s>  and charlotte made the best of her way off
with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out </s>
<s> 

shes kept tolerably well under aint she </s>
<s>  he asked as he resumed
his seat </s>
<s>   in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal </s>
<s> 

quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  youre
a genius my dear </s>
<s> 

why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah </s>
<s>  but
i say shell be back if yer lose time </s>
<s> 

now what do you think </s>
<s>  said fagin </s>
<s>   if you was to like my friend
could you do better than join him </s>
<s> 

is he in a good way of business </s>
<s>  thats where it is </s>
<s>  responded noah
winking one of his little eyes </s>
<s> 

the top of the tree </s>
<s>  employs a power of hands </s>
<s>  has the very best
society in the profession </s>
<s> 

regular townmaders </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

not a countryman among em </s>
<s>  and i dont think hed take you even on
my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just
now replied fagin </s>
<s> 

should i have to hand over </s>
<s>  said noah slapping his breechespocket </s>
<s> 

it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most
decided manner </s>
<s> 

twenty pound thoughits a lot of money </s>
<s> 

not when its in a note you cant get rid of retorted fagin </s>
<s>  number
and date taken i suppose </s>
<s>   payment stopped at the bank </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>   its not
worth much to him </s>
<s>   itll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it
for a great deal in the market </s>
<s> 

when could i see him </s>
<s>  asked noah doubtfully </s>
<s> 

tomorrow morning </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s> 

here </s>
<s> 

um </s>
<s>  said noah </s>
<s>   whats the wages </s>
<s> 

live like a gentlemanboard and lodging pipes and spirits freehalf
of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied <abvr>
fagin </s>
<s> 

whether noah claypole whose rapacity was none of the least
comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he
been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful </s>
<s>  but as he recollected
that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new
acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely
things had come to pass he gradually relented and said he thought
that would suit him </s>
<s> 

but yer see observed noah as she will be able to do a good deal
i should like to take something very light </s>
<s> 

a little fancy work </s>
<s>  suggested fagin </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  something of that sort replied noah </s>
<s>   what do you think would
suit me now </s>
<s>   something not too trying for the strength and not very
dangerous you know </s>
<s>   thats the sort of thing </s>
<s> 

i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my
dear said fagin </s>
<s>   my friend wants somebody who would do that well
very much </s>
<s> 

why i did mention that and i shouldnt mind turning my hand to it
sometimes rejoined <abvr> claypole slowly </s>
<s>  but it wouldnt pay by
itself you know </s>
<s> 

thats true </s>
<s>  observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate </s>
<s> 
no it might not </s>
<s> 

what do you think then </s>
<s>  asked noah anxiously regarding him </s>
<s> 
something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not
much more risk than being at home </s>
<s> 

what do you think of the old ladies </s>
<s>  asked fagin </s>
<s>  theres a good
deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running
round the corner </s>
<s> 

dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes </s>
<s>  asked noah
shaking his head </s>
<s>   i dont think that would answer my purpose </s>
<s>   aint
there any other line open </s>
<s> 

stop </s>
<s>  said fagin laying his hand on noahs knee </s>
<s>   the kinchin lay </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> claypole </s>
<s> 

the kinchins my dear said fagin is the young children thats sent
on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings </s>
<s>  and the lay
is just to take their money awaytheyve always got it ready in their
handsthen knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if
there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt
itself </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  roared <abvr> claypole kicking up his legs in an ecstasy </s>
<s> 
lord thats the very thing </s>
<s> 

to be sure it is replied fagin </s>
<s>  and you can have a few good beats
chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like
that where theyre always going errands </s>
<s>  and you can upset as many
kinchins as you want any hour in the day </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

with this fagin poked <abvr> claypole in the side and they joined in a
burst of laughter both long and loud </s>
<s> 

well thats all right </s>
<s>  said noah when he had recovered himself and
charlotte had returned </s>
<s>   what time tomorrow shall we say </s>
<s> 

will ten do </s>

what name shall i tell my good friend </s>

emergency </s>

politeness </s>

with many adieus and good wishes <abvr> fagin went his way </s>
<s>  noah
claypole bespeaking his good ladys attention proceeded to enlighten
her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness

the kinchin lay in london and its vicinity </s>

<s>   number one for ever </s>
<s> 

in a little community like ours my dear said fagin who felt it
necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one
without considering me too as the same and all the other young people </s>
<s> 

oh the devil </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> bolter </s>
<s> 

you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we
are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must
be so </s>
<s>   for instance its your object to take care of number
onemeaning yourself </s>
<s> 

certainly replied <abvr> bolter </s>
<s>   yer about right there </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>   you cant take care of yourself number one without taking
care of me number one </s>
<s> 

number two you mean said <abvr> bolter who was largely endowed with
the quality of selfishness </s>
<s> 

no i dont </s>
<s>  retorted fagin </s>
<s>   im of the same importance to you as
you are to yourself </s>
<s> 

i say interrupted <abvr> bolter yer a very nice man and im very
fond of yer </s>
<s>  but we aint quite so thick together as all that comes
to </s>
<s> 

only think said fagin shrugging his shoulders and stretching out
his hands </s>
<s>  only consider </s>
<s>   youve done whats a very pretty thing and
what i love you for doing </s>
<s>  but what at the same time would put the
cravat round your throat thats so very easily tied and so very
difficult to unloosein plain english the halter </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bolter put his hand to his neckerchief as if he felt it
inconveniently tight </s>
<s>  and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not
in substance </s>
<s> 

the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly
fingerpost which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway </s>
<s>   to keep in
the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with
you </s>
<s> 

of course it is replied <abvr> bolter </s>
<s>   what do yer talk about such
things for </s>
<s> 

only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his
eyebrows </s>
<s>   to be able to do that you depend upon me </s>
<s>  to keep my
little business all snug i depend upon you </s>
<s>  the first is your number
one the second my number one </s>
<s>   the more you value your number one the
more careful you must be of mine </s>
<s>  so we come at last to what i told you
at firstthat a regard for number one holds us all together and must
do so unless we would all go to pieces in company </s>
<s> 

thats true rejoined <abvr> bolter thoughtfully </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  yer a cunning
old codger </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no
mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a
sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should
entertain in the outset of their acquaintance </s>
<s>   to strengthen an
impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by
acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his
operations </s>
<s>  blending truth and fiction together as best served his
purpose </s>
<s>  and bringing both to bear with so much art that <abvr> bolters
respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with
a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken </s>
<s> 

its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
heavy losses said fagin </s>
<s>   my best hand was taken from me yesterday
morning </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to say he died </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> bolter </s>
<s> 

no no replied fagin not so bad as that </s>
<s>   not quite so bad </s>

what i suppose he was

wanted interposed fagin </s>

very particular </s>

no replied fagin not very </s>
<s>   he was charged with attempting to pick
a pocket and they found a silver snuffbox on himhis own my dear
his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it </s>

remanded him till today for they thought they knew the owner </s>

<s>  he
was worth fifty boxes and id give the price of as many to have him
back </s>
<s>   you should have known the dodger my dear </s>
<s>  you should have known
the dodger </s>
<s> 

well but i shall know him i hope </s>
<s>  dont yer think so </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
bolter </s>
<s> 

im doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh </s>
<s>   if they dont
get any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we
shall have him back again after six weeks or so </s>
<s>  but if they do its
a case of lagging </s>
<s>   they know what a clever lad he is </s>
<s>  hell be a
lifer </s>
<s>   theyll make the artful nothing less than a lifer </s>
<s> 

what do you mean by lagging and a lifer </s>
<s>  demanded <abvr> bolter </s>
<s>  whats
the good of talking in that way to me </s>
<s>  why dont yer speak so as i can
understand yer </s>
<s> 

fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the
vulgar tongue </s>
<s>  and being interpreted <abvr> bolter would have been
informed that they represented that combination of words
transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry
of master bates with his hands in his breechespockets and his face
twisted into a look of semicomical woe </s>
<s> 

its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had
been made known to each other </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s> 

theyve found the gentleman as owns the box </s>
<s>  two or three mores a
coming to dentify him </s>

<s> 
oh why didnt he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables and
go out as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour

<s> 

with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master
bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
despondency </s>
<s> 

what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for </s>
<s> 
exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil </s>

not one replied master bates in a voice rendered husky by regret </s>

not one </s>

then what do you talk of </s>

cause it isnt on the record is it </s>

perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets </s>

bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the
palsy </s>

<s>   aint
it beautiful </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bolter nodded assent and fagin after contemplating the grief of
charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to
that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder </s>
<s> 

never mind charley said fagin soothingly </s>

sure to come out </s>

well it is a honour that is </s>

he shall have all he wants continued the jew </s>

ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  laughed master bates what a lark that would be wouldnt
it fagin </s>

<s> 

would </s>
<s>  cried fagin </s>
<s>   he shallhe will </s>
<s> 

ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands </s>
<s> 

i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his pupil </s>
<s> 

so do i cried charley bates </s>
<s>   ha </s>

<s>  so do i </s>
<s>   i see it all
afore me upon my soul i do fagin </s>

<s> 
all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of
em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges own son making
a speech arter dinnerha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s>  ha </s>
<s> 

in fact <abvr> fagin had so well humoured his young friends eccentric
disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to
consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now
looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and
exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time
when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of
displaying his abilities </s>
<s> 

we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other
said fagin </s>
<s>   let me think </s>
<s> 

shall i go </s>
<s>  asked charley </s>

not for the world replied fagin </s>
<s>   are you mad my dear stark mad
that youd walk into the very place whereno charley no </s>
<s>  one is
enough to lose at a time </s>
<s> 

you dont mean to go yourself i suppose </s>
<s>  said charley with a
humorous leer </s>
<s> 

that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head </s>
<s> 

then why dont you send this new cove </s>
<s>  asked master bates laying his
hand on noahs arm </s>
<s>   nobody knows him </s>
<s> 

why if he didnt mind observed fagin </s>
<s> 

mind </s>
<s>  interposed charley </s>
<s>   what should he have to mind </s>
<s> 

really nothing my dear said fagin turning to <abvr> bolter really
nothing </s>
<s> 

oh i dare say about that yer know observed noah backing towards
the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm </s>
<s>   no
nonone of that </s>
<s>   its not in my department that aint </s>
<s> 

wot department has he got fagin </s>
<s>  inquired master bates surveying
noahs lank form with much disgust </s>
<s>   the cutting away when theres
anything wrong and the eating all the wittles when theres everything
right </s>
<s>  is that his branch </s>
<s> 

never mind retorted <abvr> bolter </s>
<s>  and dont yer take liberties with
yer superiors little boy or yerll find yerself in the wrong shop </s>
<s> 

master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it
was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to <abvr> bolter
that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the policeoffice </s>
<s> 
that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had
engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to
the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of
having resorted to it for shelter </s>
<s>  and that if he were properly
disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in
london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which
he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will </s>
<s> 

persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much
greater degree by his fear of fagin <abvr> bolter at length consented
with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition </s>
<s>  by fagins
directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoners
frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings </s>
<s>   all of which articles
the jew had at hand </s>
<s>   he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well
garnished with turnpike tickets </s>
<s>  and a carters whip </s>
<s>   thus equipped
he was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent
garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his
curiousity </s>
<s>  and as he was as awkward ungainly and rawboned a fellow
as need be <abvr> fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to
perfection </s>
<s> 

these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs
and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by
master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short
distance of bow street </s>
<s>  having described the precise situation of the
office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk
straight up the passage and when he got into the side and pull off
his hat as he went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on
alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting </s>
<s> 

noah claypole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually
followed the directions he had received whichmaster bates being
pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was
enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question
or meeting with any interruption by the way </s>
<s> 

he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who
were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room at the upper end of which
was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the
prisoners on the left hand against the wall a box for the witnesses in
the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right </s>
<s>  the awful
locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed
the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they
could the full majesty of justice </s>
<s> 

there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to
their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a
couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the
table </s>
<s>   a jailer stood reclining against the dockrail tapping his
nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue
tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence </s>
<s>  or
looked sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the
gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries halfsmothered in the
mothers shawl from some meagre infant </s>
<s>   the room smelt close and
unwholesome </s>
<s>  the walls were dirtdiscoloured </s>
<s>  and the ceiling
blackened </s>
<s>   there was an old smoky bust over the mantelshelf and a
dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present that seemed to go
on as it ought </s>
<s>  for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance
with both had left a taint on all the animate matter hardly less
unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that
frowned upon it </s>
<s> 

noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger </s>
<s>  but although there were
several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be
supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all
answering the description given him of <abvr> dawkins was to be seen </s>
<s>   he
waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women
being committed for trial went flaunting out </s>
<s>  and then was quickly
relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once
could be no other than the object of his visit </s>
<s> 

it was indeed <abvr> dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big
coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left hand in his pocket and his
hat in his right hand preceded the jailer with a rolling gait
altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested
in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful
sitivation for </s>
<s> 

hold your tongue will you </s>
<s>  said the jailer </s>
<s> 

im an englishman aint i </s>
<s>  rejoined the dodger </s>

priwileges </s>
<s> 

youll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and
pepper with em </s>

well see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to
say to the beaks if i dont replied <abvr> dawkins </s>

of my word and wery punctual in business matters hell go away if i
aint there to my time and then praps ther wont be an action for
damage against them as kep me away </s>
<s>   oh no certainly not </s>
<s> 

at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a
view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to
communicate the names of them two files as was on the bench </s>
<s>   which
so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as
master bates could have done if he had heard the request </s>
<s> 

silence there </s>
<s>  cried the jailer </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s>  inquired one of the magistrates </s>
<s> 

a pickpocketing case your worship </s>
<s> 

has the boy ever been here before </s>
<s> 

he ought to have been a many times replied the jailer </s>
<s>  he has been
pretty well everywhere else </s>
<s>   i know him well your worship </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you know me do you </s>
<s>  cried the artful making a note of the
statement </s>
<s>   wery good </s>
<s>   thats a case of deformation of character any
way </s>

here there was another laugh and another cry of silence </s>
<s> 

now then where are the witnesses </s>
<s>  said the clerk </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thats right added the dodger </s>
<s>   where are they </s>
<s>   i should like
to see em </s>
<s> 

this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward
who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in
a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very
old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own
countenance </s>
<s>   for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon
as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon
his person a silver snuffbox with the owners name engraved upon the
lid </s>
<s>   this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court
guide and being then and there present swore that the snuffbox was
his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had
disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to </s>
<s>   he had also
remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making
his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him </s>
<s> 

have you anything to ask this witness boy </s>
<s>  said the magistrate </s>
<s> 

i wouldnt abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with
him replied the dodger </s>

jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow </s>

i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an air of
abstraction </s>

palm of his hand </s>

<s>   i

with these last words the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the
collar </s>
<s>  threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary
business of it </s>
<s>  and then grinning in the officers face with great
glee and selfapproval </s>

having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell noah made the
best of his way back to where he had left master bates </s>

here some time he was joined by that young gentleman who had
prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully
abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new friend had not
been followed by any impertinent person </s>

the two hastened back together to bear to <abvr> fagin the animating news
that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringingup and
establishing for himself a glorious reputation </s>

fails </s>
<s> 

adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the
girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of
the step she had taken wrought upon her mind </s>
<s>   she remembered that
both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes
which had been hidden from all others </s>
<s>  in the full confidence that she
was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion </s>
<s>   vile as those
schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were
her feelings towards fagin who had led her step by step deeper and
deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape </s>
<s> 
still there were times when even towards him she felt some
relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp
he had so long eluded and he should fall at lastrichly as he merited
such a fateby her hand </s>
<s> 

but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix
itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by
any consideration </s>
<s>   her fears for sikes would have been more powerful
inducements to recoil while there was yet time </s>
<s>  but she had stipulated
that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which
could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a
refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses herand
what more could she do </s>
<s>  she was resolved </s>
<s> 

though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they
forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too </s>
<s> 
she grew pale and thin even within a few days </s>
<s>   at times she took no
heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where
once she would have been the loudest </s>
<s>   at other times she laughed
without merriment and was noisy without a moment afterwardsshe sat
silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the
very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even
these indications that she was ill at ease and that her thoughts were
occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the
course of discussion by her companions </s>

<s>  cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground </s>
<s>

<s>  repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her </s>
<s> 
aye </s>
<s>   and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have
such a grip on your throat asll tear some of that screaming voice out </s>
<s> 
wot has come over you you jade </s>
<s>   wot is it </s>
<s> 

let me go said the girl with great earnestness </s>
<s>  then sitting herself
down on the floor before the door she said bill let me go </s>
<s>  you
dont know what you are doing </s>
<s>  you dont indeed </s>
<s>   for only one
hourdodo </s>
<s> 

cut my limbs off one by one </s>

arm if i dont think the gals stark raving mad </s>
<s>   get up </s>
<s> 

not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever </s>
<s> 
screamed the girl </s>
<s>   sikes looked on for a minute watching his
opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling
and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where
he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her
down by force </s>
<s>   she struggled and implored by turns until twelve
oclock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest
the point any further </s>
<s>   with a caution backed by many oaths to make
no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at
leisure and rejoined fagin </s>
<s> 

whew </s>
<s>  said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face </s>
<s> 
wot a precious strange gal that is </s>
<s> 

you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully </s>
<s>   you may say
that </s>
<s> 

wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you
think </s>
<s>  asked sikes </s>
<s>   come </s>
<s>  you should know her better than me </s>
<s>  wot
does it mean </s>
<s> 

obstinacy </s>
<s>  womans obstinacy i suppose my dear </s>
<s> 

well i suppose it is growled sikes </s>
<s>   i thought i had tamed her
but shes as bad as ever </s>
<s> 

worse said fagin thoughtfully </s>
<s>   i never knew her like this for
such a little cause </s>
<s> 

nor i said sikes </s>
<s>   i think shes got a touch of that fever in her
blood yet and it wont come outeh </s>
<s> 

like enough </s>
<s> 

ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes
took that way again said sikes </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment </s>
<s> 

she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched
on my back </s>
<s>  and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself
aloof said sikes </s>
<s>   we was poor too all the time and i think one
way or other its worried and fretted her </s>
<s>  and that being shut up here
so long has made her restlesseh </s>
<s> 

thats it my dear replied the jew in a whisper </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 

as he uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her
former seat </s>
<s>   her eyes were swollen and red </s>
<s>  she rocked herself to and
fro </s>
<s>  tossed her head </s>
<s>  and after a little time burst out laughing </s>
<s> 

why now shes on the other tack </s>
<s>  exclaimed sikes turning a look of
excessive surprise on his companion </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then </s>
<s>  and in a few
minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour </s>
<s>  whispering
sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat
and bade him goodnight </s>
<s>   he paused when he reached the roomdoor and
looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs </s>
<s> 

light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe </s>
<s>  its a pity he
should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers </s>
<s>   show
him a light </s>
<s> 

nancy followed the old man downstairs with a candle </s>
<s>   when they
reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close
to the girl said in a whisper </s>
<s> 

what is it nancy dear </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  replied the girl in the same tone </s>
<s> 

the reason of all this replied fagin </s>
<s>   if hehe pointed with
his skinny forefinger up the stairsis so hard with you hes a
brute nance a brutebeast why dont you

well </s>
<s>  said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching
her ear and his eyes looking into hers </s>
<s> 

no matter just now </s>
<s>   well talk of this again </s>
<s>   you have a friend in
me nance </s>
<s>  a staunch friend </s>
<s>   i have the means at hand quiet and
close </s>
<s>   if you want revenge on those that treat you like a doglike a
dog </s>
<s>   worse than his dog for he humours him sometimescome to me </s>
<s>   i
say come to me </s>
<s>   he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of
old nance </s>
<s> 

i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least
emotion </s>
<s>   goodnight </s>
<s> 

she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said
goodnight again in a steady voice and answering his parting look
with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them </s>
<s> 

fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were
working within his brain </s>
<s>   he had conceived the ideanot from what had
just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by
degreesthat nancy wearied of the housebreakers brutality had
conceived an attachment for some new friend </s>
<s>   her altered manner her
repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the
interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and
added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him
at least almost matter of certainty </s>
<s>   the object of this new liking
was not among his myrmidons </s>
<s>   he would be a valuable acquisition with
such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured
without delay </s>
<s> 

there was another and a darker object to be gained </s>
<s>   sikes knew too
much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the
wounds were hidden </s>
<s>   the girl must know well that if she shook him
off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely
wreakedto the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of lifeon the
object of her more recent fancy </s>
<s> 

with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that
she would consent to poison him </s>
<s>   women have done such things and
worse to secure the same object before now </s>
<s>   there would be the
dangerous villain </s>
<s>   the man i hate </s>
<s>   gone </s>
<s>  another secured in his
place </s>
<s>  and my influence over the girl with a knowledge of this crime
to back it unlimited </s>
<s> 

these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he
sat alone in the housebreakers room </s>
<s>  and with them uppermost in his
thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of
sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting </s>
<s>   there
was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to
understand his meaning </s>
<s>   the girl clearly comprehended it </s>
<s>   her glance
at parting showed that </s>
<s> 

but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and
that was one of the chief ends to be attained </s>
<s>  how thought fagin as
he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her </s>
<s>   what new
power can i acquire </s>
<s> 

such brains are fertile in expedients </s>
<s>   if without extracting a
confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her
altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of
whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs
could he not secure her compliance </s>
<s> 

i can said fagin almost aloud </s>
<s>   she durst not refuse me then </s>
<s>   not
for her life not for her life </s>
<s>   i have it all </s>
<s>   the means are ready
and shall be set to work </s>
<s>   i shall have you yet </s>
<s> 

he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards
the spot where he had left the bolder villain </s>
<s>  and went on his way </s>
<s> 
busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he
wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy
crushed with every motion of his fingers </s>

chapter xlv

noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission

the old man was up betimes next morning and waited impatiently for
the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed
interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious
assault on the breakfast </s>

there seemed indeed no great fear of anything interrupting him as he

milkcan was a perfect masterpiece </s>

pretty well i think for a beginner remarked <abvr> bolter
complacently </s>

fagin affected to laugh very heartily </s>

laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk
of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second </s>

i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a

a young one replied fagin </s>

i can do that pretty well i know said bolter </s>

his employer eagerly in the face </s>

if you do it well a pound my dear </s>

all that my dear you shall hear from me </s>

proper time said fagin </s>

that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and
equipped in his carters dress </s>
<s>   ready to turn out at a word from
fagin </s>
<s>   six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin
came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was
not yet time </s>

exultation he could not conceal </s>
<s>   it was sunday </s>
<s> 

she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im
sure </s>

not be back much before daybreak </s>
<s>   come with me </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s> 

noah started up without saying a word </s>
<s>  for the jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him </s>
<s>   they left the house
stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at
length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in
which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london </s>
<s> 

it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed </s>
<s>   it opened softly
on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle </s>
<s>  they entered without noise </s>
<s> 
and the door was closed behind them </s>
<s> 

scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words
fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of
glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in
the adjoining room </s>
<s> 

is that the woman </s>
<s>  he asked scarcely above his breath </s>
<s> 

fagin nodded yes </s>
<s> 

i cant see her face well whispered noah </s>

the candle is behind her </s>

stay there whispered fagin </s>

an instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of
snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking
to the girl caused her to raise her face </s>

i see her now cried the spy </s>

plainly </s>
<s> 

i should know her among a thousand </s>

he hastily descended as the roomdoor opened and the girl came out </s>

fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and
they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered </s>

noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out </s>

to the left whispered the lad </s>

other side </s>
<s> 

he did so </s>
<s>  and by the light of the lamps saw the girls retreating
figure already at some distance before him </s>
<s>   he advanced as near as he
considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the
better to observe her motions </s>
<s>  she looked nervously round twice or
thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
her pass on </s>
<s>   she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to
walk with a steadier and firmer step </s>

relative distance between them and followed </s>

chapter xlvi

the appointment kept

the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures
emerged on london bridge </s>
<s>   one which advanced with a swift and rapid
step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in
quest of some expected object </s>
<s>  the other figure was that of a man who
slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance
accommodated his pace to hers </s>
<s>   stopping when she stopped </s>
<s>   and as she
moved again creeping stealthily on </s>
<s>   but never allowing himself in
the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps </s>
<s>   thus they
crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the
woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the
footpassengers turned back </s>
<s>   the movement was sudden </s>
<s>  but he who
watched her was not thrown off his guard by it </s>
<s>  for shrinking into
one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning
over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to
pass on the opposite pavement </s>
<s>  when she was about the same distance in
advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed
her again </s>
<s>  at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped </s>
<s>   the man
stopped too </s>
<s> 

it was a very dark night </s>
<s>   the day had been unfavourable and at that
hour and place there were few people stirring </s>
<s>  such as there were
hurried quickly past </s>
<s>   very possibly without seeing but certainly
without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view </s>
<s> 
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way
over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless
hovel wherein to lay their heads </s>
<s>  they stood there in silence </s>
<s>   neither
speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed </s>
<s> 

a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks </s>
<s> 
the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull
from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water
too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes </s>
<s>  the tower of old
saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the
giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom </s>
<s>  but the
forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of
churches above were nearly all hidden from sight </s>
<s> 

the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched
meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st </s>
<s>  pauls
tolled for the death of another day </s>
<s>   midnight had come upon the
crowded city </s>
<s>   the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse </s>
<s> 
the chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face
of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child </s>
<s>   midnight was upon them
all </s>
<s> 

the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by
a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a
short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked
straight towards it </s>
<s>   they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement
when the girl started and immediately made towards them </s>
<s> 

they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who
entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate </s>
<s> 
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it
immediately </s>
<s>  for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment </s>
<s> 

not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here </s>
<s> 
come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder </s>
<s> 

as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction
in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on </s>
<s> 

the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the
surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours
church form a landingstairs from the river </s>
<s>   to this spot the man
bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved </s>
<s>  and after
a moments survey of the place he began to descend </s>
<s> 

these stairs are a part of the bridge </s>
<s>  they consist of three flights </s>
<s> 
just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the
left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames </s>
<s> 
at this point the lower steps widen </s>
<s>   so that a person turning that
angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs
who chance to be above him if only a step </s>
<s>  the countryman looked
hastily round when he reached this point </s>
<s>  and as there seemed no
better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty
of room he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there
waited </s>
<s>   pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if
he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with
safety </s>
<s> 

so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he
had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for
lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or
had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
conversation </s>
<s>   he was on the point of emerging from his hidingplace
and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and
directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear </s>
<s> 

he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely
breathing listened attentively </s>
<s> 

this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the
gentleman </s>
<s>   i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther </s>
<s>   many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but
you see i am willing to humour you </s>
<s> 

to humour me </s>
<s>  cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed </s>
<s> 
youre considerate indeed sir </s>
<s>   to humour me </s>
<s>   well well its no
matter </s>
<s> 

why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose
can you have brought us to this strange place </s>
<s>   why not have let me
speak to you above there where it is light and there is something
stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole </s>
<s> 

i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you
there </s>
<s>   i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have
such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand </s>
<s> 

a fear of what </s>
<s>  asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her </s>
<s> 

i scarcely know of what replied the girl </s>
<s>   i wish i did </s>
<s>  horrible
thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that
has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day </s>
<s>   i was
reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things
came into the print </s>
<s> 

imagination said the gentleman soothing her </s>
<s> 

no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice </s>
<s>  ill swear i saw
coffin written in every page of the book in large black
lettersaye and they carried one close to me in the streets
tonight </s>
<s> 

there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman </s>
<s>  they have
passed me often </s>
<s> 

real ones rejoined the girl </s>
<s>   this was not </s>
<s> 

there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the
concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and
the blood chilled within him </s>
<s>   he had never experienced a greater
relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged
her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such
fearful fancies </s>
<s> 

speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion </s>
<s>  poor
creature </s>
<s>   she seems to need it </s>
<s> 

your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the
girl </s>
<s>   oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks
as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth
and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud
instead of so much humbler </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the gentleman </s>
<s>   a turk turns his face after washing it
well to the east when he says his prayers </s>
<s>  these good people after
giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles
off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven </s>
<s> 
between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first </s>
<s> 

these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were
perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover
herself </s>
<s>   the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her </s>
<s> 

you were not here last sunday night he said </s>
<s> 

i couldnt come replied nancy </s>
<s>  i was kept by force </s>
<s> 

by whom </s>
<s> 

him that i told the young lady of before </s>
<s> 

you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope </s>
<s>  asked the old
gentleman </s>
<s> 

no replied the girl shaking her head </s>
<s>   its not very easy for me
to leave him unless he knows why </s>
<s>  i couldnt give him a drink of
laudanum before i came away </s>
<s> 

did he awake before you returned </s>
<s>  inquired the gentleman </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  and neither he nor any of them suspect me </s>
<s> 

good said the gentleman </s>
<s>   now listen to me </s>
<s> 

i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment </s>
<s> 

this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to
some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly
a fortnight since </s>
<s>   i confess to you that i had doubts at first
whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe
you are </s>
<s> 

i am said the girl earnestly </s>
<s> 

i repeat that i firmly believe it </s>
<s>   to prove to you that i am disposed
to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the
secret whatever it may be from the fear of this man monks </s>
<s>   but
ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured
cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew </s>
<s> 

fagin cried the girl recoiling </s>
<s> 

that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman </s>
<s> 

i will not do it </s>
<s>   i will never do it </s>
<s>  replied the girl </s>
<s>  devil that
he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that </s>
<s> 

you will not </s>
<s>  said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this
answer </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  returned the girl </s>
<s> 

tell me why </s>
<s> 

for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the
lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her
promise </s>
<s>   and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has
led i have led a bad life too </s>
<s>  there are many of us who have kept the
same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of
themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are </s>
<s> 

then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he
had been aiming to attain </s>
<s>  put monks into my hands and leave him to
me to deal with </s>
<s> 

what if he turns against the others </s>
<s> 

i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him
there the matter will rest </s>
<s>  there must be circumstances in olivers
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye
and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free </s>
<s>

then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to
justice without your consent </s>

monks would never learn how you knew what you do </s>

never replied the gentleman </s>

i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the
girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words </s>
<s> 

after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so
she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by
name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that
night </s>
<s>   from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared
as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
communicated </s>

place the best position from which to watch it without exciting
observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the
habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for

her recollection </s>

he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout </s>

he has a lurking walk </s>

shoulder first on one side and then on the other </s>

that you might almost tell him by that alone </s>

his hair and eyes </s>

twenty withered and haggard </s>

disfigured with the marks of teeth </s>

the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious
of having done so and begged her to proceed </s>
<s> 

part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at

now he said returning </s>

<s> 

nothing replied nancy </s>

you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a

nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping </s>

she will be persuaded now cried the young lady </s>

i fear not my dear said the gentleman </s>

no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle </s>

it </s>

again </s>

safety perhaps by staying here </s>

yes yes urged the girl </s>

do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing </s>

the gentleman turned away </s>

<s> 

the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some
discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to
determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested </s>
<s> 

the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased </s>
<s> 

the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
appeared upon the bridge </s>

rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his
and led her with gentle force away </s>
<s>   as they disappeared the girl
sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and
vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears </s>

after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street </s>
<s>   the astonished listener remained motionless on his post
for some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious
glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his
hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in
the same manner as he had descended </s>

chapter xlvii

fatal consequences

it was nearly two hours before daybreak </s>
<s>  that time which in the autumn
of the year may be truly called the dead of night </s>
<s>  when the streets
are silent and deserted </s>
<s>  when even sounds appear to slumber and
profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream </s>
<s>  it was at this still
and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so
distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less
like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and
worried by an evil spirit </s>
<s> 

he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet
with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his side </s>
<s>   his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed
in thought he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his
toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats </s>
<s> 

stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep </s>
<s> 
towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and
then brought them back again to the candle </s>
<s>  which with a longburnt
wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon
the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere </s>
<s> 

indeed they were </s>
<s>   mortification at the overthrow of his notable
scheme </s>
<s>  hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers </s>
<s>  and
utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up </s>
<s>  bitter
disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes </s>
<s>  the fear of
detection and ruin and death </s>
<s>  and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all </s>
<s>  these were the passionate considerations which following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain
of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his
heart </s>
<s> 

he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take
the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted
by a footstep in the street </s>
<s> 

at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth </s>
<s>  at last </s>
<s> 

the bell rang gently as he spoke </s>
<s>   he crept upstairs to the door and
presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who
carried a bundle under one arm </s>
<s>  sitting down and throwing back his
outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  he said laying the bundle on the table </s>
<s>   take care of that
and do the most you can with it </s>
<s>   its been trouble enough to get </s>
<s>  i
thought i should have been here three hours ago </s>
<s> 

fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard
sat down again without speaking </s>
<s>   but he did not take his eyes off the
robber for an instant during this action </s>
<s>  and now that they sat over
against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his
lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions
which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back
his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright </s>
<s> 

wot now </s>
<s>  cried sikes </s>
<s>   wot do you look at a man so for </s>
<s> 

fagin raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the
air </s>
<s>  but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the
moment gone </s>
<s> 

damme </s>
<s>  said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm </s>
<s>  hes
gone mad </s>
<s>   i must look to myself here </s>

no no rejoined fagin finding his voice </s>
<s>   its notyoure not the
person bill </s>

ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket </s>

lost </s>
<s>  cried fagin </s>
<s>   she has pretty well settled that in her own
mind already </s>
<s> 

sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face
and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched
his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly </s>
<s> 

speak will you </s>

<s>  or if you dont it shall be for want of
breath </s>

with rage </s>

<s>   if he was left
alive till i came id grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot
into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head </s>

much and could hang so many besides myself </s>

the mere suggestion </s>
<s>   id do something in the jail that ud get me put
in irons </s>
<s>  and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with
them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people </s>

fagin looked hard at the robber </s>
<s>  and motioning him to be silent
stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse
him </s>

<s>   looking on with his hands upon
his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and
preparation was to end in </s>

fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him
into a sitting posture </s>

several times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked
sleepily about him </s>

flinging the old man from him he rushed from the room and darted
wildly and furiously up the stairs </s>
<s> 

bill bill </s>
<s>  cried fagin following him hastily </s>
<s>   a word </s>
<s>  only a
word </s>
<s> 

the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was
unable to open the door </s>

violence when the jew came panting up </s>

the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see
each others faces </s>

in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken </s>

i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now
useless not too violent for safety </s>

bold </s>
<s> 

sikes made no reply </s>
<s>  but pulling open the door of which fagin had
turned the lock dashed into the silent streets </s>
<s> 

without one pause or moments consideration </s>
<s>  without once turning his
head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering
them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage
resolution </s>
<s>   his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw
seemed starting through his skin </s>
<s>  the robber held on his headlong
course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his
own door </s>
<s>   he opened it softly with a key </s>
<s>  strode lightly up the
stairs </s>
<s>  and entering his own room doublelocked the door and lifting
a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed </s>

the girl was lying halfdressed upon it </s>

it is you bill </s>

return </s>
<s> 

it is was the reply </s>

<s> 

there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the
candlestick and hurled it under the grate </s>
<s>   seeing the faint light of
early day without the girl rose to undraw the curtain </s>

let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her </s>
<s>  theres enough
light for wot ive got to do </s>

bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like
that at me </s>
<s> 

the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils
and heaving breast </s>
<s>  and then grasping her by the head and throat
dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the
door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth </s>

gentleman and that dear lady told me tonight of a home in some

time </s>

the housebreaker freed one arm and grasped his pistol </s>

summon upon the upturned face that almost touched his own </s>

she staggered and fell </s>

substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some
fearful thing </s>

he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the
outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along </s>

could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of
wind came laden with that last low cry </s>

<s>   that would have been a
relief </s>

behind nowalways </s>

it stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky </s>

himself upon the roadon his back upon the road </s>

stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph
in blood </s>

minute of that agony of fear </s>

night </s>

very dark within </s>

he could not walk on till daylight came again </s>

himself close to the wallto undergo new torture </s>

in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when

and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder </s>
<s>   any sound of men
in that lonely place even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm

prospect of personal danger </s>

open air </s>

the broad sky seemed on fire </s>
<s>   rising into the air with showers of
sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting
the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the
direction where he stood </s>

of an alarmbell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames

refreshed by food </s>

people theremen and womenlight bustle </s>

with loud and sounding bark before him </s>

he came upon the spot </s>
<s>   there were halfdressed figures tearing to and
fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables

coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks
and the tumbling down of redhot beams </s>

windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire </s>
<s>  walls
rocked and crumbled into the burning well </s>
<s>  the molten lead and iron
poured down white hot upon the ground </s>
<s>   women and children shrieked
and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers </s>
<s>   the
clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water
as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar </s>
<s>   he
shouted too till he was hoarse </s>
<s>  and flying from memory and himself
plunged into the thickest of the throng </s>
<s>   hither and thither he dived
that night </s>
<s>   now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the
smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
men were thickest </s>
<s>   up and down the ladders upon the roofs of
buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under
the lee of falling bricks and stones in every part of that great fire
was he </s>
<s>  but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise
nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke
and blackened ruins remained </s>
<s> 

this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the
dreadful consciousness of his crime </s>
<s>   he looked suspiciously about him
for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject
of their talk </s>
<s>   the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and
they drew off stealthily together </s>
<s>   he passed near an engine where
some men were seated and they called to him to share in their
refreshment </s>

<s>  and as he drank a draught of
beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the
murder </s>
<s>   he has gone to birmingham they say said one </s>
<s>   but theyll
have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell

he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground </s>
<s>  then
lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep </s>
<s>   he
wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the
fear of another solitary night </s>

a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
fixed on for his destination </s>

resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond </s>

to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and
started back </s>

called him again </s>

expectation that he would return </s>

chapter l

the pursuit and escape

near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe
abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on
the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
closebuilt lowroofed houses there exists the filthiest the
strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are
hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of
its inhabitants </s>
<s> 

to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of
close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest
of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to
occasion </s>
<s>   the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
shops </s>
<s>  the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
the salesmans door and stream from the houseparapet and windows </s>
<s> 
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class
ballastheavers coalwhippers brazen women ragged children and the
raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along
assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which
branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of
ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
of warehouses that rise from every corner </s>
<s>   arriving at length in
streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has
passed he walks beneath tottering housefronts projecting over the
pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes chimneys
half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron
bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign
of desolation and neglect </s>
<s> 

in such a neighborhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark
stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet
deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill
pond but known in the days of this story as folly ditch </s>
<s>   it is a
creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water
by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old
name </s>
<s>   at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden
bridges thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the
houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows
buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the
water up </s>
<s>  and when his eye is turned from these operations to the
houses themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene
before him </s>
<s>   crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen
houses with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath </s>
<s>  windows
broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen
that is never there </s>
<s>  rooms so small so filthy so confined that the
air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they
shelter </s>
<s>  wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and
threatening to fall into itas some have done </s>
<s>  dirtbesmeared walls
and decaying foundations </s>
<s>  every repulsive lineament of poverty every
loathsome indication of filth rot and garbage </s>
<s>  all these ornament the
banks of folly ditch </s>
<s> 

in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty </s>
<s>  the walls are
crumbling down </s>
<s>  the windows are windows no more </s>
<s>  the doors are falling
into the streets </s>
<s>  the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke </s>
<s> 
thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon
it it was a thriving place </s>
<s>  but now it is a desolate island indeed </s>
<s> 
the houses have no owners </s>
<s>  they are broken open and entered upon by
those who have the courage </s>
<s>  and there they live and there they die </s>
<s> 
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced
to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island </s>
<s> 

in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size
ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window </s>
<s> 
of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
describedthere were assembled three men who regarding each other
every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation
sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence </s>
<s>   one of these was
toby crackit another <abvr> chitling and the third a robber of fifty
years whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and
whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the
same occasion </s>
<s>   this man was a returned transport and his name was
kags </s>
<s> 

i wish said toby turning to <abvr> chitling that you had picked out
some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come
here my fine feller </s>
<s> 

why didnt you blunderhead </s>
<s>  said kags </s>
<s> 

well i thought youd have been a little more glad to see me than
this replied <abvr> chitling with a melancholy air </s>
<s> 

why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so
very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over
his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it its rather a
startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with
at conweniency circumstanced as you are </s>
<s> 

especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping
with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts
and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return
added <abvr> kags </s>
<s> 

there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon
as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devilmaycare
swagger turned to chitling and said

when was fagin took then </s>
<s> 

just at dinnertimetwo oclock this afternoon </s>
<s>   charley and i made
our lucky up the washus chimney and bolter got into the empty
waterbutt head downwards </s>

and bet </s>
<s> 

poor bet </s>
<s>   she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied
chitling his countenance falling more and more and went off mad
screaming and raving and beating her head against the boards </s>
<s>  so they
put a straitweskut on her and took her to the hospitaland there she
is </s>
<s> 

wots come of young bates </s>
<s>  demanded kags </s>
<s> 

he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here
soon replied chitling </s>
<s>   theres nowhere else to go to now for the
people at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the keni
went up there and see it with my own eyesis filled with traps </s>

this is a smash observed toby biting his lips </s>

one will go with this </s>

the sessions are on said kags </s>

bolter turns kings evidence </s>
<s>   as of course he will from what hes
said already </s>
<s>   they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and
get the trial on on friday and hell swing in six days from this by
g </s>
<s> 

you should have heard the people groan said chitling </s>
<s>  the officers
fought like devils or theyd have torn him away </s>
<s>   he was down once
but they made a ring round him and fought their way along </s>
<s>   you should
have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to
them as if they were his dearest friends </s>
<s>   i can see em now not able
to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along
amongst em </s>
<s>  i can see the people jumping up one behind another and
snarling with their teeth and making at him </s>
<s>  i can see the blood upon
his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked
themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore
theyd tear his heart out </s>
<s> 

the horrorstricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his
ears and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro
like one distracted </s>
<s> 

while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their
eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs
and sikess dog bounded into the room </s>
<s>   they ran to the window
downstairs and into the street </s>
<s>   the dog had jumped in at an open
window </s>
<s>  he made no attempt to follow them nor was his master to be
seen </s>
<s> 

whats the meaning of this </s>
<s>  said toby when they had returned </s>
<s>  he
cant be coming here </s>
<s>   iihope not </s>
<s> 

if he was coming here hed have come with the dog said kags
stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor </s>
<s> 
here </s>
<s>   give us some water for him </s>
<s>  he has run himself faint </s>

hes drunk it all up every drop said chitling after watching the
dog some time in silence </s>

have come a long way </s>

where can he have come from </s>
<s>  exclaimed toby </s>
<s>   hes been to the other
kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here
where hes been many a time and often </s>

first and how comes he here alone without the other </s>
<s> 

henone of them called the murderer by his old namehe cant
have made away with himself </s>
<s>   what do you think </s>
<s>  said chitling </s>
<s> 

toby shook his head </s>
<s> 

if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he
did it </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   i think hes got out of the country and left the dog
behind </s>
<s>   he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so
easy </s>
<s> 

this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the
right </s>
<s>  the dog creeping under a chair coiled himself up to sleep
without more notice from anybody </s>
<s> 

it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and
placed upon the table </s>
<s>   the terrible events of the last two days had
made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and
uncertainty of their own position </s>
<s>   they drew their chairs closer
together starting at every sound </s>
<s>   they spoke little and that in
whispers and were as silent and awestricken as if the remains of the
murdered woman lay in the next room </s>
<s> 

they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below </s>
<s> 

young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he
felt himself </s>
<s> 

the knocking came again </s>
<s>   no it wasnt he </s>
<s>   he never knocked like that </s>
<s> 

crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head </s>
<s> 
there was no need to tell them who it was </s>
<s>  his pale face was enough </s>
<s> 
the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the door </s>
<s> 

we must let him in he said taking up the candle </s>
<s> 

isnt there any help for it </s>
<s>  asked the other man in a hoarse voice </s>
<s> 

none </s>
<s>   he must come in </s>
<s> 

dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the
chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he had finished </s>
<s> 

crackit went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the
lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief and another tied over
his head under his hat </s>
<s>   he drew them slowly off </s>
<s>   blanched face
sunken eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh
short thick breath </s>
<s>  it was the very ghost of sikes </s>
<s> 

he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room
but shuddering as he was about to drop into it and seeming to glance
over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it
would goand ground it against itand sat down </s>
<s> 

not a word had been exchanged </s>
<s>   he looked from one to another in
silence </s>
<s>   if an eye were furtively raised and met his it was instantly
averted </s>
<s>   when his hollow voice broke silence they all three started </s>
<s> 
they seemed never to have heard its tones before </s>
<s> 

how came that dog here </s>
<s>  he asked </s>
<s> 

alone </s>
<s>   three hours ago </s>
<s> 

tonights paper says that fagins took </s>
<s>   is it true or a lie </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s> 

they were silent again </s>
<s> 

damn you all </s>
<s>  said sikes passing his hand across his forehead </s>
<s> 

have you nothing to say to me </s>
<s> 

there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke </s>
<s> 

you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit
do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over </s>
<s> 

you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person
addressed after some hesitation </s>
<s> 

sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him </s>
<s>   rather trying to
turn his head than actually doing it </s>
<s>   and said isitthe bodyis
it buried </s>
<s> 

they shook their heads </s>
<s> 

why isnt it </s>
<s>  he retorted with the same glance behind him </s>
<s>  wot do
they keep such ugly things above the ground for </s>
<s> whos that knocking </s>
<s> 

crackit intimated by a motion of his hand as he left the room that
there was nothing to fear </s>
<s>  and directly came back with charley bates
behind him </s>
<s>   sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy
entered the room he encountered his figure </s>
<s> 

toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards
him why didnt you tell me this downstairs </s>
<s> 

there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the
three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad </s>
<s> 
accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with him </s>
<s> 

let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still
farther </s>
<s> 

charley </s>
<s>  said sikes stepping forward </s>
<s>   dont youdont you know
me </s>
<s> 

dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and
looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face </s>
<s>   you
monster </s>
<s> 

the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other </s>
<s>  but sikess
eyes sunk gradually to the ground </s>
<s> 

witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and
becoming more and more excited as he spoke </s>
<s>  witness you threeim not
afraid of himif they come here after him ill give him up </s>
<s>  i will </s>
<s> 
i tell you out at once </s>

<s>  help </s>
<s>   if theres the pluck of a man among
you three youll help me </s>
<s>   murder </s>
<s>   help </s>
<s>   down with him </s>
<s> 

pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent
gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the
strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of
his surprise brought him heavily to the ground </s>
<s> 

the three spectators seemed quite stupefied </s>
<s>   they offered no
interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together </s>
<s>  the
former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his
hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast
and never ceasing to call for help with all his might </s>
<s> 

the contest however was too unequal to last long </s>
<s>   sikes had him
down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with
a look of alarm and pointed to the window </s>
<s>   there were lights gleaming
below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried
footstepsendless they seemed in numbercrossing the nearest wooden
bridge </s>
<s>   one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd </s>
<s>  for there
was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement </s>
<s>   the gleam of
lights increased </s>
<s>  the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on </s>
<s> 
then came a loud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from
such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail </s>
<s> 

help </s>
<s>  shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air </s>
<s> 

hes here </s>
<s>   break down the door </s>

in the kings name cried the voices without </s>

arose again but louder </s>

open it </s>
<s>   run straight to the room where the light is </s>
<s>  break down the
door </s>
<s> 

strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower
windowshutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the
crowd </s>
<s>  giving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of
its immense extent </s>
<s> 

open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching
hellbabe cried sikes fiercely </s>
<s>  running to and fro and dragging the
boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack </s>
<s>  that door </s>

he flung him in bolted it and turned the key </s>

door fast </s>

doublelocked and chained replied crackit who with the other two
men still remained quite helpless and bewildered </s>

lined with sheetiron </s>

and the windows too </s>

yes and the windows </s>
<s> 

damn you </s>
<s>  cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd </s>
<s>   do your worst </s>
<s>   ill cheat you yet </s>
<s> 

of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could
exceed the cry of the infuriated throng </s>
<s>   some shouted to those who
were nearest to set the house on fire </s>
<s>  others roared to the officers to
shoot him dead </s>
<s>   among them all none showed such fury as the man on
horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting
through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the
window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the
man who brings a ladder </s>
<s> 

the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it </s>
<s>   some
called for ladders some for sledgehammers </s>
<s>  some ran with torches to
and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again </s>
<s>  some
spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations </s>
<s>  some pressed
forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of
those below </s>
<s>  some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the
waterspout and crevices in the wall </s>
<s>  and all waved to and fro in the
darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind </s>
<s>   and
joined from time to time in one loud furious roar </s>
<s> 

the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the room and
shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up </s>
<s>  give me a rope a
long rope </s>
<s>   theyre all in front </s>
<s>   i may drop into the folly ditch and
clear off that way </s>
<s>   give me a rope or i shall do three more murders
and kill myself </s>
<s> 

the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept </s>
<s>  the
murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up
to the housetop </s>
<s> 

all the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up
except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that
was too small even for the passage of his body </s>
<s>   but from this
aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the
back </s>
<s>  and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by
the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in
an unbroken stream </s>
<s> 

he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose
so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
to open it from the inside </s>
<s>  and creeping over the tiles looked over
the low parapet </s>
<s> 

the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud </s>
<s> 

the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his
motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it
and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
which all their previous shouting had been whispers </s>
<s>   again and again
it rose </s>
<s>   those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning
took up the sound </s>
<s>  it echoed and reechoed </s>

to every housetop </s>

there was another roar </s>

turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth </s>

dreadful </s>
<s>  the narrow ways were completely blocked up </s>
<s>  and at this time

the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the

the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
crowd and the impossibility of escape </s>

ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in

roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within

set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the
rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong
running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second </s>

slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman
beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly
warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat

his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror </s>

a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney

the events narrated in the last </s>
<s> were yet but two days old when
oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a
travellingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town </s>
<s>   <abvr> maylie
and rose and <abvr> bedwin and the good doctor were with him </s>
<s>   and <abvr>
brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned </s>
<s> 

they had not talked much upon the way </s>
<s>  for oliver was in a flutter of
agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less
effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree </s>
<s> 
he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by <abvr>
brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
monks </s>
<s>  and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense </s>
<s> 

the same kind friend had with <abvr> losbernes assistance cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place </s>
<s> 
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long
but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be
at a worse </s>
<s>   so they travelled on in silence </s>
<s>   each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together </s>
<s>   and no one
disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all </s>
<s> 

but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they
journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the
whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a
crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into
that which he had traversed on foot </s>
<s>   a poor houseless wandering boy
without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head </s>
<s> 

see there there </s>
<s>  cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose
and pointing out at the carriage window </s>
<s>  thats the stile i came over </s>
<s> 
there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake
me and force me back </s>
<s>   yonder is the path across the fields leading to
the old house where i was a little child </s>
<s>   oh dick dick my dear old
friend if i could only see you now </s>
<s> 

you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands
between her own </s>
<s>   you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich
you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great
as the coming back to make him happy too </s>
<s> 

yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and
have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place
where he may grow strong and wellshall we </s>
<s> 

rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak </s>
<s> 

you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said
oliver </s>
<s>   it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell </s>
<s>  but
never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile
againi know that tooto think how changed he is </s>
<s>  you did the same
with me </s>
<s>   he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy
with a burst of affectionate emotion </s>
<s>  and i will say god bless you
now and show him how i love him for it </s>
<s> 

as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow
streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
within reasonable bounds </s>
<s>   there was sowerberrys the undertakers just
as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
remembered itthere were all the wellknown shops and houses with
almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedthere
was gamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old
publichouse doorthere was the workhouse the dreary prison of his
youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthere
was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver
involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so
foolish then cried then laughed againthere were scores of faces at
the doors and windows that he knew quite wellthere was nearly
everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life
had been but a happy dream </s>
<s> 

but it was pure earnest joyful reality </s>
<s>   they drove straight to the
door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe
and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
and size </s>
<s>  and here was <abvr> grimwig all ready to receive them kissing
the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as
if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness
and not offering to eat his headno not once </s>
<s>  not even when he
contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and
maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and
that time fast asleep </s>
<s>   there was dinner prepared and there were
bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first halfhour was
over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their
journey down </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained
in a separate room </s>
<s>   the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with
anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present
conversed apart </s>
<s>   once <abvr> maylie was called away and after being
absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping </s>
<s> 
all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets
nervous and uncomfortable </s>
<s>   they sat wondering in silence </s>
<s>  or if they
exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to
hear the sound of their own voices </s>
<s> 

at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they
were to hear no more that night <abvr> losberne and <abvr> grimwig entered
the room followed by <abvr> brownlow and a man whom oliver almost
shrieked with surprise to see </s>
<s>  for they told him it was his brother
and it was the same man he had met at the markettown and seen looking
in with fagin at the window of his little room </s>
<s>   monks cast a look of
hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy
and sat down near the door </s>
<s>   <abvr> brownlow who had papers in his hand
walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated </s>
<s> 

this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have
been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance
repeated here </s>
<s>   i would have spared you the degradation but we must
hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why </s>
<s> 

go on said the person addressed turning away his face </s>
<s>  quick </s>
<s>   i
have almost done enough i think </s>
<s>   dont keep me here </s>

yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy </s>

slumbered on till next day when he died </s>

desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed
to yourself </s>

<s>  and enclosed in a
few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package
that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead </s>

papers was a letter to this girl agnes </s>

what of the letter </s>

the letter </s>

trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what
none could ever give her back </s>
<s>   she was at that time within a few
months of her confinement </s>

her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse
his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on
her or their young child </s>
<s>  for all the guilt was his </s>
<s>   he reminded her
of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her
christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he
hoped one day to have bestowed upon herprayed her yet to keep it and
wear it next her heart as she had done beforeand then ran on
wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone

the will said <abvr> brownlow as olivers tears fell fast </s>
<s> 

monks was silent </s>
<s> 

the will said <abvr> brownlow speaking for him was in the same
spirit as the letter </s>
<s>   he talked of miseries which his wife had brought
upon him </s>
<s>  of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature
bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him </s>
<s>  and
left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds </s>
<s> 
the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for
agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born
alive and ever come of age </s>
<s>   if it were a girl it was to inherit the
money unconditionally </s>
<s>  but if a boy only on the stipulation that in
his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act

mark his confidence in the other and his convictiononly strengthened
by approaching deaththat the child would share her gentle heart and
noble nature </s>

money was to come to you </s>
<s>   for then and not till then when both
children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his
purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed
him with coldness and aversion </s>
<s> 

my mother said monks in a louder tone did what a woman should
have done </s>

there was a short silence here until <abvr> brownlow took up the thread

deathbed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her
unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involvedthough she

would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child
too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been
born and was alive </s>

hunt it down </s>
<s>  never to let it rest </s>
<s>  to pursue it with the bitterest and
most unrelenting animosity </s>

as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on
himself in the impotence of baffled malice <abvr> brownlow turned to the
terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been

ensnared </s>

being rescued </s>

chapter lii

fagins last night alive

the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces </s>
<s>  inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space </s>
<s>  from the rail before
the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries all looks were fixed upon one manfagin </s>
<s>   before him and
behind </s>
<s>   above below on the right and on the left </s>
<s>   he seemed to
stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes </s>
<s> 

he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand
resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and
his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater
distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was
delivering his charge to the jury </s>
<s>   at times he turned his eyes
sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight
in his favour </s>
<s>  and when the points against him were stated with
terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that
he would even then urge something in his behalf </s>
<s>   beyond these
manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot </s>
<s>   he had
scarcely moved since the trial began </s>
<s>  and now that the judge ceased to
speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close
attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still </s>
<s> 

a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself </s>
<s>   looking round
he saw that the juryman had turned together to consider their verdict </s>
<s> 
as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising
above each other to see his face </s>
<s>   some hastily applying their glasses
to their eyes </s>
<s>   and others whispering their neighbours with looks
expressive of abhorrence </s>
<s>   a few there were who seemed unmindful of
him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could
delay </s>
<s>   but in no one facenot even among the women of whom there
were many therecould he read the faintest sympathy with himself or
any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be
condemned </s>
<s> 

as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness
came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards
the judge </s>
<s>   hush </s>
<s> 

they only sought permission to retire </s>
<s> 

he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed
out as though to see which way the greater number leant </s>
<s>  but that was
fruitless </s>
<s>   the jailer touched him on the shoulder </s>
<s>  he followed
mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair </s>
<s>   the man
pointed it out or he would not have seen it </s>
<s> 

he looked up into the gallery again </s>
<s>   some of the people were eating
and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs </s>
<s>  for the crowded place
was very hot </s>
<s>   there was one young man sketching his face in a little
notebook </s>
<s>   he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the
artist broke his pencilpoint and made another with his knife as any
idle spectator might have done </s>
<s> 

in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind
began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost
and how he put it on </s>
<s>   there was an old fat gentleman on the bench
too who had gone out some half an hour before and now come back </s>
<s>   he
wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner
what he had had and where he had had it </s>
<s>  and pursued this train of
careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused
another </s>
<s> 

not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one
oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet </s>
<s>  it
was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could
not fix his thoughts upon it </s>
<s>   thus even while he trembled and turned
burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron
spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken
off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was </s>
<s>   then he
thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffoldand stopped
to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool itand then went on to
think again </s>
<s> 

at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all
towards the door </s>
<s>   the jury returned and passed him close </s>
<s>  he could
glean nothing from their faces </s>
<s>  they might as well have been of stone </s>
<s> 
perfect stillness ensuednot a rustlenot a breathguilty </s>
<s> 

the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another
and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled
out like angry thunder </s>
<s>   it was a peal of joy from the populace
outside greeting the news that he would die on monday </s>
<s> 

the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him </s>
<s>  he had resumed his
listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the
demand was made </s>
<s>  but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it
and then he only muttered that he was an old manan old manand so
dropping into a whisper was silent again </s>
<s> 

the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the
same air and gesture </s>
<s>   a woman in the gallery uttered some
exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity </s>
<s>  he looked hastily up
as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively </s>
<s> 
the address was solemn and impressive </s>
<s>  the sentence fearful to hear </s>
<s> 
but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve </s>
<s>   his
haggard face was still thrust forward his underjaw hanging down and
his eyes staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his
arm and beckoned him away </s>
<s>   he gazed stupidly about him for an
instant and obeyed </s>
<s> 

they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners
were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their
friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard </s>
<s> 
there was nobody there to speak to him </s>
<s>  but as he passed the
prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were
clinging to the bars </s>
<s>   and they assailed him with opprobrious names
and screeched and hissed </s>
<s>   he shook his fist and would have spat upon
them </s>
<s>  but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage
lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison </s>
<s> 

here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of
anticipating the law </s>
<s>  this ceremony performed they led him to one of
the condemned cells and left him therealone </s>
<s> 

he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat
and bedstead </s>
<s>  and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to
collect his thoughts </s>
<s>  after awhile he began to remember a few
disjointed fragments of what the judge had said </s>
<s>  though it had seemed
to him at the time that he could not hear a word </s>
<s>   these gradually
fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more </s>
<s>   so that
in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered </s>
<s>   to be
hanged by the neck till he was deadthat was the end </s>
<s>   to be hanged
by the neck till he was dead </s>
<s> 

as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known
who had died upon the scaffold </s>
<s>  some of them through his means </s>
<s>   they
rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them </s>
<s>   he
had seen some of them dieand had joked too because they died with
prayers upon their lips </s>
<s>   with what a rattling noise the drop went
down </s>
<s>  and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to
dangling heaps of clothes </s>
<s> 

some of them might have inhabited that very cellsat upon that very
spot </s>
<s>   it was very dark </s>
<s>  why didnt they bring a light </s>
<s>   the cell had
been built for many years </s>
<s>   scores of men must have passed their last
hours there </s>
<s>   it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead
bodiesthe cap the noose the pinioned arms the faces that he knew
even beneath that hideous veil </s>
<s> light light </s>
<s> 

at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door
and walls two men appeared </s>
<s>   one bearing a candle which he thrust
into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall </s>
<s>   the other dragging in
a mattress on which to pass the night </s>
<s>  for the prisoner was to be left
alone no more </s>
<s> 

then came the nightdark dismal silent night </s>
<s>   other watchers are
glad to hear this churchclock strike for they tell of life and coming
day </s>
<s>   to him they brought despair </s>
<s>   the boom of every iron bell came
laden with the one deep hollow sounddeath </s>
<s>  what availed the noise
and bustle of cheerful morning which penetrated even there to him </s>
<s> 
it was another form of knell with mockery added to the warning </s>
<s> 

the day passed off </s>
<s>   day </s>
<s>   there was no day </s>
<s>  it was gone as soon as
comeand night came on again </s>
<s>  night so long and yet so short </s>
<s>  long in
its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours </s>
<s>   at one time he
raved and blasphemed </s>
<s>  and at another howled and tore his hair </s>
<s> 
venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he
had driven them away with curses </s>
<s>   they renewed their charitable
efforts and he beat them off </s>
<s> 

saturday night </s>
<s>   he had only one night more to live </s>
<s>   and as he thought
of this the day brokesunday </s>
<s> 

it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering
sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon
his blighted soul </s>
<s>  not that he had ever held any defined or positive
hope of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than
the dim probability of dying so soon </s>
<s>  he had spoken little to either of
the two men who relieved each other in their attendance upon him </s>
<s>  and
they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention </s>
<s>   he had
sat there awake but dreaming </s>
<s>   now he started up every minute and
with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even theyused to such
sightsrecoiled from him with horror </s>
<s>   he grew so terrible at last
in all the tortures of his evil conscience that one man could not bear
to sit there eyeing him alone </s>
<s>  and so the two kept watch together </s>
<s> 

he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the past </s>
<s>  he had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth </s>
<s>   his red hair
hung down upon his bloodless face </s>
<s>  his beard was torn and twisted into
knots </s>
<s>  his eyes shone with a terrible light </s>
<s>  his unwashed flesh
crackled with the fever that burnt him up </s>
<s>  eightninethen </s>
<s>   if it
was not a trick to frighten him and those were the real hours treading
on each others heels where would he be when they came round again </s>
<s> 
eleven </s>
<s>   another struck before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate </s>
<s>   at eight he would be the only mourner in his own
funeral train </s>
<s>  at eleven

those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and
such unspeakable anguish not only from the eyes but too often and
too long from the thoughts of men never held so dread a spectacle as
that </s>
<s>   the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the man
was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow would have slept but ill that
night if they could have seen him </s>
<s> 

from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two
and three presented themselves at the lodgegate and inquired with
anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received </s>
<s>   these being
answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to
clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from
which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built
and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the
scene </s>
<s>   by degrees they fell off one by one </s>
<s>  and for an hour in the
dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness </s>
<s> 

the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers
painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd when <abvr> brownlow and oliver appeared
at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner
signed by one of the sheriffs </s>
<s>   they were immediately admitted into the
lodge </s>
<s> 

is the young gentleman to come too sir </s>
<s>  said the man whose duty it
was to conduct them </s>
<s>   its not a sight for children sir </s>
<s> 

it is not indeed my friend rejoined <abvr> brownlow </s>
<s>  but my business
with this man is intimately connected with him </s>
<s>  and as this child has
seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as
welleven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him
now </s>
<s> 

these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver </s>
<s> 
the man touched his hat </s>
<s>  and glancing at oliver with some curiousity
opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and
led them on through dark and winding ways towards the cells </s>
<s> 

this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
workmen were making some preparations in profound silencethis is the
place he passes through </s>
<s>   if you step this way you can see the door he
goes out at </s>
<s> 

he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the
prison food and pointed to a door </s>
<s>   there was an open grating above
it through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the
noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards </s>
<s>   they were
putting up the scaffold </s>
<s> 

from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by
other turnkeys from the inner side </s>
<s>  and having entered an open yard
ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row
of strong doors on the left hand </s>
<s>   motioning them to remain where they
were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys </s>
<s>  the
two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage
stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned
the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell </s>
<s>   they did so </s>
<s> 

the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side
to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
face of a man </s>
<s>   his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for
he continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence
otherwise than as a part of his vision </s>

the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned </s>

faster </s>
<s> 

the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp
held him back </s>
<s>   he struggled with the power of desperation for an
instant </s>
<s>  and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those
massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard </s>
<s> 

it was some time before they left the prison </s>
<s>   oliver nearly swooned
after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an hour or more
he had not the strength to walk </s>

day was dawning when they again emerged </s>

chapter liii

and last

the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed </s>
<s> 
the little that remains to their historian to relate is told in few
and simple words </s>
<s> 

before three months had passed rose fleming and harry maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergymans labours </s>
<s>  on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home </s>

wellspent life have been unceasingly bestowed </s>
<s> 

it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered
either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided
between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than
three thousand pounds </s>
<s>   by the provisions of his fathers will oliver
would have been entitled to the whole </s>
<s>  but <abvr> brownlow unwilling to
deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices

which his young charge joyfully acceded </s>
<s> 

monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a
distant part of the new world </s>
<s>  where having quickly squandered it he
once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk
under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison </s>
<s>   as far from

<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  brownlow adopted oliver as his son </s>
<s>   removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonagehouse where his dear
friends resided he gratified the only remaining wish of olivers warm
and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world </s>
<s> 

soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned
to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would
have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a
feeling </s>
<s>  and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how </s>
<s>   for
two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared
the air began to disagree with him </s>
<s>  then finding that the place really
no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his
assistant took a bachelors cottage outside the village of which his
young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered </s>
<s>   here he took
to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other
pursuits of a similar kind </s>
<s>   all undertaken with his characteristic
impetuosity </s>
<s>   in each and all he has since become famous throughout the
neighborhood as a most profound authority </s>
<s> 

before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for
mr </s>
<s>  grimwig which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated </s>
<s>   he
is accordingly visited by <abvr> grimwig a great many times in the course
of the year </s>
<s>   on all such occasions <abvr> grimwig plants fishes and
carpenters with great ardour </s>
<s>  doing everything in a very singular and
unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite
asseveration that his mode is the right one </s>
<s>   on sundays he never
fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergymans face </s>
<s>   always
informing <abvr> losberne in strict confidence afterwards that he
considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say
so </s>
<s>   it is a standing and very favourite joke for <abvr> brownlow to
rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of
the night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his
return </s>
<s>  but <abvr> grimwig contends that he was right in the main and in
proof thereof remarks that oliver did not come back after all </s>
