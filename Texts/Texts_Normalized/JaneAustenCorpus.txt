<s> the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex </s>
<s>   their estate
was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of
their property where for many generations they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance </s>
<s>   the late owner of this estate was a single
man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his
life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister </s>
<s>   but her
death which happened ten years before his own produced a great
alteration in his home </s>
<s>  for to supply her loss he invited and received
into his house the family of his nephew <abvr> henry dashwood the legal
inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to
bequeath it </s>
<s>   in the society of his nephew and niece and their
children the old gentlemans days were comfortably spent </s>
<s>   his
attachment to them all increased </s>
<s>   the constant attention of <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from
interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive </s>
<s>  and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his existence </s>
<s> 

by a former marriage <abvr> henry dashwood had one son </s>
<s>  by his present
lady three daughters </s>
<s>   the son a steady respectable young man was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age </s>
<s>   by his own
marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his
wealth </s>
<s>   to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters </s>
<s>  for their fortune independent
of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that
property could be but small </s>
<s>   their mother had nothing and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal </s>
<s>  for the
remaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was also secured to her
child and he had only a lifeinterest in it </s>
<s> 

the old gentleman died </s>
<s>  his will was read and like almost every other
will gave as much disappointment as pleasure </s>
<s>   he was neither so
unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew </s>
<s> but
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his son </s>
<s> but to his son and his
sons son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or
by any sale of its valuable woods </s>
<s>   the whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and
mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old </s>
<s>  an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his
own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which for years he had received
from his niece and her daughters </s>
<s>   he meant not to be unkind however
and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a
thousand pounds apiece </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwoods disappointment was at first severe </s>
<s>  but his temper was
cheerful and sanguine </s>
<s>  and he might reasonably hope to live many years
and by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate
improvement </s>
<s>   but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was
his only one twelvemonth </s>
<s>   he survived his uncle no longer </s>
<s>  and ten
thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for
his widow and daughters </s>
<s> 

his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him <abvr>
dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command the interest of his motherinlaw and sisters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family </s>
<s>  but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable </s>
<s>   his father was rendered easy by such an assurance
and <abvr> john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his power to do for them </s>
<s> 

he was not an illdisposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be illdisposed </s>
<s>  but he was in general well
respected </s>
<s>  for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties </s>
<s>   had he married a more amiable woman he might
have been made still more respectable than he was </s>
<s> he might even have
been made amiable himself </s>
<s>  for he was very young when he married and
very fond of his wife </s>
<s>   but <abvr> john dashwood was a strong caricature
of himself </s>
<s> more narrowminded and selfish </s>
<s> 

when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds apiece </s>
<s>   he then really thought himself equal to it </s>
<s>   the
prospect of four thousand ayear in addition to his present income
besides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune warmed his
heart and made him feel capable of generosity </s>
<s>  yes he would give
them three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  it would be liberal and handsome </s>
<s>  it would
be enough to make them completely easy </s>
<s>   three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  he
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience </s>
<s>  he
thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did
not repent </s>
<s> 

no sooner was his fathers funeral over than <abvr> john dashwood
without sending any notice of her intention to her motherinlaw
arrived with her child and their attendants </s>
<s>   no one could dispute her
right to come </s>
<s>  the house was her husbands from the moment of his
fathers decease </s>
<s>  but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater and to a woman in <abvr> dashwoods situation with only common
feelings must have been highly unpleasing </s>
<s> but in her mind there was
a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of
the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of
immovable disgust </s>
<s>   <abvr> john dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her husbands family </s>
<s>  but she had had no opportunity till the
present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she could act when occasion required it </s>
<s> 

so acutely did <abvr> dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so
earnestly did she despise her daughterinlaw for it that on the
arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children
determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother </s>
<s> 

elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed
a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified
her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and
enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all
that eagerness of mind in <abvr> dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence </s>
<s>   she had an excellent heart </s>
<s> her disposition was
affectionate and her feelings were strong </s>
<s>  but she knew how to govern
them </s>
<s>  it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn </s>
<s>  and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught </s>
<s> 

mariannes abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinors </s>
<s> 
she was sensible and clever </s>
<s>  but eager in everything </s>
<s>  her sorrows her
joys could have no moderation </s>
<s>   she was generous amiable
interesting </s>
<s>  she was everything but prudent </s>
<s>   the resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great </s>
<s> 

elinor saw with concern the excess of her sisters sensibility </s>
<s>  but
by <abvr> dashwood it was valued and cherished </s>
<s>   they encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction </s>
<s>   the agony of grief
which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought
for was created again and again </s>
<s>   they gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future </s>
<s>   elinor too was deeply afflicted </s>
<s>  but still she could
struggle she could exert herself </s>
<s>   she could consult with her brother
could receive her sisterinlaw on her arrival and treat her with
proper attention </s>
<s>  and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance </s>
<s> 

margaret the other sister was a goodhumored welldisposed girl </s>
<s>  but
as she had already imbibed a good deal of mariannes romance without
having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal
her sisters at a more advanced period of life </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland </s>
<s>  and her
mother and sistersinlaw were degraded to the condition of visitors </s>
<s> 
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility </s>
<s>  and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself his wife and their child </s>
<s>   he really pressed them
with some earnestness to consider norland as their home </s>
<s>  and as no
plan appeared so eligible to <abvr> dashwood as remaining there till she
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his
invitation was accepted </s>
<s> 

a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight was exactly what suited her mind </s>
<s>   in seasons of cheerfulness
no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater
degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself </s>
<s>   but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters </s>
<s>   to take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree </s>
<s>   she begged him to think again on the subject </s>
<s>   how
could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too
of so large a sum </s>
<s>   and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods
who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no
relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount </s>
<s>   it
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages </s>
<s>  and why was he
to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his
money to his half sisters </s>
<s> 

it was my fathers last request to me replied her husband that i
should assist his widow and daughters </s>
<s> 

he did not know what he was talking of i dare say </s>
<s>  ten to one but he
was lightheaded at the time </s>
<s>   had he been in his right senses he
could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
your fortune from your own child </s>
<s> 

he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny </s>
<s>  he only
requested me in general terms to assist them and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do </s>
<s>   perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself </s>
<s>   he could
hardly suppose i should neglect them </s>
<s>   but as he required the promise
i could not do less than give it </s>
<s>  at least i thought so at the time </s>
<s> 
the promise therefore was given and must be performed </s>
<s>   something
must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new
home </s>
<s> 

well then let something be done for them </s>
<s>  but that something need
not be three thousand pounds </s>
<s>   consider she added that when the
money is once parted with it never can return </s>
<s>   your sisters will
marry and it will be gone for ever </s>
<s>   if indeed it could be restored
to our poor little boy

why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make
great difference </s>
<s>   the time may come when harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with </s>
<s>   if he should have a numerous family for
instance it would be a very convenient addition </s>
<s> 

to be sure it would </s>
<s> 

perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were
diminished one half </s>
<s> five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  beyond anything great </s>
<s>   what brother on earth would do half so
much for his sisters even if really his sisters </s>
<s>   and as it isonly
half blood </s>
<s> but you have such a generous spirit </s>
<s> 

i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied </s>
<s>   one had rather
on such occasions do too much than too little </s>
<s>   no one at least can
think i have not done enough for them </s>
<s>  even themselves they can hardly
expect more </s>
<s> 

there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are
not to think of their expectations </s>
<s>  the question is what you can
afford to do </s>
<s> 

certainlyand i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds
apiece </s>
<s>   as it is without any addition of mine they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mothers deatha very comfortable
fortune for any young woman </s>
<s> 

to be sure it is </s>
<s>  and indeed it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all </s>
<s>   they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them </s>
<s>   if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do
not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the
whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives rather than for themsomething of the annuity kind i
mean </s>
<s> my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself </s>
<s> 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable </s>
<s> 

his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this
plan </s>
<s> 

to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once </s>
<s>   but then if <abvr> dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in </s>
<s> 

fifteen years </s>
<s>  my dear fanny </s>
<s>  her life cannot be worth half that
purchase </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s>  but if you observe people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them </s>
<s>  and she is very stout and healthy
and hardly forty </s>
<s>   an annuity is a very serious business </s>
<s>  it comes over
and over every year and there is no getting rid of it </s>
<s>   you are not
aware of what you are doing </s>
<s>   i have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities </s>
<s>  for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my fathers will and it is amazing how
disagreeable she found it </s>
<s>   twice every year these annuities were to be
paid </s>
<s>  and then there was the trouble of getting it to them </s>
<s>  and then
one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing </s>
<s>   my mother was quite sick of it </s>
<s>   her income was not her
own she said with such perpetual claims on it </s>
<s>  and it was the more
unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been
entirely at my mothers disposal without any restriction whatever </s>
<s>   it
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world </s>
<s> 

it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied <abvr> dashwood to have
those kind of yearly drains on ones income </s>
<s>   ones fortune as your
mother justly says is not ones own </s>
<s>   to be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable </s>
<s>  it
takes away ones independence </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  and after all you have no thanks for it </s>
<s>   they think
themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises
no gratitude at all </s>
<s>   if i were you whatever i did should be done at
my own discretion entirely </s>
<s>   i would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly </s>
<s>   it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses </s>
<s> 

i believe you are right my love </s>
<s>  it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case </s>
<s>  whatever i may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year </s>
<s>   it will certainly be much the best way </s>
<s>   a present of fifty
pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for
money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father </s>
<s> 

to be sure it will </s>
<s>   indeed to say the truth i am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all </s>
<s>   the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you </s>
<s>  for instance such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things
and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they
are in season </s>
<s>   ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther </s>
<s>  indeed
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did </s>
<s>   do but consider
my dear <abvr> dashwood how excessively comfortable your motherinlaw
and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which
brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they will
pay their mother for their board out of it </s>
<s>   altogether they will have
five hundred ayear amongst them and what on earth can four women want
for more than that </s>
<s> they will live so cheap </s>
<s>  their housekeeping will
be nothing at all </s>
<s>   they will have no carriage no horses and hardly
any servants </s>
<s>  they will keep no company and can have no expenses of
any kind </s>
<s>   only conceive how comfortable they will be </s>
<s>   five hundred a
year </s>
<s>  i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it </s>
<s>  and as
to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it </s>
<s>   they will
be much more able to give you something </s>
<s> 

upon my word said <abvr> dashwood i believe you are perfectly right </s>
<s> 
my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say </s>
<s>   i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described </s>
<s>   when my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can </s>
<s>   some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then </s>
<s> 

certainly returned <abvr> john dashwood </s>
<s>   but however one thing
must be considered </s>
<s>   when your father and mother moved to norland
though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and
linen was saved and is now left to your mother </s>
<s>   her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it </s>
<s> 

that is a material consideration undoubtedly </s>
<s>   a valuable legacy
indeed </s>
<s>  and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house </s>
<s>   a great deal too handsome in my opinion for
any place they can ever afford to live in </s>
<s>   but however so it is </s>
<s> 
your father thought only of them </s>
<s>   and i must say this </s>
<s>  that you owe no
particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes </s>
<s>  for we very
well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the
world to them </s>
<s> 

this argument was irresistible </s>
<s>   it gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before </s>
<s>  and he finally resolved that it would be
absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the
widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his own wife pointed out </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood remained at norland several months </s>
<s>  not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while </s>
<s>  for when
her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland </s>
<s>  for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible </s>
<s>   but she could
hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which
her mother would have approved </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections </s>
<s>   she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her
daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than l would support her in
affluence </s>
<s>   for their brothers sake too for the sake of his own
heart she rejoiced </s>
<s>  and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
merit before in believing him incapable of generosity </s>
<s>   his attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
was dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on the
liberality of his intentions </s>
<s> 

the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for
her daughterinlaw was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character which half a years residence in her family afforded </s>
<s> 
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to
the opinions of <abvr> dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland </s>
<s> 

this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of <abvr> john dashwood a gentlemanlike and pleasing young
man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters
establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there </s>
<s> 

some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich </s>
<s>  and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence
for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother </s>
<s>   but <abvr> dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration </s>
<s>   it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable
that he loved her daughter and that elinor returned the partiality </s>
<s> 
it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition </s>
<s>  and that elinors merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible </s>
<s> 

edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address </s>
<s>   he was not handsome and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing </s>
<s>   he was too diffident
to do justice to himself </s>
<s>  but when his natural shyness was overcome
his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart </s>
<s> 
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid
improvement </s>
<s>   but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him
distinguishedasthey hardly knew what </s>
<s>   they wanted him to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other </s>
<s>   his mother wished to
interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day </s>
<s>   <abvr> john
dashwood wished it likewise </s>
<s>  but in the mean while till one of these
superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche </s>
<s>   but edward had no turn for
great men or barouches </s>
<s>   all his wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life </s>
<s>   fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising </s>
<s> 

edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of <abvr> dashwoods attention </s>
<s>  for she was at that time in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects </s>
<s>   she saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it </s>
<s>   he
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by illtimed conversation </s>
<s> 
she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a
reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him and his sister </s>
<s>   it was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother </s>
<s> 

it is enough said she </s>
<s>  to say that he is unlike fanny is enough </s>
<s> 
it implies everything amiable </s>
<s>   i love him already </s>
<s> 

i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him </s>
<s> 

like him </s>
<s>  replied her mother with a smile </s>
<s>   i feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love </s>
<s> 

you may esteem him </s>
<s> 

i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him </s>
<s>   her manners
were attaching and soon banished his reserve </s>
<s>   she speedily
comprehended all his merits </s>
<s>  the persuasion of his regard for elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration </s>
<s>  but she really felt assured of his
worth </s>
<s>  and even that quietness of manner which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young mans address ought to be was no
longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
affectionate </s>
<s> 

no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
elinor than she considered their serious attachment as certain and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching </s>
<s> 

in a few months my dear marianne </s>
<s>  said she elinor will in all
probability be settled for life </s>
<s>   we shall miss her </s>

happy </s>

perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise </s>

striking </s>

<s>   his eyes want all that spirit
that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence </s>
<s>   and besides
all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste </s>
<s>   music seems
scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinors drawings very
much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth </s>
<s>   it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while
she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter </s>
<s>   he admires as
a lover not as a connoisseur </s>
<s>   to satisfy me those characters must be
united </s>
<s>   i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own </s>
<s>   he must enter into all my feelings </s>

<s>  mama how
spiritless how tame was edwards manner in reading to us last night </s>
<s> 
i felt for my sister most severely </s>
<s>   yet she bore it with so much
composure she seemed scarcely to notice it </s>
<s>   i could hardly keep my
seat </s>
<s>   to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such
dreadful indifference </s>
<s> 

he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose </s>
<s> 
i thought so at the time </s>
<s>  but you would give him cowper </s>
<s> 

nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper </s>
<s> but we must allow
for difference of taste </s>
<s>   elinor has not my feelings and therefore she
may overlook it and be happy with him </s>
<s>   but it would have broke my
heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility </s>
<s> 
mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i

chapter 


what a pity it is elinor said marianne that edward should have no
taste for drawing </s>
<s> 

no taste for drawing </s>
<s>  replied elinor why should you think so </s>
<s>  he
does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of
improving it </s>
<s>   had he ever been in the way of learning i think he
would have drawn very well </s>
<s>   he distrusts his own judgment in such
matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any
picture </s>
<s>  but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which
in general direct him perfectly right </s>
<s> 

marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject </s>
<s>  but
the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the
drawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delight
which in her opinion could alone be called taste </s>
<s>   yet though
smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for that
blind partiality to edward which produced it </s>
<s> 

i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him as
deficient in general taste </s>
<s>   indeed i think i may say that you cannot
for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your
opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him </s>
<s> 

marianne hardly knew what to say </s>
<s>   she would not wound the feelings of
her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was
impossible </s>
<s>   at length she replied </s>
<s> 

do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his merits </s>
<s>   i have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his
inclinations and tastes as you have </s>
<s>  but i have the highest opinion in
the world of his goodness and sense </s>
<s>   i think him every thing that is
worthy and amiable </s>
<s> 

i am sure replied elinor with a smile that his dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that </s>
<s>   i do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly </s>
<s> 

marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased </s>
<s> 

of his sense and his goodness continued elinor no one can i
think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in
unreserved conversation </s>
<s>   the excellence of his understanding and his
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him silent </s>
<s>   you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth </s>
<s> 
but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself </s>
<s>   he and i
have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother </s>
<s>   i
have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard
his opinion on subjects of literature and taste </s>
<s>  and upon the whole i
venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed enjoyment of books
exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and
correct and his taste delicate and pure </s>
<s>   his abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person </s>
<s> 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking </s>
<s>  and his person
can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which
are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is
perceived </s>
<s>   at present i know him so well that i think him really
handsome </s>
<s>  or at least almost so </s>
<s>   what say you marianne </s>
<s> 

i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now </s>
<s>   when
you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection
in his face than i now do in his heart </s>
<s> 

elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she
had been betrayed into in speaking of him </s>
<s>   she felt that edward stood
very high in her opinion </s>
<s>   she believed the regard to be mutual </s>
<s>  but
she required greater certainty of it to make mariannes conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her </s>
<s>   she knew that what marianne and her
mother conjectured one moment they believed the nextthat with them
to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect </s>
<s>   she tried to explain
the real state of the case to her sister </s>
<s> 

i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of
himthat i greatly esteem that i like him </s>
<s> 

marianne here burst forth with indignation

esteem him </s>
<s>  like him </s>
<s>  coldhearted elinor </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>   worse than
coldhearted </s>
<s>  ashamed of being otherwise </s>
<s>   use those words again and i
will leave the room this moment </s>
<s> 

elinor could not help laughing </s>
<s>   excuse me said she </s>
<s>  and be assured
that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my
own feelings </s>
<s>   believe them to be stronger than i have declared </s>
<s> 
believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicionthe
hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly </s>
<s> 
but farther than this you must not believe </s>
<s>   i am by no means assured
of his regard for me </s>
<s>   there are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful </s>
<s>  and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by
believing or calling it more than it is </s>
<s>   in my heart i feel
littlescarcely any doubt of his preference </s>
<s>   but there are other
points to be considered besides his inclination </s>
<s>   he is very far from
being independent </s>
<s>   what his mother really is we cannot know </s>
<s>  but from
fannys occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never
been disposed to think her amiable </s>
<s>  and i am very much mistaken if
edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank </s>
<s> 

marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
and herself had outstripped the truth </s>
<s> 

and you really are not engaged to him </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>   yet it certainly
soon will happen </s>
<s>   but two advantages will proceed from this delay </s>
<s>   i
shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  if he should
be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how
delightful it would be </s>
<s> 

elinor had given her real opinion to her sister </s>
<s>   she could not
consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne
had believed it </s>
<s>   there was at times a want of spirits about him
which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as
unpromising </s>
<s>   a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not
give him more than inquietude </s>
<s>   it would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him </s>
<s>   a more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his affection </s>
<s>   she knew that his mother neither behaved
to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him
any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly
attending to her views for his aggrandizement </s>
<s>   with such a knowledge
as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject </s>
<s>   she
was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which
her mother and sister still considered as certain </s>
<s>   nay the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard </s>
<s> 
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more
than friendship </s>
<s> 

but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived
by his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which was
still more common to make her uncivil </s>
<s>   she took the first
opportunity of affronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking to
her so expressively of her brothers great expectations of <abvr>
ferrarss resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in </s>
<s>  that
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to
be calm </s>
<s>   she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and
instantly left the room resolving that whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations </s>
<s> 

in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from the
post which contained a proposal particularly well timed </s>
<s>   it was the
offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of
her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire </s>
<s>   the
letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation </s>
<s>   he understood that she was in need of a
dwelling </s>
<s>  and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage
he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might
think necessary if the situation pleased her </s>
<s>   he earnestly pressed
her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with
her daughters to barton park the place of his own residence from
whence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses
were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable
to her </s>
<s>   he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his cousin </s>
<s>  more especially at a moment when she was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer
connections </s>
<s>   she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry </s>
<s>   her
resolution was formed as she read </s>
<s>   the situation of barton in a
county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours
before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first
recommendation </s>
<s>   to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an
evil </s>
<s>  it was an object of desire </s>
<s>  it was a blessing in comparison of
the misery of continuing her daughterinlaws guest </s>
<s>  and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress </s>
<s>   she instantly wrote sir
john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance
of his proposal </s>
<s>  and then hastened to shew both letters to her
daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her
answer were sent </s>
<s> 

elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance </s>
<s>   on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose
her mothers intention of removing into devonshire </s>
<s>   the house too as
described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so
uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either
point </s>
<s>  and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland
beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence </s>
<s> 



chapter 


no sooner was her answer dispatched than <abvr> dashwood indulged herself
in the pleasure of announcing to her soninlaw and his wife that she
was provided with a house and should incommode them no longer than till
every thing were ready for her inhabiting it </s>
<s>  they heard her with
surprise </s>
<s>  <abvr> john dashwood said nothing </s>
<s>  but her husband civilly hoped
that she would not be settled far from norland </s>
<s>  she had great
satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire </s>
<s> edward
turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise
and concern which required no explanation to her repeated
devonshire </s>
<s>  are you indeed going there </s>
<s>  so far from hence </s>
<s>  and to
what part of it </s>
<s>  she explained the situation </s>
<s>  it was within four miles
northward of exeter </s>
<s> 

it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my
friends in it </s>
<s>   a room or two can easily be added </s>
<s>  and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will
find none in accommodating them </s>
<s> 

she concluded with a very kind invitation to <abvr> and <abvr> john dashwood
to visit her at barton </s>
<s>  and to edward she gave one with still greater
affection </s>
<s>   though her late conversation with her daughterinlaw had
made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was
unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that
point to which it principally tended </s>
<s>   to separate edward and elinor
was as far from being her object as ever </s>
<s>  and she wished to show <abvr>
john dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally
she disregarded her disapprobation of the match </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to
prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture </s>
<s>   he
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion </s>
<s>  for the very
exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable </s>
<s>  the furniture
was all sent around by water </s>
<s>   it chiefly consisted of household linen
plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of mariannes </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh </s>
<s>  she could not
help feeling it hard that as <abvr> dashwoods income would be so
trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome
article of furniture </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  it was ready furnished
and she might have immediate possession </s>
<s>   no difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement </s>
<s>  and she waited only for the disposal of her
effects at norland and to determine her future household before she
set off for the west </s>
<s>  and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her was soon done </s>
<s> the
horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his
death and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage
she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest
daughter </s>
<s>   for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her
own wishes she would have kept it </s>
<s>  but the discretion of elinor
prevailed </s>
<s>   her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three </s>
<s>  two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland </s>
<s> 

the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire
to prepare the house for their mistresss arrival </s>
<s>  for as lady
middleton was entirely unknown to <abvr> dashwood she preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park </s>
<s>  and she
relied so undoubtingly on sir johns description of the house as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own </s>
<s> 
her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her
removal </s>
<s>  a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure </s>
<s>   now was the
time when her soninlaws promise to his father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled </s>
<s>   since he had neglected to do it on first
coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as
the most suitable period for its accomplishment </s>
<s>   but <abvr> dashwood
began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced
from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended
no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland </s>
<s>   he so
frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of
the perpetual demands upon his purse which a man of any consequence in
the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to
stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
money away </s>
<s> 

in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middletons
first letter to norland every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable <abvr> dashwood and her daughters to begin their
journey </s>
<s> 

many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved </s>
<s>   dear dear norland </s>
<s>  said marianne as she wandered
alone before the house on the last evening of their being there </s>
<s>  when
shall i cease to regret you </s>

<s> oh </s>
<s> 
happy house could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this
spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more </s>
<s> and you ye
wellknown trees </s>
<s> but you will continue the same </s>
<s> no leaf will decay

can observe you no longer </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  you will continue the same </s>
<s>  unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shade </s>

enjoy you </s>

chapter 


the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant </s>
<s>   but as they
drew towards the end of it their interest in the appearance of a
country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view
of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness </s>
<s>   it was a
pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich in pasture </s>
<s>   after winding
along it for more than a mile they reached their own house </s>
<s>   a small
green court was the whole of its demesne in front </s>
<s>  and a neat wicket
gate admitted them into it </s>
<s> 

as a house barton cottage though small was comfortable and compact </s>
<s> 
but as a cottage it was defective for the building was regular the
roof was tiled the window shutters were not painted green nor were
the walls covered with honeysuckles </s>
<s>   a narrow passage led directly
through the house into the garden behind </s>
<s>   on each side of the entrance
was a sitting room about sixteen feet square </s>
<s>  and beyond them were the
offices and the stairs </s>
<s>   four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest
of the house </s>
<s>   it had not been built many years and was in good repair </s>
<s> 
in comparison of norland it was poor and small indeed </s>
<s> but the tears
which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon
dried away </s>
<s>   they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their
arrival and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy </s>
<s> 
it was very early in september </s>
<s>  the season was fine and from first
seeing the place under the advantage of good weather they received an
impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending
it to their lasting approbation </s>
<s> 

the situation of the house was good </s>
<s>   high hills rose immediately
behind and at no great distance on each side </s>
<s>  some of which were open
downs the others cultivated and woody </s>
<s>   the village of barton was
chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the
cottage windows </s>
<s>   the prospect in front was more extensive </s>
<s>  it
commanded the whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond </s>
<s> 
the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that
direction </s>
<s>  under another name and in another course it branched out
again between two of the steepest of them </s>
<s> 

with the size and furniture of the house <abvr> dashwood was upon the
whole well satisfied </s>
<s>  for though her former style of life rendered many
additions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was a
delight to her </s>
<s>  and she had at this time ready money enough to supply
all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments </s>
<s>   as for the
house itself to be sure said she it is too small for our family
but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it
is too late in the year for improvements </s>
<s>   perhaps in the spring if i
have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about
building </s>
<s>   these parlors are both too small for such parties of our
friends as i hope to see often collected here </s>
<s>  and i have some thoughts
of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the
other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance </s>
<s>  this
with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bedchamber
and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage </s>
<s>   i could
wish the stairs were handsome </s>
<s>   but one must not expect every thing </s>
<s> 
though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them </s>
<s>   i
shall see how much i am beforehand with the world in the spring and
we will plan our improvements accordingly </s>
<s> 

in the mean time till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred ayear by a woman who never saved
in her life they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
was </s>
<s>  and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns
and endeavoring by placing around them books and other possessions to
form themselves a home </s>
<s>   mariannes pianoforte was unpacked and
properly disposed of </s>
<s>  and elinors drawings were affixed to the walls
of their sitting room </s>
<s> 

in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast
the next day by the entrance of their landlord who called to welcome
them to barton and to offer them every accommodation from his own
house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient </s>
<s>   sir
john middleton was a good looking man about forty </s>
<s>   he had formerly
visited at stanhill but it was too long for his young cousins to
remember him </s>
<s>   his countenance was thoroughly goodhumoured </s>
<s>  and his
manners were as friendly as the style of his letter </s>
<s>   their arrival
seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an
object of real solicitude to him </s>
<s>   he said much of his earnest desire
of their living in the most sociable terms with his family and pressed
them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were
better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a
point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence </s>
<s> 
his kindness was not confined to words </s>
<s>  for within an hour after he
left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from
the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of
game </s>
<s>   he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and
from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of
sending them his newspaper every day </s>
<s> 

lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him denoting her
intention of waiting on <abvr> dashwood as soon as she could be assured
that her visit would be no inconvenience </s>
<s>  and as this message was
answered by an invitation equally polite her ladyship was introduced
to them the next day </s>
<s> 

they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
their comfort at barton must depend </s>
<s>  and the elegance of her appearance
was favourable to their wishes </s>
<s>   lady middleton was not more than six
or seven and twenty </s>
<s>  her face was handsome her figure tall and
striking and her address graceful </s>
<s>   her manners had all the elegance
which her husbands wanted </s>
<s>   but they would have been improved by some
share of his frankness and warmth </s>
<s>  and her visit was long enough to
detract something from their first admiration by shewing that though
perfectly wellbred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say for
herself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark </s>
<s> 

conversation however was not wanted for sir john was very chatty and
lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their
eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means
there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of
extremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beauty
and ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hung
about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her
ladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could
make noise enough at home </s>
<s>   on every formal visit a child ought to be
of the party by way of provision for discourse </s>
<s>   in the present case
it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his
father or mother and in what particular he resembled either for of
course every body differed and every body was astonished at the
opinion of the others </s>
<s> 

an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the
rest of the children as sir john would not leave the house without
securing their promise of dining at the park the next day </s>
<s> 



chapter 


barton park was about half a mile from the cottage </s>
<s>   the ladies had
passed near it in their way along the valley but it was screened from
their view at home by the projection of a hill </s>

and handsome </s>
<s>  and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance </s>
<s>   the former was for sir johns gratification the latter
for that of his lady </s>
<s>   they were scarcely ever without some friends
staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every
kind than any other family in the neighbourhood </s>
<s>   it was necessary to
the happiness of both </s>
<s>  for however dissimilar in temper and outward
behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
talent and taste which confined their employments unconnected with
such as society produced within a very narrow compass </s>
<s>   sir john was a
sportsman lady middleton a mother </s>
<s>   he hunted and shot and she
humoured her children </s>
<s>  and these were their only resources </s>
<s>   lady
middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the
year round while sir johns independent employments were in existence
only half the time </s>
<s>   continual engagements at home and abroad however
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education </s>
<s>  supported the
good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his
wife </s>
<s> 

lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of
all her domestic arrangements </s>
<s>  and from this kind of vanity was her
greatest enjoyment in any of their parties </s>
<s>   but sir johns
satisfaction in society was much more real </s>
<s>  he delighted in collecting
about him more young people than his house would hold and the noisier
they were the better was he pleased </s>
<s>   he was a blessing to all the
juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever
forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter
his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen </s>
<s> 

the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants
he had now procured for his cottage at barton </s>
<s>   the miss dashwoods were
young pretty and unaffected </s>
<s>   it was enough to secure his good
opinion </s>
<s>  for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
make her mind as captivating as her person </s>
<s>   the friendliness of his
disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation
might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate </s>
<s>   in
showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
of a good heart </s>
<s>  and in settling a family of females only in his
cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman </s>

not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
residence within his own manor </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by
sir john who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity </s>

and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day
before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them </s>

would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself </s>
<s>  a
particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very
young nor very gay </s>

had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some
addition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was full
of engagements </s>
<s>   luckily lady middletons mother had arrived at barton
within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman
he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might
imagine </s>
<s>   the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly
satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for
no more </s>

fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and
rather vulgar </s>
<s>   she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands </s>
<s>  hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex

vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned her eyes towards elinor

resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to be
his wife or <abvr> jennings to be lady middletons mother </s>
<s>   he was
silent and grave </s>
<s>   his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite
of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old
bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty </s>
<s>  but though
his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his
address was particularly gentlemanlike </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
companions to the dashwoods </s>
<s>  but the cold insipidity of lady middleton
was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of
colonel brandon and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his
motherinlaw was interesting </s>
<s>   lady middleton seemed to be roused to
enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner
who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of
discourse except what related to themselves </s>
<s> 

in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she was
invited to play </s>
<s>   the instrument was unlocked every body prepared to
be charmed and marianne who sang very well at their request went
through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since in
the same position on the pianoforte for her ladyship had celebrated
that event by giving up music although by her mothers account she
had played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it </s>
<s> 

mariannes performance was highly applauded </s>
<s>   sir john was loud in his
admiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversation
with the others while every song lasted </s>
<s>   lady middleton frequently
called him to order wondered how any ones attention could be diverted
from music for a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song
which marianne had just finished </s>
<s>   colonel brandon alone of all the
party heard her without being in raptures </s>
<s>   he paid her only the
compliment of attention </s>
<s>  and she felt a respect for him on the
occasion which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
want of taste </s>
<s>   his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was
estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the
others </s>
<s>  and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and
thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
exquisite power of enjoyment </s>
<s>   she was perfectly disposed to make every
allowance for the colonels advanced state of life which humanity
required </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was a widow with an ample jointure </s>
<s>   she had only two
daughters both of whom she had lived to see respectably married and
she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world </s>
<s>   in the promotion of this object she was zealously active as
far as her ability reached </s>
<s>  and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance </s>
<s>   she was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
insinuations of her power over such a young man </s>
<s>  and this kind of
discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to
pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne
dashwood </s>
<s>   she rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening
of their being together from his listening so attentively while she
sang to them </s>
<s>  and when the visit was returned by the middletons dining
at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again </s>
<s> 
it must be so </s>
<s>   she was perfectly convinced of it </s>
<s>   it would be an
excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since her
connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge </s>
<s>  and she
was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl </s>
<s> 

the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable for
it supplied her with endless jokes against them both </s>
<s>   at the park she
laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at marianne </s>
<s>   to the former
her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself
perfectly indifferent </s>
<s>  but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible </s>
<s>  and when its object was understood she hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence
for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonels
advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood who could not think a man five years younger than
herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of
her daughter ventured to clear <abvr> jennings from the probability of
wishing to throw ridicule on his age </s>
<s> 

but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation
though you may not think it intentionally illnatured </s>
<s>   colonel brandon
is certainly younger than <abvr> jennings but he is old enough to be my
father </s>
<s>  and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have
long outlived every sensation of the kind </s>
<s>   it is too ridiculous </s>
<s>   when
is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not
protect him </s>
<s> 

infirmity </s>
<s>  said elinor do you call colonel brandon infirm </s>
<s>   i can
easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother </s>
<s>  but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of
his limbs </s>
<s> 

did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism </s>
<s>   and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life </s>
<s> 

my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must
be in continual terror of my decay </s>
<s>  and it must seem to you a miracle
that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty </s>
<s> 

mama you are not doing me justice </s>
<s>   i know very well that colonel
brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of
losing him in the course of nature </s>
<s>   he may live twenty years longer </s>
<s> 
but thirtyfive has nothing to do with matrimony </s>
<s> 

perhaps said elinor thirtyfive and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together </s>
<s>   but if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should
not think colonel brandons being thirtyfive any objection to his
marrying her </s>
<s> 

a woman of seven and twenty said marianne after pausing a moment
can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be
uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring
herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife </s>
<s>   in his marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable </s>
<s>   it would be a compact of
convenience and the world would be satisfied </s>
<s>   in my eyes it would be
no marriage at all but that would be nothing </s>
<s>   to me it would seem
only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the
expense of the other </s>
<s> 

it would be impossible i know replied elinor to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirtyfive
anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her </s>
<s> 
but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to
complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his shoulders </s>
<s> 

but he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne </s>
<s>  and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps
rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble </s>
<s> 

had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him
half so much </s>
<s>   confess marianne is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever </s>
<s> 

soon after this upon elinors leaving the room mama said
marianne i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot
conceal from you </s>
<s>   i am sure edward ferrars is not well </s>
<s>   we have now
been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come </s>
<s>   nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay </s>
<s>   what else
can detain him at norland </s>
<s> 

had you any idea of his coming so soon </s>
<s>  said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   i had
none </s>
<s>   on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his
coming to barton </s>
<s>   does elinor expect him already </s>
<s> 

i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must </s>
<s> 

i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed
that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the
room would be wanted for some time </s>
<s> 

how strange this is </s>
<s>  what can be the meaning of it </s>
<s>   but the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable </s>
<s>  how cold how
composed were their last adieus </s>
<s>  how languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together </s>
<s>  in edwards farewell there was no
distinction between elinor and me </s>
<s>  it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both </s>
<s>   twice did i leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most
unaccountably follow me out of the room </s>
<s>   and elinor in quitting
norland and edward cried not as i did </s>
<s>   even now her selfcommand is
invariable </s>
<s>   when is she dejected or melancholy </s>

avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it </s>

chapter 


the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves </s>
<s>   the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding
them were now become familiar and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the loss of their
father </s>
<s>   sir john middleton who called on them every day for the first
fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
home could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed </s>
<s> 

their visitors except those from barton park were not many </s>
<s>  for in
spite of sir johns urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at
their service the independence of <abvr> dashwoods spirit overcame the
wish of society for her children </s>
<s>  and she was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk </s>
<s>   there were but few who
could be so classed </s>
<s>  and it was not all of them that were attainable </s>
<s> 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding
valley of allenham which issued from that of barton as formerly
described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an
ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little
of norland interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it </s>
<s>   but they learnt on enquiry that its
possessor an elderly lady of very good character was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world and never stirred from home </s>
<s> 

the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks </s>
<s>   the high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
beauties </s>
<s>  and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one
memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine
of a showery sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned </s>
<s>   the weather was
not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
book in spite of mariannes declaration that the day would be
lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
from their hills </s>
<s>  and the two girls set off together </s>
<s> 

they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky </s>
<s>  and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high southwesterly wind they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations </s>
<s> 

is there a felicity in the world said marianne superior to
this </s>
<s> margaret we will walk here at least two hours </s>
<s> 

margaret agreed and they pursued their way against the wind resisting
it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly
the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in
their face </s>
<s>  chagrined and surprised they were obliged though
unwillingly to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own
house </s>
<s>   one consolation however remained for them to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety </s>
<s>  it was that of
running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
led immediately to their garden gate </s>
<s> 

they set off </s>
<s>   marianne had at first the advantage but a false step
brought her suddenly to the ground </s>
<s>  and margaret unable to stop
herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the
bottom in safety </s>
<s> 

a gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers playing round him was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne when her
accident happened </s>
<s>   he put down his gun and ran to her assistance </s>
<s>   she
had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in
her fall and she was scarcely able to stand </s>
<s>   the gentleman offered
his services </s>
<s>  and perceiving that her modesty declined what her
situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther
delay and carried her down the hill </s>
<s>   then passing through the garden
the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly
into the house whither margaret was just arrived and quitted not his
hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour </s>
<s> 

elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for
his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received
additional charms from his voice and expression </s>
<s>   had he been even old
ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of <abvr> dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her child </s>
<s>  but the
influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the
action which came home to her feelings </s>
<s> 

she thanked him again and again </s>
<s>  and with a sweetness of address which
always attended her invited him to be seated </s>
<s>   but this he declined
as he was dirty and wet </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood then begged to know to whom she
was obliged </s>
<s>   his name he replied was willoughby and his present
home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would allow him the
honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood </s>
<s>   the honour
was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more
interesting in the midst of a heavy rain </s>
<s> 

his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry raised
against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior
attractions </s>
<s>  marianne herself had seen less of his mama the
rest for the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his lifting
her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their
entering the house </s>
<s>   but she had seen enough of him to join in all the
admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her
praise </s>
<s>   his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story </s>
<s>  and in his carrying her into the
house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of
thought which particularly recommended the action to her </s>
<s>   every
circumstance belonging to him was interesting </s>
<s>   his name was good his
residence was in their favourite village and she soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shootingjacket was the most becoming </s>
<s>   her
imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded </s>
<s> 

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him to get out of doors </s>
<s>  and mariannes accident
being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any
gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham </s>
<s> 

willoughby </s>
<s>  cried sir john </s>
<s>  what is he in the country </s>
<s>  that is good
news however </s>
<s>  i will ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on
thursday </s>
<s> 

you know him then said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s> 

know him </s>
<s>  to be sure i do </s>
<s>   why he is down here every year </s>
<s> 

and what sort of a young man is he </s>
<s> 

as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you </s>
<s>   a very decent
shot and there is not a bolder rider in england </s>
<s> 

and is that all you can say for him </s>
<s>  cried marianne indignantly </s>
<s> 
but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance </s>
<s>  what his
pursuits his talents and genius </s>
<s> 

sir john was rather puzzled </s>
<s> 

upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that </s>
<s> 
but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest
little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw </s>
<s>   was she out with him
today </s>
<s> 

but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of <abvr>
willoughbys pointer than he could describe to her the shades of his
mind </s>
<s> 

but who is he </s>
<s>  said elinor </s>
<s>   where does he come from </s>
<s>   has he a
house at allenham </s>
<s> 

on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence </s>
<s>  and he
told them that <abvr> willoughby had no property of his own in the
country </s>
<s>  that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady
at allenham court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was
to inherit </s>
<s>  adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can
tell you miss dashwood </s>
<s>  he has a pretty little estate of his own in
somersetshire besides </s>
<s>  and if i were you i would not give him up to my
younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills </s>
<s>   miss
marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself </s>
<s>   brandon will
be jealous if she does not take care </s>
<s> 

i do not believe said <abvr> dashwood with a good humoured smile
that <abvr> willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my
daughters towards what you call catching him </s>
<s>   it is not an employment
to which they have been brought up </s>
<s>   men are very safe with us let
them be ever so rich </s>
<s>   i am glad to find however from what you say
that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not
be ineligible </s>
<s> 

he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated
sir john </s>
<s>   i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he
danced from eight oclock till four without once sitting down </s>
<s> 

did he indeed </s>
<s>  cried marianne with sparkling eyes and with
elegance with spirit </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and he was up again at eight to ride to covert </s>
<s> 

that is what i like </s>
<s>  that is what a young man ought to be </s>
<s>   whatever
be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and
leave him no sense of fatigue </s>
<s> 

aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be </s>
<s> 
you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor
brandon </s>
<s> 

that is an expression sir john said marianne warmly which i
particularly dislike </s>
<s>   i abhor every commonplace phrase by which wit
is intended </s>
<s>  and setting ones cap at a man or making a conquest
are the most odious of all </s>
<s>   their tendency is gross and illiberal </s>
<s>  and
if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity </s>
<s> 

sir john did not much understand this reproof </s>
<s>  but he laughed as
heartily as if he did and then replied

ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other </s>
<s> 
poor brandon </s>
<s>  he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth
setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling
about and spraining of ankles </s>

chapter 


mariannes preserver as margaret with more elegance than precision
styled willoughby called at the cottage early the next morning to make
his personal enquiries </s>
<s>   he was received by <abvr> dashwood with more
than politeness </s>
<s>  with a kindness which sir johns account of him and
her own gratitude prompted </s>
<s>  and every thing that passed during the
visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance mutual affection
and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
him </s>
<s>   of their personal charms he had not required a second interview
to be convinced </s>
<s> 

miss dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a
remarkably pretty figure </s>
<s>   marianne was still handsomer </s>
<s>   her form
though not so correct as her sisters in having the advantage of
height was more striking </s>
<s>  and her face was so lovely that when in the
common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less
violently outraged than usually happens </s>
<s>   her skin was very brown but
from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant </s>
<s>  her
features were all good </s>
<s>  her smile was sweet and attractive </s>
<s>  and in her
eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness
which could hardily be seen without delight </s>
<s>   from willoughby their
expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the
remembrance of his assistance created </s>
<s>   but when this passed away when
her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect
goodbreeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and
above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was
passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured
the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay </s>
<s> 

it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her
to talk </s>
<s>   she could not be silent when such points were introduced and
she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion </s>
<s>   they speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
to either </s>
<s>   encouraged by this to a further examination of his
opinions she proceeded to question him on the subject of books </s>
<s>  her
favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous
a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been
insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
of such works however disregarded before </s>
<s>   their taste was strikingly
alike </s>
<s>   the same books the same passages were idolized by eachor if
any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than
till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be
displayed </s>
<s>   he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her
enthusiasm </s>
<s>  and long before his visit concluded they conversed with
the familiarity of a longestablished acquaintance </s>
<s> 

well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them for one
morning i think you have done pretty well </s>
<s>   you have already
ascertained <abvr> willoughbys opinion in almost every matter of
importance </s>
<s>   you know what he thinks of cowper and scott </s>
<s>  you are
certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have
received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper </s>
<s> 
but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse </s>
<s>   you will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic </s>
<s>   another meeting will suffice to
explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and
then you can have nothing farther to ask </s>
<s> 

elinor cried marianne is this fair </s>
<s>  is this just </s>
<s>  are my ideas so
scanty </s>
<s>   but i see what you mean </s>
<s>   i have been too much at my ease too
happy too frank </s>
<s>   i have erred against every commonplace notion of
decorum </s>
<s>  i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been
reserved spiritless dull and deceitfulhad i talked only of the
weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this
reproach would have been spared </s>
<s> 

my love said her mother you must not be offended with elinorshe
was only in jest </s>
<s>   i should scold her myself if she were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend </s>
<s>  marianne was softened in a moment </s>
<s> 

willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their
acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer </s>
<s>   he
came to them every day </s>
<s>   to enquire after marianne was at first his
excuse </s>
<s>  but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave
greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
to be possible by mariannes perfect recovery </s>
<s>   she was confined for
some days to the house </s>
<s>  but never had any confinement been less
irksome </s>
<s>   willoughby was a young man of good abilities quick
imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners </s>
<s>   he was
exactly formed to engage mariannes heart for with all this he joined
not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was
now roused and increased by the example of her own and which
recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else </s>
<s> 

his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment </s>
<s>   they read
they talked they sang together </s>
<s>  his musical talents were considerable </s>
<s> 
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had
unfortunately wanted </s>
<s> 

in <abvr> dashwoods estimation he was as faultless as in mariannes </s>
<s>  and
elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too
much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or
circumstances </s>
<s>   in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other
people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinor
could not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in
its support </s>
<s> 

marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her
ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable </s>
<s>   willoughby was
all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period as capable of attaching her </s>
<s>  and his behaviour
declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities
were strong </s>
<s> 

her mother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the
end of a week to hope and expect it </s>
<s>  and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sonsinlaw as edward and willoughby </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons partiality for marianne which had so early been
discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to elinor when
it ceased to be noticed by them </s>
<s>   their attention and wit were drawn
off to his more fortunate rival </s>
<s>  and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility </s>
<s> 
elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments
which <abvr> jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now
actually excited by her sister </s>
<s>  and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of <abvr>
willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon </s>
<s>   she saw it with concern </s>
<s> 
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty </s>
<s>  and as she could not even wish him
successful she heartily wished him indifferent </s>
<s>   she liked himin
spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of
interest </s>
<s>   his manners though serious were mild </s>
<s>  and his reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
natural gloominess of temper </s>
<s>   sir john had dropped hints of past
injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being
an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion </s>
<s> 

perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by
willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither
lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits </s>
<s> 

brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when they
were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and
nobody cares about </s>
<s>  whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers
to talk to </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne </s>
<s> 

do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice in
both of you </s>
<s>   he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and
i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him </s>
<s> 

that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly in
his favour </s>
<s>  but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in
itself </s>
<s>   who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as lady middleton and <abvr> jennings that could command the
indifference of any body else </s>

make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother </s>

praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more

in defence of your protege you can even be saucy </s>

my protege as you call him is a sensible man </s>

have attractions for me </s>
<s>   yes marianne even in a man between thirty
and forty </s>
<s>   he has seen a great deal of the world </s>
<s>  has been abroad has
read and has a thinking mind </s>
<s>   i have found him capable of giving me
much information on various subjects </s>

inquiries with readiness of goodbreeding and good nature </s>
<s> 

that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that
in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are
troublesome </s>
<s> 

he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries

perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins </s>

i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further

i do not dislike him </s>

respectable man who has every bodys good word and nobodys notice </s>

who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to
employ and two new coats every year </s>

add to which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor
spirit </s>
<s>   that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no
ardour and his voice no expression </s>
<s> 

you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied elinor
and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the
commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and
insipid </s>

chapter 


little had <abvr> dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came
into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such
frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment </s>
<s>   yet such was the case </s>
<s>   when marianne
was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir
john had been previously forming were put into execution </s>
<s>   the private
balls at the park then began </s>
<s>  and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery october would allow </s>
<s>   in every
meeting of the kind willoughby was included </s>
<s>  and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the
dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving
in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her
affection </s>
<s> 

elinor could not be surprised at their attachment </s>
<s>   she only wished
that it were less openly shewn </s>
<s>  and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some selfcommand to marianne </s>
<s>   but marianne
abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve </s>
<s> 
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a
disgraceful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions </s>
<s> 
willoughby thought the same </s>
<s>  and their behaviour at all times was an
illustration of their opinions </s>
<s> 

when he was present she had no eyes for any one else </s>
<s>   every thing he
did was right </s>
<s>   every thing he said was clever </s>
<s>   if their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest
of the party to get her a good hand </s>
<s>   if dancing formed the amusement
of the night they were partners for half the time </s>
<s>  and when obliged to
separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and
scarcely spoke a word to any body else </s>
<s>   such conduct made them of
course most exceedingly laughed at </s>
<s>  but ridicule could not shame and
seemed hardly to provoke them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them </s>
<s>   to her
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
ardent mind </s>
<s> 

this was the season of happiness to marianne </s>
<s>   her heart was devoted to
willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with
her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it
possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her
present home </s>
<s> 

elinors happiness was not so great </s>
<s>   her heart was not so much at
ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure </s>
<s>   they afforded
her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind
nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than
ever </s>
<s>   neither lady middleton nor <abvr> jennings could supply to her the
conversation she missed </s>
<s>  although the latter was an everlasting talker
and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a
large share of her discourse </s>
<s>   she had already repeated her own history
to elinor three or four times </s>
<s>  and had elinors memory been equal to
her means of improvement she might have known very early in their
acquaintance all the particulars of <abvr> jenningss last illness and
what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died </s>
<s>   lady middleton
was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent </s>
<s>   elinor
needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere
calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do </s>
<s>   towards her
husband and mother she was the same as to them </s>
<s>  and intimacy was
therefore neither to be looked for nor desired </s>
<s>   she had nothing to say
one day that she had not said the day before </s>
<s>   her insipidity was
invariable for even her spirits were always the same </s>
<s>  and though she
did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every
thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her
she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might
have experienced in sitting at home </s>
<s> and so little did her presence
add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her
solicitude about her troublesome boys </s>
<s> 

in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite
the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion </s>
<s> 
willoughby was out of the question </s>
<s>   her admiration and regard even
her sisterly regard was all his own </s>
<s>  but he was a lover </s>
<s>  his
attentions were wholly mariannes and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing </s>
<s>   colonel brandon unfortunately for
himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in
conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her sister </s>
<s> 

elinors compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him </s>
<s> 
this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from
him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent while the others were dancing </s>
<s>   his eyes were fixed on
marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint
smile your sister i understand does not approve of second
attachments </s>
<s> 

no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic </s>
<s> 

or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist </s>
<s> 

i believe she does </s>
<s>   but how she contrives it without reflecting on
the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not </s>
<s> 
a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of
common sense and observation </s>
<s>  and then they may be more easy to define
and to justify than they now are by any body but herself </s>
<s> 

this will probably be the case he replied </s>
<s>  and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions </s>
<s> 

i cannot agree with you there said elinor </s>
<s>   there are
inconveniences attending such feelings as mariannes which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for </s>
<s>   her
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought </s>
<s>  and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward
to as her greatest possible advantage </s>
<s> 

after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying

does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a
second attachment </s>
<s>  or is it equally criminal in every body </s>
<s>   are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the
inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives </s>
<s> 

upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles </s>
<s> 
i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second
attachments being pardonable </s>
<s> 

this said he cannot hold </s>
<s>  but a change a total change of
sentimentsno no do not desire it </s>
<s>  for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous </s>
<s>   i
speak from experience </s>
<s>   i once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who
from an inforced changefrom a series of unfortunate circumstances
here he stopt suddenly </s>
<s>  appeared to think that he had said too much
and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not
otherwise have entered elinors head </s>
<s>   the lady would probably have
passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what
concerned her ought not to escape his lips </s>
<s>   as it was it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard </s>
<s>   elinor attempted no more </s>
<s>   but marianne
in her place would not have done so little </s>
<s>   the whole story would
have been speedily formed under her active imagination </s>
<s>  and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love </s>
<s> 



chapter 


as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite of
all that she knew before of mariannes imprudence and want of thought
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both </s>
<s>   marianne told her
with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one
that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman </s>
<s>   without considering that it was
not in her mothers plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter
her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the
servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable
to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and
told her sister of it in raptures </s>
<s> 

he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it
she added and when it arrives we will ride every day </s>
<s>   you shall
share its use with me </s>
<s>   imagine to yourself my dear elinor the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs </s>
<s> 

most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair </s>
<s>  and for
some time she refused to submit to them </s>
<s>   as to an additional servant
the expense would be a trifle </s>
<s>  mama she was sure would never object to
it </s>
<s>  and any horse would do for him </s>
<s>  he might always get one at the
park </s>
<s>  as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient </s>
<s>   elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a
man so little or at least so lately known to her </s>
<s>   this was too much </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken elinor said she warmly in supposing i know very
little of willoughby </s>
<s>   i have not known him long indeed but i am much
better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the
world except yourself and mama </s>
<s>   it is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy </s>
<s> it is disposition alone </s>
<s>   seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven
days are more than enough for others </s>
<s>   i should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from
willoughby </s>
<s>   of john i know very little though we have lived together
for years </s>
<s>  but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed </s>
<s> 

elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more </s>
<s>   she knew her
sisters temper </s>
<s>   opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her the more to her own opinion </s>
<s>   but by an appeal to her affection for
her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she
consented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly
subdued </s>
<s>  and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw
him next that it must be declined </s>
<s> 

she was faithful to her word </s>
<s>  and when willoughby called at the
cottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment to
him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his
present </s>
<s>   the reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side
impossible </s>
<s>   his concern however was very apparent </s>
<s>  and after
expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voicebut
marianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now </s>
<s>   i
shall keep it only till you can claim it </s>
<s>   when you leave barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall
receive you </s>
<s> 

this was all overheard by miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and in the whole of the
sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her
sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so
decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between
them </s>
<s>   from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each
other </s>
<s>  and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or
any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover
it by accident </s>
<s> 

margaret related something to her the next day which placed this
matter in a still clearer light </s>
<s>   willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour
with only him and marianne had had opportunity for observations
which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest
sister when they were next by themselves </s>
<s> 

oh elinor </s>
<s>  she cried i have such a secret to tell you about
marianne </s>
<s>   i am sure she will be married to <abvr> willoughby very soon </s>
<s> 

you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first
met on highchurch down </s>
<s>  and they had not known each other a week i
believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round
her neck </s>
<s>  but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle </s>
<s> 

but indeed this is quite another thing </s>
<s>   i am sure they will be
married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair </s>
<s> 

take care margaret </s>
<s>   it may be only the hair of some great uncle of
his </s>
<s> 

but indeed elinor it is mariannes </s>
<s>  i am almost sure it is for i
saw him cut it off </s>
<s>   last night after tea when you and mama went out
of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took
up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all
tumbled down her back </s>
<s>  and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of
white paper </s>
<s>  and put it into his pocketbook </s>
<s> 

for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not
withhold her credit </s>
<s>  nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself </s>
<s> 

margarets sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her sister </s>
<s>   when <abvr> jennings attacked her one evening at the
park to give the name of the young man who was elinors particular
favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her
margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not
tell may i elinor </s>
<s> 

this of course made every body laugh </s>
<s>  and elinor tried to laugh too </s>
<s> 
but the effort was painful </s>
<s>   she was convinced that margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

marianne felt for her most sincerely </s>
<s>  but she did more harm than good
to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
margaret

remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to
repeat them </s>
<s> 

i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret </s>
<s>  it was you
who told me of it yourself </s>
<s> 

this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  pray miss margaret let us know all about it said <abvr>
jennings </s>
<s>   what is the gentlemans name </s>
<s> 

i must not tell maam </s>
<s>  but i know very well what it is </s>
<s>  and i know
where he is too </s>
<s> 

yes yes we can guess where he is </s>
<s>  at his own house at norland to be
sure </s>
<s>   he is the curate of the parish i dare say </s>
<s> 

no that he is not </s>
<s>   he is of no profession at all </s>
<s> 

margaret said marianne with great warmth you know that all this is
an invention of your own and that there is no such person in
existence </s>
<s> 

well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such
a man once and his name begins with an f </s>
<s> 

most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this
moment that it rained very hard though she believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her
ladyships great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her husband and mother </s>
<s>   the idea however started by her was
immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others </s>
<s>  and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them </s>
<s>   willoughby opened the pianoforte and asked
marianne to sit down to it </s>
<s>  and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground </s>
<s>   but not so
easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her </s>
<s> 

a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
very fine place about twelve miles from barton belonging to a
brotherinlaw of colonel brandon without whose interest it could not
be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders
on that head </s>
<s>   the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and
sir john who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed
to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at
least twice every summer for the last ten years </s>
<s>   they contained a
noble piece of water </s>
<s>  a sail on which was to a form a great part of the
mornings amusement </s>
<s>  cold provisions were to be taken open carriages
only to be employed and every thing conducted in the usual style of a
complete party of pleasure </s>
<s> 

to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking
considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight </s>
<s> and <abvr> dashwood who had already a cold was
persuaded by elinor to stay at home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from
what elinor had expected </s>
<s>   she was prepared to be wet through
fatigued and frightened </s>
<s>  but the event was still more unfortunate for
they did not go at all </s>
<s> 

by ten oclock the whole party was assembled at the park where they
were to breakfast </s>
<s>   the morning was rather favourable though it had
rained all night as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky
and the sun frequently appeared </s>
<s>   they were all in high spirits and
good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the
greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise </s>
<s> 

while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in </s>
<s>   among the
rest there was one for colonel brandon </s>
<s> he took it looked at the
direction changed colour and immediately left the room </s>
<s> 

what is the matter with brandon </s>
<s>  said sir john </s>
<s> 

nobody could tell </s>
<s> 

i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton </s>
<s>   it must be
something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly </s>
<s> 

in about five minutes he returned </s>
<s> 

no bad news colonel i hope </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jennings as soon as he
entered the room </s>
<s> 

none at all maam i thank you </s>
<s> 

was it from avignon </s>
<s>   i hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse </s>
<s> 

no maam </s>
<s>  it came from town and is merely a letter of business </s>
<s> 

but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a
letter of business </s>
<s>   come come this wont do colonel </s>
<s>  so let us hear
the truth of it </s>
<s> 

my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying </s>
<s> 

perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married </s>
<s>  said
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings without attending to her daughters reproof </s>
<s> 

no indeed it is not </s>
<s> 

well then i know who it is from colonel </s>
<s>   and i hope she is well </s>
<s> 

whom do you mean maam </s>
<s>  said he colouring a little </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you know who i mean </s>
<s> 

i am particularly sorry maam said he addressing lady middleton
that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town </s>
<s> 

in town </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   what can you have to do in town at
this time of year </s>
<s> 

my own loss is great he continued in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party </s>
<s>  but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell </s>
<s> 

what a blow upon them all was this </s>
<s> 

but if you write a note to the housekeeper <abvr> brandon said
marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient </s>
<s> 

he shook his head </s>
<s> 

we must go said sir john </s>
<s> it shall not be put off when we are so
near it </s>
<s>   you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all </s>
<s> 

i wish it could be so easily settled </s>
<s>   but it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day </s>
<s> 

if you would but let us know what your business is said <abvr>
jennings we might see whether it could be put off or not </s>
<s> 

you would not be six hours later said willoughby if you were to
defer your journey till our return </s>
<s> 

i cannot afford to lose one hour </s>
<s> 

elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne there
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure </s>
<s>   brandon is one of
them </s>
<s>   he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this
trick for getting out of it </s>
<s>   i would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his own writing </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of it replied marianne </s>
<s> 

there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of
old said sir john when once you are determined on anything </s>
<s>   but
however i hope you will think better of it </s>
<s>   consider here are the
two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked
up from the cottage and <abvr> willoughby got up two hours before his
usual time on purpose to go to whitwell </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party </s>
<s>  but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable </s>
<s> 

well then when will you come back again </s>
<s> 

i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as
you can conveniently leave town </s>
<s>  and we must put off the party to
whitwell till you return </s>
<s> 

you are very obliging </s>
<s>   but it is so uncertain when i may have it in
my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he must and shall come back cried sir john </s>
<s>   if he is not here
by the end of the week i shall go after him </s>
<s> 

ay so do sir john cried <abvr> jennings and then perhaps you may
find out what his business is </s>
<s> 

i do not want to pry into other mens concerns </s>
<s>   i suppose it is
something he is ashamed of </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons horses were announced </s>
<s> 

you do not go to town on horseback do you </s>
<s>  added sir john </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  only to honiton </s>
<s>   i shall then go post </s>
<s> 

well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey </s>
<s>   but you
had better change your mind </s>
<s> 

i assure you it is not in my power </s>
<s> 

he then took leave of the whole party </s>
<s> 

is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

i am afraid none at all </s>
<s> 

then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to
do </s>
<s> 

to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing </s>
<s> 

come colonel said <abvr> jennings before you go do let us know what
you are going about </s>
<s> 

he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room </s>
<s> 

the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained now burst forth universally </s>
<s>  and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed </s>
<s> 

i can guess what his business is however said <abvr> jennings
exultingly </s>
<s> 

can you maam </s>
<s>  said almost every body </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  it is about miss williams i am sure </s>
<s> 

and who is miss williams </s>
<s>  asked marianne </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  do not you know who miss williams is </s>
<s>  i am sure you must have
heard of her before </s>
<s>   she is a relation of the colonels my dear </s>
<s>  a
very near relation </s>
<s>   we will not say how near for fear of shocking the
young ladies </s>
<s>  then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor
she is his natural daughter </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  and as like him as she can stare </s>
<s>   i dare say the colonel
will leave her all his fortune </s>
<s> 

when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event </s>
<s>  concluding however by observing that as
they were all got together they must do something by way of being
happy </s>
<s>  and after some consultation it was agreed that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country </s>
<s>   the
carriages were then ordered </s>
<s>  willoughbys was first and marianne never
looked happier than when she got into it </s>
<s>   he drove through the park
very fast and they were soon out of sight </s>
<s>  and nothing more of them
was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return
of all the rest </s>
<s>   they both seemed delighted with their drive </s>
<s>  but said
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others
went on the downs </s>
<s> 

it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long </s>
<s>   some more of the
careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment </s>
<s> 
willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings sat on elinors right hand </s>
<s>  and they had not been long
seated before she leant behind her and willoughby and said to
marianne loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in
spite of all your tricks </s>
<s>   i know where you spent the morning </s>
<s> 

marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray </s>
<s> 

did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in my
curricle </s>
<s> 

yes yes <abvr> impudence i know that very well and i was determined
to find out where you had been to </s>
<s>  i hope you like your house miss
marianne </s>
<s>   it is a very large one i know </s>
<s>  and when i come to see you
i hope you will have newfurnished it for it wanted it very much when
i was there six years ago </s>
<s> 

marianne turned away in great confusion </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings laughed
heartily </s>
<s>  and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they
had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of <abvr>
willoughbys groom </s>
<s>  and that she had by that method been informed that
they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house </s>
<s> 

elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely
that willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the house
while <abvr> smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

as soon as they left the diningroom elinor enquired of her about it </s>
<s> 
and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance
related by <abvr> jennings was perfectly true </s>
<s>   marianne was quite angry
with her for doubting it </s>
<s> 

why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we
did not see the house </s>
<s>   is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself </s>
<s> 

yes marianne but i would not go while <abvr> smith was there and with
no other companion than <abvr> willoughby </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew
that house </s>
<s>  and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to
have any other companion </s>
<s>   i never spent a pleasanter morning in my
life </s>
<s> 

i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety </s>
<s> 

on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor </s>
<s>  for if
there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been
sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting
wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure </s>
<s> 

but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct </s>
<s> 

if the impertinent remarks of <abvr> jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives </s>
<s> 
i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation </s>
<s>   i
am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over <abvr>
smiths grounds or in seeing her house </s>
<s>   they will one day be <abvr>
willoughbys and

if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be
justified in what you have done </s>
<s> 

she blushed at this hint </s>
<s>  but it was even visibly gratifying to her </s>
<s> 
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her
sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was
rather illjudged in me to go to allenham </s>
<s>  but <abvr> willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place </s>
<s>  and it is a charming house i assure
you </s>
<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs </s>
<s>  of a nice
comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would
be delightful </s>
<s>   it is a corner room and has windows on two sides </s>
<s>   on
one side you look across the bowlinggreen behind the house to a
beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church
and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired </s>
<s>   i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniturebut if it were newly fitted upa
couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the
pleasantest summerrooms in england </s>
<s> 

could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others
she would have described every room in the house with equal delight </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the sudden termination of colonel brandons visit at the park with his
steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the
wonder of <abvr> jennings for two or three days </s>
<s>  she was a great
wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance </s>
<s>   she wondered with
little intermission what could be the reason of it </s>
<s>  was sure there must
be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could
have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape
them all </s>
<s> 

something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she </s>
<s> 
i could see it in his face </s>
<s>   poor man </s>
<s>   i am afraid his circumstances
may be bad </s>
<s>   the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved </s>
<s>   i do
think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can
it be </s>
<s>   i wonder whether it is so </s>
<s>   i would give anything to know the
truth of it </s>
<s>   perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare
say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her </s>
<s>   may be
she is ill in town </s>
<s>  nothing in the world more likely for i have a
notion she is always rather sickly </s>
<s>   i would lay any wager it is about
miss williams </s>
<s>   it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his
circumstances now for he is a very prudent man and to be sure must
have cleared the estate by this time </s>
<s>   i wonder what it can be </s>
<s>   may be
his sister is worse at avignon and has sent for him over </s>
<s>   his setting
off in such a hurry seems very like it </s>
<s>   well i wish him out of all
his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain </s>
<s> 

so wondered so talked <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   her opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose </s>
<s> 
elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel
brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away
which <abvr> jennings was desirous of her feeling </s>
<s>  for besides that the
circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of </s>
<s>   it was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on
the subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all </s>
<s>   as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both </s>
<s>   why they should
not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not
imagine </s>
<s> 

she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power </s>
<s>  for though willoughby was independent there was no reason
to believe him rich </s>
<s>   his estate had been rated by sir john at about
six or seven hundred a year </s>
<s>  but he lived at an expense to which that
income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of
his poverty </s>
<s>   but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all
she could not account </s>
<s>  and it was so wholly contradictory to their
general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her
making any inquiry of marianne </s>
<s> 

nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than
willoughbys behaviour </s>
<s>   to marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lovers heart could give and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother </s>
<s>   the
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home </s>
<s>  many more
of his hours were spent there than at allenham </s>
<s>  and if no general
engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his
favourite pointer at her feet </s>
<s> 

one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left the
country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him </s>
<s>  and on <abvr> dashwoods happening
to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly
opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
perfect with him </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  he exclaimedimprove this dear cottage </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  that i will
never consent to </s>
<s>   not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch
to its size if my feelings are regarded </s>
<s> 

do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will be
done </s>
<s>  for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it </s>
<s> 

i am heartily glad of it he cried </s>
<s>   may she always be poor if she
can employ her riches no better </s>
<s> 

thank you willoughby </s>
<s>   but you may be assured that i would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one
whom i loved for all the improvements in the world </s>
<s>   depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in
the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you </s>
<s>   but are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it </s>
<s> 

i am said he </s>
<s>   to me it is faultless </s>
<s>   nay more i consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i
rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in
the exact plan of this cottage </s>
<s> 

with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said
elinor </s>
<s> 

yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing
belonging to it </s>
<s> in no one convenience or inconvenience about it
should the least variation be perceptible </s>
<s>   then and then only under
such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at
barton </s>
<s> 

i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this </s>
<s> 

there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might
greatly endear it to me </s>
<s>  but this place will always have one claim of
my affection which no other can possibly share </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she
understood him </s>
<s> 

how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time
twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited </s>
<s>   i never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one
should live in it </s>
<s>   how little did i then think that the very first
news i should hear from <abvr> smith when i next came into the country
would be that barton cottage was taken </s>
<s>  and i felt an immediate
satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of
prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account
for </s>
<s>   must it not have been so marianne </s>
<s>  speaking to her in a lowered
voice </s>
<s>   then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house
you would spoil <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   you would rob it of its simplicity by
imaginary improvement </s>
<s>  and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance
and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
could possibly afford </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted </s>
<s> 

you are a good woman he warmly replied </s>
<s>   your promise makes me
easy </s>
<s>   extend it a little farther and it will make me happy </s>
<s>   tell me
that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever
find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling </s>
<s>  and that you will
always consider me with the kindness which has made everything
belonging to you so dear to me </s>
<s> 

the promise was readily given and willoughbys behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness </s>
<s> 

shall we see you tomorrow to dinner </s>
<s>  said <abvr> dashwood when he was
leaving them </s>
<s>   i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must
walk to the park to call on lady middleton </s>
<s> 

he engaged to be with them by four oclock </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place the next day and
two of her daughters went with her </s>
<s>  but marianne excused herself from
being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment </s>
<s>  and her
mother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the
night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly
satisfied with her remaining at home </s>
<s> 

on their return from the park they found willoughbys curricle and
servant in waiting at the cottage and <abvr> dashwood was convinced that
her conjecture had been just </s>
<s>   so far it was all as she had foreseen </s>
<s> 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her
to expect </s>
<s>   they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came
hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her
handkerchief at her eyes </s>
<s>  and without noticing them ran up stairs </s>
<s> 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had
just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against
the mantelpiece with his back towards them </s>
<s>   he turned round on their
coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the
emotion which overpowered marianne </s>
<s> 

is anything the matter with her </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> dashwood as she
enteredis she ill </s>
<s> 

i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful </s>
<s>  and with a forced
smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be illfor i
am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment </s>
<s> 

disappointment </s>
<s> 

yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you </s>
<s>   <abvr> smith has
this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
cousin by sending me on business to london </s>
<s>   i have just received my
dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham </s>
<s>  and by way of
exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you </s>
<s> 

to london </s>
<s> and are you going this morning </s>
<s> 

almost this moment </s>
<s> 

this is very unfortunate </s>
<s>   but <abvr> smith must be obliged </s>
<s> and her
business will not detain you from us long i hope </s>
<s> 

he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of
returning into devonshire immediately </s>
<s>   my visits to <abvr> smith are
never repeated within the twelvemonth </s>
<s> 

and is <abvr> smith your only friend </s>
<s>   is allenham the only house in the
neighbourhood to which you will be welcome </s>
<s>   for shame willoughby can
you wait for an invitation here </s>
<s> 

his colour increased </s>
<s>  and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only
replied you are too good </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood looked at elinor with surprise </s>
<s>   elinor felt equal
amazement </s>
<s>   for a few moments every one was silent </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood
first spoke </s>
<s> 

i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you
will always be welcome </s>
<s>  for i will not press you to return here
immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing
to <abvr> smith </s>
<s>  and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclination </s>
<s> 

my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of
such a naturethati dare not flatter myself

he stopt </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another
pause succeeded </s>
<s>   this was broken by willoughby who said with a faint
smile it is folly to linger in this manner </s>
<s>   i will not torment
myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is
impossible for me now to enjoy </s>
<s> 

he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room </s>
<s>   they saw him
step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the
parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
sudden departure occasioned </s>
<s> 

elinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers </s>
<s>   she thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust </s>
<s>   willoughbys behaviour
in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of
cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mothers
invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself
greatly disturbed her </s>
<s>   one moment she feared that no serious design
had ever been formed on his side </s>
<s>  and the next that some unfortunate
quarrel had taken place between him and her sister </s>
<s> the distress in
which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
most reasonably account for though when she considered what mariannes
love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible </s>
<s> 

but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sisters
affliction was indubitable </s>
<s>  and she thought with the tenderest
compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability
not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a
duty </s>
<s> 

in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were
red her countenance was not uncheerful </s>
<s> 

our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she
as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel </s>
<s> 

it is all very strange </s>
<s>   so suddenly to be gone </s>
<s>  it seems but the work
of a moment </s>
<s>   and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so
affectionate </s>
<s>   and now after only ten minutes noticegone too without
intending to return </s>
<s> something more than what he owned to us must have
happened </s>
<s>   he did not speak he did not behave like himself </s>
<s>   you must
have seen the difference as well as i </s>
<s>   what can it be </s>
<s>   can they have
quarrelled </s>
<s>   why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept
your invitation here </s>
<s> 

it was not inclination that he wanted elinor </s>
<s>  i could plainly see
that </s>
<s>   he had not the power of accepting it </s>
<s>   i have thought it all
over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you </s>
<s> 

can you indeed </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way </s>
<s> but
you elinor who love to doubt where you canit will not satisfy you
i know </s>
<s>  but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it </s>
<s>   i am
persuaded that <abvr> smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves
of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that
account is eager to get him away </s>
<s> and that the business which she
sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him </s>
<s> 
this is what i believe to have happened </s>
<s>   he is moreover aware that
she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present
confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself
obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and
absent himself from devonshire for a while </s>
<s>   you will tell me i know
that this may or may not have happened </s>
<s>  but i will listen to no cavil
unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
as satisfactory at this </s>
<s>   and now elinor what have you to say </s>
<s> 

nothing for you have anticipated my answer </s>
<s> 

then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened </s>
<s> 
oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings </s>
<s>   you had rather
take evil upon credit than good </s>
<s>   you had rather look out for misery
for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the
latter </s>
<s>   you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave
of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn </s>
<s>   and is
no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by
recent disappointment </s>
<s>   are no probabilities to be accepted merely
because they are not certainties </s>
<s>   is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill
of </s>
<s>   to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though
unavoidably secret for a while </s>
<s>   and after all what is it you suspect
him of </s>
<s> 

i can hardly tell myself </s>
<s>   but suspicion of something unpleasant is
the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
in him </s>
<s>   there is great truth however in what you have now urged of
the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be
candid in my judgment of every body </s>
<s>   willoughby may undoubtedly have
very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has </s>
<s> 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at
once </s>
<s>   secrecy may be advisable </s>
<s>  but still i cannot help wondering at
its being practiced by him </s>
<s> 

do not blame him however for departing from his character where the
deviation is necessary </s>
<s>   but you really do admit the justice of what i
have said in his defence </s>
<s> i am happyand he is acquitted </s>
<s> 

not entirely </s>
<s>   it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they
are engaged from <abvr> smithand if that is the case it must be
highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at
present </s>
<s>   but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us </s>
<s> 

concealing it from us </s>
<s>  my dear child do you accuse willoughby and
marianne of concealment </s>
<s>  this is strange indeed when your eyes have
been reproaching them every day for incautiousness </s>
<s> 

i want no proof of their affection said elinor </s>
<s>  but of their
engagement i do </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly satisfied of both </s>
<s> 

yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of
them </s>
<s> 

i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly </s>
<s>   has
not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last
fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future
wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation </s>
<s> 
have we not perfectly understood each other </s>
<s>   has not my consent been
daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate
respect </s>
<s>   my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement </s>
<s>   how
could such a thought occur to you </s>
<s>   how is it to be supposed that
willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sisters love should leave
her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his
affection </s>
<s> that they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence </s>
<s> 

i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is in
favour of their engagement </s>
<s>  but that one is the total silence of both
on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other </s>
<s> 

how strange this is </s>
<s>   you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby
if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the
nature of the terms on which they are together </s>
<s>   has he been acting a
part in his behaviour to your sister all this time </s>
<s>   do you suppose him
really indifferent to her </s>
<s> 

no i cannot think that </s>
<s>   he must and does love her i am sure </s>
<s> 

but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such
indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him </s>
<s> 

you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this
matter as certain </s>
<s>   i have had my doubts i confess </s>
<s>  but they are
fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away </s>
<s>   if we
find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed </s>
<s> 

a mighty concession indeed </s>
<s>   if you were to see them at the altar you
would suppose they were going to be married </s>
<s>   ungracious girl </s>
<s>   but i
require no such proof </s>
<s>   nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
justify doubt </s>
<s>  no secrecy has been attempted </s>
<s>  all has been uniformly
open and unreserved </s>
<s>   you cannot doubt your sisters wishes </s>
<s>   it must
be willoughby therefore whom you suspect </s>
<s>   but why </s>
<s>   is he not a man of
honour and feeling </s>
<s>  has there been any inconsistency on his side to
create alarm </s>
<s>  can he be deceitful </s>
<s> 

i hope not i believe not cried elinor </s>
<s>   i love willoughby
sincerely love him </s>
<s>  and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me </s>
<s>   it has been involuntary and i will
not encourage it </s>
<s>   i was startled i confess by the alteration in his
manners this morning </s>
<s> he did not speak like himself and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality </s>
<s>   but all this may be
explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed </s>
<s>   he
had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest
affliction </s>
<s>  and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending <abvr>
smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware
that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for
some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by
our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed </s>
<s>   in such a
case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more
to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general
character </s>
<s> but i will not raise objections against any ones conduct
on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself
or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent </s>
<s> 

you speak very properly </s>
<s>   willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
suspected </s>
<s>   though we have not known him long he is no stranger in
this part of the world </s>
<s>  and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage </s>
<s> 
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately
it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging
everything to me at once </s>
<s>  but this is not the case </s>
<s>   it is an
engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage
must be at a very uncertain distance </s>
<s>  and even secrecy as far as it
can be observed may now be very advisable </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret </s>
<s>  and elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to
acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all </s>
<s> 

they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the
room and took her place at the table without saying a word </s>
<s>   her eyes
were red and swollen </s>
<s>  and it seemed as if her tears were even then
restrained with difficulty </s>
<s>   she avoided the looks of them all could
neither eat nor speak and after some time on her mothers silently
pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude
was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room </s>
<s> 

this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening </s>
<s>   she
was without any power because she was without any desire of command
over herself </s>
<s>   the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby
overpowered her in an instant </s>
<s>  and though her family were most
anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they
spoke at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings
connected with him </s>
<s> 



chapter 


marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby </s>
<s>   she
would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next
morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than
when she lay down in it </s>
<s>   but the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it </s>
<s>   she was awake the
whole night and she wept the greatest part of it </s>
<s>   she got up with a
headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment </s>
<s> 
giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding all
attempt at consolation from either </s>
<s>   her sensibility was potent enough </s>
<s> 

when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about
the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning </s>
<s> 

the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling </s>
<s>   she played
over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby
every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at
the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out
for her till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
gained </s>
<s>  and this nourishment of grief was every day applied </s>
<s>   she spent
whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying </s>
<s>  her voice
often totally suspended by her tears </s>
<s>   in books too as well as in
music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
present was certain of giving </s>
<s>   she read nothing but what they had been
used to read together </s>
<s> 

such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever </s>
<s>  it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy </s>
<s>  but these employments
to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations
still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever </s>
<s> 

no letter from willoughby came </s>
<s>  and none seemed expected by marianne </s>
<s> 
her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at
least satisfied herself </s>
<s> 

remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our
letters himself from the post and carries them to it </s>
<s>   we have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
sir johns hands </s>
<s> 

elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence </s>
<s>   but there was one method so
direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she
could not help suggesting it to her mother </s>
<s> 

why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she
is not engaged to willoughby </s>
<s>   from you her mother and so kind so
indulgent a mother the question could not give offence </s>
<s>   it would be
the natural result of your affection for her </s>
<s>   she used to be all
unreserve and to you more especially </s>
<s> 

i would not ask such a question for the world </s>
<s>   supposing it possible
that they are not engaged what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict </s>
<s>   at any rate it would be most ungenerous </s>
<s>   i should never
deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one </s>
<s>   i know
mariannes heart </s>
<s>  i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not
be the last to whom the affair is made known when circumstances make
the revealment of it eligible </s>
<s>   i would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one </s>
<s>  of a child much less </s>
<s>  because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct </s>
<s> 

elinor thought this generosity overstrained considering her sisters
youth and urged the matter farther but in vain </s>
<s>  common sense common
care common prudence were all sunk in <abvr> dashwoods romantic
delicacy </s>
<s> 

it was several days before willoughbys name was mentioned before
marianne by any of her family </s>
<s>  sir john and <abvr> jennings indeed were
not so nice </s>
<s>  their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour </s>
<s> but
one evening <abvr> dashwood accidentally taking up a volume of
shakespeare exclaimed

we have never finished hamlet marianne </s>
<s>  our dear willoughby went away
before we could get through it </s>
<s>   we will put it by that when he comes
again </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but it may be months perhaps before that happens </s>
<s> 

months </s>
<s>  cried marianne with strong surprise </s>
<s>   nonor many weeks </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was sorry for what she had said </s>
<s>  but it gave elinor
pleasure as it produced a reply from marianne so expressive of
confidence in willoughby and knowledge of his intentions </s>
<s> 

one morning about a week after his leaving the country marianne was
prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of
wandering away by herself </s>
<s>   hitherto she had carefully avoided every
companion in her rambles </s>
<s>   if her sisters intended to walk on the
downs she directly stole away towards the lanes </s>
<s>  if they talked of the
valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills and could never be
found when the others set off </s>
<s>   but at length she was secured by the
exertions of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion </s>
<s> 
they walked along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence
for mariannes mind could not be controlled and elinor satisfied with
gaining one point would not then attempt more </s>
<s>   beyond the entrance of
the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and
more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
coming to barton lay before them </s>
<s>  and on reaching that point they
stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the
distance of their view from the cottage from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before </s>
<s> 

amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered an animated one </s>
<s> 
it was a man on horseback riding towards them </s>
<s>   in a few minutes they
could distinguish him to be a gentleman </s>
<s>  and in a moment afterwards
marianne rapturously exclaimed

it is he </s>
<s>  it is indeed </s>
<s> i know it is </s>
<s> and was hastening to meet
him when elinor cried out

indeed marianne i think you are mistaken </s>
<s>   it is not willoughby </s>
<s> 
the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air </s>
<s> 

he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has </s>
<s>   his air his
coat his horse </s>
<s>   i knew how soon he would come </s>
<s> 

she walked eagerly on as she spoke </s>
<s>  and elinor to screen marianne from
particularity as she felt almost certain of its not being willoughby
quickened her pace and kept up with her </s>
<s>   they were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman </s>
<s>   marianne looked again </s>
<s>  her heart sunk within
her </s>
<s>  and abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when the voices
of both her sisters were raised to detain her </s>
<s>  a third almost as well
known as willoughbys joined them in begging her to stop and she
turned round with surprise to see and welcome edward ferrars </s>
<s> 

he was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
forgiven for not being willoughby </s>
<s>  the only one who could have gained a
smile from her </s>
<s>  but she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her
sisters happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment </s>
<s> 

he dismounted and giving his horse to his servant walked back with
them to barton whither he was purposely coming to visit them </s>
<s> 

he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality but especially by
marianne who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than
even elinor herself </s>
<s>   to marianne indeed the meeting between edward
and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour </s>
<s>   on
edwards side more particularly there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion </s>
<s>   he was confused
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them looked neither
rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by
questions and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection </s>
<s>   marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise </s>
<s>   she began almost to feel a
dislike of edward </s>
<s>  and it ended as every feeling must end with her by
carrying back her thoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect </s>
<s> 

after a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting marianne asked edward if he came directly from london </s>
<s>   no
he had been in devonshire a fortnight </s>
<s> 

a fortnight </s>
<s>  she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same
county with elinor without seeing her before </s>
<s> 

he looked rather distressed as he added that he had been staying with
some friends near plymouth </s>
<s> 

have you been lately in sussex </s>
<s>  said elinor </s>
<s> 

i was at norland about a month ago </s>
<s> 

and how does dear dear norland look </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s> 

dear dear norland said elinor probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year </s>
<s>   the woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves </s>
<s> 

oh cried marianne with what transporting sensation have i formerly
seen them fall </s>
<s>   how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven
in showers about me by the wind </s>
<s>   what feelings have they the season
the air altogether inspired </s>
<s>   now there is no one to regard them </s>
<s>   they
are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as
possible from the sight </s>
<s> 

it is not every one said elinor who has your passion for dead
leaves </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  my feelings are not often shared not often understood </s>
<s>   but
sometimes they are </s>
<s> as she said this she sunk into a reverie for a
few moments </s>
<s> but rousing herself again now edward said she
calling his attention to the prospect here is barton valley </s>
<s>   look up
to it and be tranquil if you can </s>
<s>   look at those hills </s>
<s>   did you ever
see their equals </s>
<s>   to the left is barton park amongst those woods and
plantations </s>
<s>   you may see the end of the house </s>
<s>   and there beneath
that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage </s>
<s> 

it is a beautiful country he replied </s>
<s>  but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter </s>
<s> 

how can you think of dirt with such objects before you </s>
<s> 

because replied he smiling among the rest of the objects before
me i see a very dirty lane </s>
<s> 

how strange </s>
<s>  said marianne to herself as she walked on </s>
<s> 

have you an agreeable neighbourhood here </s>
<s>   are the middletons pleasant
people </s>
<s> 

no not all answered marianne </s>
<s>  we could not be more unfortunately
situated </s>
<s> 

marianne cried her sister how can you say so </s>
<s>  how can you be so
unjust </s>
<s>   they are a very respectable family <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  and towards
us have behaved in the friendliest manner </s>
<s>   have you forgot marianne
how many pleasant days we have owed to them </s>
<s> 

no said marianne in a low voice nor how many painful moments </s>
<s> 

elinor took no notice of this </s>
<s>  and directing her attention to their
visitor endeavoured to support something like discourse with him by
talking of their present residence its conveniences &c </s>
<s>  extorting
from him occasional questions and remarks </s>
<s>   his coldness and reserve
mortified her severely </s>
<s>  she was vexed and half angry </s>
<s>  but resolving to
regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present she
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him
as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him </s>
<s>  for his
coming to barton was in her opinion of all things the most natural </s>
<s> 
her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder </s>
<s>   he received
the kindest welcome from her </s>
<s>  and shyness coldness reserve could not
stand against such a reception </s>
<s>   they had begun to fail him before he
entered the house and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her </s>
<s>  and
elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like
himself </s>
<s>   his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all and his
interest in their welfare again became perceptible </s>
<s>   he was not in
spirits however </s>
<s>  he praised their house admired its prospect was
attentive and kind </s>
<s>  but still he was not in spirits </s>
<s>   the whole family
perceived it and <abvr> dashwood attributing it to some want of
liberality in his mother sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents </s>
<s> 

what are <abvr> ferrarss views for you at present edward </s>
<s>  said she
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire </s>
<s>  are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than
inclination for a public life </s>
<s> 

but how is your fame to be established </s>
<s>  for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family </s>
<s>  and with no inclination for expense no
affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find
it a difficult matter </s>
<s> 

i shall not attempt it </s>
<s>   i have no wish to be distinguished </s>
<s>  and have
every reason to hope i never shall </s>
<s>   thank heaven </s>
<s>  i cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence </s>
<s> 

you have no ambition i well know </s>
<s>   your wishes are all moderate </s>
<s> 

as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe </s>
<s>   i wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy </s>
<s>  but like every body
else it must be in my own way </s>
<s>   greatness will not make me so </s>
<s> 

strange that it would </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s>   what have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness </s>
<s> 

grandeur has but little said elinor but wealth has much to do with
it </s>
<s> 

elinor for shame </s>
<s>  said marianne money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it </s>
<s>   beyond a competence it can
afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned </s>
<s> 

perhaps said elinor smiling we may come to the same point </s>
<s>   your
competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say </s>
<s>  and without
them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting </s>
<s>   your ideas are only more noble than
mine </s>
<s>   come what is your competence </s>
<s> 

about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year </s>
<s>  not more than that </s>
<s> 

elinor laughed </s>
<s>   two thousand a year </s>
<s>  one is my wealth </s>
<s>  i guessed how
it would end </s>
<s> 

and yet two thousand ayear is a very moderate income said marianne </s>
<s> 
a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller </s>
<s>   i am sure i am not
extravagant in my demands </s>
<s>   a proper establishment of servants a
carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less </s>
<s> 

elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at combe magna </s>
<s> 

hunters </s>
<s>  repeated edwardbut why must you have hunters </s>
<s>   every body
does not hunt </s>
<s> 

marianne coloured as she replied but most people do </s>
<s> 

i wish said margaret striking out a novel thought that somebody
would give us all a large fortune apiece </s>
<s> 

oh that they would </s>
<s>  cried marianne her eyes sparkling with
animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness </s>
<s> 

we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose said elinor in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth </s>
<s> 

oh dear </s>
<s>  cried margaret how happy i should be </s>
<s>   i wonder what i
should do with it </s>
<s> 

marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point </s>
<s> 

i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself said <abvr>
dashwood if my children were all to be rich without my help </s>
<s> 

you must begin your improvements on this house observed elinor and
your difficulties will soon vanish </s>
<s> 

what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london said
edward in such an event </s>
<s>   what a happy day for booksellers
musicsellers and printshops </s>
<s>   you miss dashwood would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent youand as
for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music
enough in london to content her </s>
<s>   and books </s>
<s> thomson cowper
scottshe would buy them all over and over again </s>
<s>  she would buy up
every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands </s>
<s> 
and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old
twisted tree </s>
<s>   should not you marianne </s>
<s>   forgive me if i am very
saucy </s>
<s>   but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our old
disputes </s>
<s> 

i love to be reminded of the past edwardwhether it be melancholy or
gay i love to recall itand you will never offend me by talking of
former times </s>
<s>   you are very right in supposing how my money would be
spentsome of it at leastmy loose cash would certainly be employed
in improving my collection of music and books </s>
<s> 

and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs </s>
<s> 

no edward i should have something else to do with it </s>
<s> 

perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their lifeyour opinion on that point is
unchanged i presume </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed </s>
<s>   it is
not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them </s>
<s> 

marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor she is not
at all altered </s>
<s> 

she is only grown a little more grave than she was </s>
<s> 

nay edward said marianne you need not reproach me </s>
<s>   you are not
very gay yourself </s>
<s> 

why should you think so </s>
<s>  replied he with a sigh </s>
<s>   but gaiety never
was a part of my character </s>
<s> 

nor do i think it a part of mariannes said elinor </s>
<s>  i should hardly
call her a lively girlshe is very earnest very eager in all she
doessometimes talks a great deal and always with animationbut she
is not often really merry </s>
<s> 

i believe you are right he replied and yet i have always set her
down as a lively girl </s>
<s> 

i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes said
elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other </s>
<s>  fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or
stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated </s>
<s>   sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge </s>
<s> 

but i thought it was right elinor said marianne to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people </s>
<s>   i thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours </s>
<s>   this has
always been your doctrine i am sure </s>
<s> 

no marianne never </s>
<s>   my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding </s>
<s>   all i have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour </s>
<s>   you must not confound my meaning </s>
<s>   i am guilty i confess
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention </s>
<s>  but when have i advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters </s>
<s> 

you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility said edward to elinor </s>
<s>   do you gain no ground </s>
<s> 

quite the contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne </s>
<s> 

my judgment he returned is all on your side of the question </s>
<s>  but i
am afraid my practice is much more on your sisters </s>
<s>   i never wish to
offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness </s>
<s>   i have frequently thought
that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility </s>
<s> 

marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers said
elinor </s>
<s> 

she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied edward </s>
<s> 
shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other </s>
<s>   if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful i should not be shy </s>
<s> 

but you would still be reserved said marianne and that is worse </s>
<s> 

edward startedreserved </s>
<s>  am i reserved marianne </s>
<s> 

yes very </s>
<s> 

i do not understand you replied he colouring </s>
<s>   reserved </s>
<s> how in
what manner </s>
<s>   what am i to tell you </s>
<s>   what can you suppose </s>
<s> 

elinor looked surprised at his emotion </s>
<s>  but trying to laugh off the
subject she said to him do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she means </s>
<s>   do not you know she calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as
rapturously as herself </s>
<s> 

edward made no answer </s>
<s>   his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him
in their fullest extentand he sat for some time silent and dull </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend </s>
<s>   his
visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction while his own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect </s>
<s>   it was evident that he was
unhappy </s>
<s>  she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished
her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of
inspiring </s>
<s>  but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very
uncertain </s>
<s>  and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one </s>
<s> 

he joined her and marianne in the breakfastroom the next morning
before the others were down </s>
<s>  and marianne who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to
themselves </s>
<s>   but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour
door open and turning round was astonished to see edward himself
come out </s>
<s> 

i am going into the village to see my horses said he as you are
not yet ready for breakfast </s>
<s>  i shall be back again presently </s>
<s> 

                    

edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country </s>
<s>  in his walk to the village he had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage </s>
<s>  and the village itself in a much higher situation
than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had
exceedingly pleased him </s>
<s>   this was a subject which ensured mariannes
attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of
these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had
particularly struck him when edward interrupted her by saying you
must not enquire too far marianneremember i have no knowledge in the
picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
if we come to particulars </s>
<s>   i shall call hills steep which ought to be
bold </s>
<s>  surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and
rugged </s>
<s>  and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere </s>
<s>   you must be
satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give </s>
<s>   i call it a
very fine countrythe hills are steep the woods seem full of fine
timber and the valley looks comfortable and snugwith rich meadows
and several neat farm houses scattered here and there </s>
<s>   it exactly
answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with
utilityand i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire
it </s>
<s>  i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey
moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me </s>
<s>   i know nothing of
the picturesque </s>
<s> 

i am afraid it is but too true said marianne </s>
<s>  but why should you
boast of it </s>
<s> 

i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation
edward here falls into another </s>
<s>   because he believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater
indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he
possesses </s>
<s>   he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own </s>
<s> 

it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon </s>
<s>   every body pretends to feel and tries to
describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was </s>
<s>   i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i
have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning </s>
<s> 

i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in
a fine prospect which you profess to feel </s>
<s>   but in return your sister
must allow me to feel no more than i profess </s>
<s>   i like a fine prospect
but not on picturesque principles </s>
<s>   i do not like crooked twisted
blasted trees </s>
<s>   i admire them much more if they are tall straight and
flourishing </s>
<s>   i do not like ruined tattered cottages </s>
<s>   i am not fond
of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms </s>
<s>   i have more pleasure in a
snug farmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy happy villages
please me better than the finest banditti in the world </s>
<s> 

marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her
sister </s>
<s>   elinor only laughed </s>
<s> 

the subject was continued no farther </s>
<s>  and marianne remained
thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly engaged her attention </s>
<s> 
she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from <abvr> dashwood
his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait
of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers </s>
<s> 

i never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried </s>
<s>   is that
fannys hair </s>
<s>  i remember her promising to give you some </s>
<s>   but i should
have thought her hair had been darker </s>
<s> 

marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really feltbut when she saw
how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought
could not be surpassed by his </s>
<s>   he coloured very deeply and giving a
momentary glance at elinor replied yes </s>
<s>  it is my sisters hair </s>
<s>   the
setting always casts a different shade on it you know </s>
<s> 

elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise </s>
<s>   that the hair
was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne </s>
<s> 
the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne
considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself </s>
<s> 
she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and
affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of
something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all
doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own </s>
<s> 

edwards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled </s>
<s>   he was particularly grave the whole morning </s>
<s> 
marianne severely censured herself for what she had said </s>
<s>  but her own
forgiveness might have been more speedy had she known how little
offence it had given her sister </s>
<s> 

before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and <abvr>
jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage came to take a survey of the guest </s>
<s>   with the assistance of
his motherinlaw sir john was not long in discovering that the name
of ferrars began with an f </s>
<s>  and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung </s>
<s>   but as it was she only learned from some very significant
looks how far their penetration founded on margarets instructions
extended </s>
<s> 

sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening </s>
<s> 
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor
towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished
to engage them for both </s>
<s> 

you must drink tea with us to night said he for we shall be quite
aloneand tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a
large party </s>

a dance </s>

who </s>

<s> 
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
nameless is gone </s>
<s> 

i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among
us again </s>
<s> 

this and mariannes blushing gave new suspicions to edward </s>

is willoughby </s>

was sitting </s>

she gave him a brief reply </s>

what do you mean </s>

certainly </s>

well then </s>

marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his manner and after a moments silence said

oh edward </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i am sure
you will like him </s>
<s> 

i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness
and warmth </s>

chapter 


edward remained a week at the cottage </s>
<s>  he was earnestly pressed by <abvr>
dashwood to stay longer </s>
<s>  but as if he were bent only on
selfmortification he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment
among his friends was at the height </s>
<s>   his spirits during the last two
or three days though still very unequal were greatly improvedhe
grew more and more partial to the house and environsnever spoke of
going away without a sighdeclared his time to be wholly
disengagedeven doubted to what place he should go when he left
thembut still go he must </s>
<s>   never had any week passed so quicklyhe
could hardly believe it to be gone </s>
<s>   he said so repeatedly </s>
<s>  other
things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the
lie to his actions </s>
<s>   he had no pleasure at norland </s>
<s>  he detested being
in town </s>
<s>  but either to norland or london he must go </s>
<s>   he valued their
kindness beyond any thing and his greatest happiness was in being with
them </s>
<s>   yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their
wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time </s>
<s> 

elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his
mothers account </s>
<s>  and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her son </s>
<s>   disappointed however
and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain
behaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regard
his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for
willoughbys service by her mother </s>
<s>   his want of spirits of openness
and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of
independence and his better knowledge of <abvr> ferrarss disposition
and designs </s>
<s>   the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose
in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same
inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother </s>
<s>   the old
wellestablished grievance of duty against will parent against child
was the cause of all </s>
<s>   she would have been glad to know when these
difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yieldwhen <abvr>
ferrars would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy </s>
<s>   but
from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
of her confidence in edwards affection to the remembrance of every
mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton and
above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round
his finger </s>
<s> 

i think edward said <abvr> dashwood as they were at breakfast the
last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions </s>
<s>   some
inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from ityou would
not be able to give them so much of your time </s>
<s>   but with a smile you
would be materially benefited in one particular at leastyou would
know where to go when you left them </s>
<s> 

i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point
as you think now </s>
<s>   it has been and is and probably will always be a
heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage
me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like
independence </s>
<s>   but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my
friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being </s>
<s>   we never
could agree in our choice of a profession </s>
<s>   i always preferred the
church as i still do </s>
<s>   but that was not smart enough for my family </s>
<s> 
they recommended the army </s>
<s>   that was a great deal too smart for me </s>
<s> 
the law was allowed to be genteel enough </s>
<s>  many young men who had
chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first
circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs </s>
<s>   but i had no
inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which
my family approved </s>
<s>   as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i
was too old when the subject was first started to enter itand at
length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all
as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as
with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous
and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so
earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
friends to do nothing </s>
<s>   i was therefore entered at oxford and have been
properly idle ever since </s>
<s> 

the consequence of which i suppose will be said <abvr> dashwood
since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will
be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades
as columellas </s>
<s> 

they will be brought up said he in a serious accent to be as
unlike myself as is possible </s>
<s>   in feeling in action in condition in
every thing </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits
edward </s>
<s>   you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike
yourself must be happy </s>
<s>   but remember that the pain of parting from
friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their
education or state </s>
<s>   know your own happiness </s>
<s>   you want nothing but
patienceor give it a more fascinating name call it hope </s>
<s>   your
mother will secure to you in time that independence you are so
anxious for </s>
<s>  it is her duty and it will it must ere long become her
happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent </s>
<s> 
how much may not a few months do </s>
<s> 

i think replied edward that i may defy many months to produce any
good to me </s>
<s> 

this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which
shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on elinors
feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue </s>
<s> 
but as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his
going away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
marianne on a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow by
seeking silence solitude and idleness </s>
<s>   their means were as different
as their objects and equally suited to the advancement of each </s>
<s> 

elinor sat down to her drawingtable as soon as he was out of the
house busily employed herself the whole day neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as
much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this
conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her account </s>
<s> 

such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no
more meritorious to marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her </s>
<s> 
the business of selfcommand she settled very easily </s>
<s> with strong
affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit </s>
<s> 
that her sisters affections were calm she dared not deny though she
blushed to acknowledge it </s>
<s>  and of the strength of her own she gave a
very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in
spite of this mortifying conviction </s>
<s> 

without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
to think of edward and of edwards behaviour in every possible
variety which the different state of her spirits at different times
could producewith tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt </s>
<s> 
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her
mother and sisters at least by the nature of their employments
conversation was forbidden among them and every effect of solitude was
produced </s>
<s>   her mind was inevitably at liberty </s>
<s>  her thoughts could not
be chained elsewhere </s>
<s>  and the past and the future on a subject so
interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross
her memory her reflection and her fancy </s>
<s> 

from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawingtable she was
roused one morning soon after edwards leaving them by the arrival of
company </s>
<s>   she happened to be quite alone </s>
<s>   the closing of the little
gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew
her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the
door </s>
<s>   amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and <abvr> jennings
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown
to her </s>
<s>   she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john
perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open
the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the
door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one
without being heard at the other </s>
<s> 

well said he we have brought you some strangers </s>
<s>   how do you like
them </s>
<s> 

hush </s>
<s>  they will hear you </s>
<s> 

never mind if they do </s>
<s>   it is only the palmers </s>
<s>   charlotte is very
pretty i can tell you </s>
<s>   you may see her if you look this way </s>
<s> 

as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without
taking that liberty she begged to be excused </s>
<s> 

where is marianne </s>
<s>  has she run away because we are come </s>
<s>  i see her
instrument is open </s>
<s> 

she is walking i believe </s>
<s> 

they were now joined by <abvr> jennings who had not patience enough to
wait till the door was opened before she told her story </s>
<s>   she came
hallooing to the window how do you do my dear </s>
<s>   how does <abvr>
dashwood do </s>
<s>   and where are your sisters </s>
<s>   what </s>
<s>  all alone </s>
<s>  you will be
glad of a little company to sit with you </s>
<s>   i have brought my other son
and daughter to see you </s>
<s>   only think of their coming so suddenly </s>
<s>   i
thought i heard a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea
but it never entered my head that it could be them </s>
<s>   i thought of
nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again </s>
<s>  so
i said to sir john i do think i hear a carriage </s>
<s>  perhaps it is colonel
brandon come back again

elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to
receive the rest of the party </s>
<s>  lady middleton introduced the two
strangers </s>
<s>  <abvr> dashwood and margaret came down stairs at the same
time and they all sat down to look at one another while <abvr> jennings
continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour
attended by sir john </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally
unlike her in every respect </s>
<s>   she was short and plump had a very
pretty face and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be </s>
<s>   her manners were by no means so elegant as her sisters
but they were much more prepossessing </s>
<s>   she came in with a smile
smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled
when she went away </s>
<s>   her husband was a grave looking young man of five
or six and twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife
but of less willingness to please or be pleased </s>
<s>   he entered the room
with a look of selfconsequence slightly bowed to the ladies without
speaking a word and after briefly surveying them and their
apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read
it as long as he staid </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a
turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her
admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  what a delightful room this is </s>
<s>  i never saw anything so
charming </s>
<s>   only think mama how it is improved since i was here last </s>
<s> 
i always thought it such a sweet place maam </s>
<s>  turning to <abvr>
dashwood but you have made it so charming </s>
<s>   only look sister how
delightful every thing is </s>
<s>  how i should like such a house for myself </s>
<s> 
should not you <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the
newspaper </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer does not hear me said she laughing </s>
<s>  he never does
sometimes </s>
<s>   it is so ridiculous </s>
<s> 

this was quite a new idea to <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>  she had never been used to
find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with
surprise at them both </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and
continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing
their friends without ceasing till every thing was told </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every
body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an
agreeable surprise </s>
<s> 

you may believe how glad we all were to see them added <abvr>
jennings leaning forward towards elinor and speaking in a low voice
as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on
different sides of the room </s>
<s>  but however i cant help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it
for they came all round by london upon account of some business for
you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was
wrong in her situation </s>
<s>   i wanted her to stay at home and rest this
morning but she would come with us </s>
<s>  she longed so much to see you all </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm </s>
<s> 

she expects to be confined in february continued <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation and
therefore exerted herself to ask <abvr> palmer if there was any news in
the paper </s>
<s> 

no none at all he replied and read on </s>
<s> 

here comes marianne cried sir john </s>
<s>   now palmer you shall see a
monstrous pretty girl </s>
<s> 

he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and
ushered her in himself </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings asked her as soon as she
appeared if she had not been to allenham </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer laughed so
heartily at the question as to show she understood it </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
looked up on her entering the room stared at her some minutes and
then returned to his newspaper </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmers eye was now caught by
the drawings which hung round the room </s>
<s>   she got up to examine them </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear how beautiful these are </s>
<s>   well </s>
<s>  how delightful </s>
<s>   do but
look mama how sweet </s>
<s>  i declare they are quite charming </s>
<s>  i could look
at them for ever </s>
<s>  and then sitting down again she very soon forgot
that there were any such things in the room </s>
<s> 

when lady middleton rose to go away <abvr> palmer rose also laid down
the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all around </s>
<s> 

my love have you been asleep </s>
<s>  said his wife laughing </s>
<s> 

he made her no answer </s>
<s>  and only observed after again examining the
room that it was very low pitched and that the ceiling was crooked </s>
<s> 
he then made his bow and departed with the rest </s>
<s> 

sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
the park </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood who did not chuse to dine with them oftener
than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account </s>
<s> 
her daughters might do as they pleased </s>
<s>   but they had no curiosity to
see how <abvr> and <abvr> palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of
pleasure from them in any other way </s>
<s>   they attempted therefore
likewise to excuse themselves </s>
<s>  the weather was uncertain and not
likely to be good </s>
<s>   but sir john would not be satisfiedthe carriage
should be sent for them and they must come </s>
<s>   lady middleton too though
she did not press their mother pressed them </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings and <abvr>
palmer joined their entreaties all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
family party </s>
<s>  and the young ladies were obliged to yield </s>
<s> 

why should they ask us </s>
<s>  said marianne as soon as they were gone </s>
<s> 
the rent of this cottage is said to be low </s>
<s>  but we have it on very
hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
either with them or with us </s>
<s> 

they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now said elinor by
these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a
few weeks ago </s>
<s>   the alteration is not in them if their parties are
grown tedious and dull </s>

chapter 


as the miss dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park the next
day at one door <abvr> palmer came running in at the other looking as
good humoured and merry as before </s>
<s>   she took them all most
affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them
again </s>
<s> 

i am so glad to see you </s>
<s>  said she seating herself between elinor and
marianne for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come
which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow </s>
<s>  we must
go for the westons come to us next week you know </s>
<s>   it was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door and then <abvr> palmer asked me if i
would go with him to barton </s>
<s>   he is so droll </s>
<s>  he never tells me any
thing </s>
<s>  i am so sorry we cannot stay longer </s>
<s>  however we shall meet again
in town very soon i hope </s>
<s> 

they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation </s>
<s> 

not go to town </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> palmer with a laugh i shall be quite
disappointed if you do not </s>
<s>   i could get the nicest house in the world for
you next door to ours in hanoversquare </s>
<s>   you must come indeed </s>
<s>   i
am sure i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till i am
confined if <abvr> dashwood should not like to go into public </s>
<s> 

they thanked her </s>
<s>  but were obliged to resist all her entreaties </s>
<s> 

oh my love cried <abvr> palmer to her husband who just then entered
the roomyou must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to
town this winter </s>
<s> 

her love made no answer </s>
<s>  and after slightly bowing to the ladies began
complaining of the weather </s>
<s> 

how horrid all this is </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>   such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting </s>
<s>   dullness is as much produced within doors as
without by rain </s>
<s>   it makes one detest all ones acquaintance </s>
<s>   what
the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his
house </s>
<s>   how few people know what comfort is </s>
<s>   sir john is as stupid as
the weather </s>
<s> 

the rest of the company soon dropt in </s>
<s> 

i am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have not been able to
take your usual walk to allenham today </s>
<s> 

marianne looked very grave and said nothing </s>
<s> 

oh dont be so sly before us said <abvr> palmer </s>
<s>  for we know all
about it i assure you </s>
<s>  and i admire your taste very much for i think
he is extremely handsome </s>
<s>   we do not live a great way from him in the
country you know </s>
<s>   not above ten miles i dare say </s>
<s> 

much nearer thirty said her husband </s>
<s> 

ah well </s>
<s>  there is not much difference </s>
<s>   i never was at his house </s>
<s>  but
they say it is a sweet pretty place </s>
<s> 

as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life said <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her
interest in what was said </s>
<s> 

is it very ugly </s>
<s>  continued <abvr> palmerthen it must be some other
place that is so pretty i suppose </s>
<s> 

when they were seated in the dining room sir john observed with regret
that they were only eight all together </s>
<s> 

my dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be
so few </s>
<s>   why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today </s>
<s> 

did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before
that it could not be done </s>
<s>   they dined with us last </s>
<s> 

you and i sir john said <abvr> jennings should not stand upon such
ceremony </s>
<s> 

then you would be very illbred cried <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> 

my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual
laugh </s>
<s>   do you know that you are quite rude </s>
<s> 

i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother
illbred </s>
<s> 

ay you may abuse me as you please said the goodnatured old lady
you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again </s>
<s> 
so there i have the whip hand of you </s>
<s> 

charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid
of her </s>
<s>  and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her
as they must live together </s>
<s>   it was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy than <abvr>
palmer </s>
<s>   the studied indifference insolence and discontent of her
husband gave her no pain </s>
<s>  and when he scolded or abused her she was
highly diverted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer is so droll </s>
<s>  said she in a whisper to elinor </s>
<s>   he is
always out of humour </s>
<s> 

elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly illnatured or illbred as he
wished to appear </s>
<s>   his temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly
womanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it </s>
<s>  it was rather a wish of
distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of
every body and his general abuse of every thing before him </s>
<s>   it was
the desire of appearing superior to other people </s>
<s>   the motive was too
common to be wondered at </s>
<s>  but the means however they might succeed by
establishing his superiority in illbreeding were not likely to attach
any one to him except his wife </s>
<s> 

oh my dear miss dashwood said <abvr> palmer soon afterwards i have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister </s>
<s>   will you come and
spend some time at cleveland this christmas </s>
<s>   now pray doand come
while the westons are with us </s>
<s>   you cannot think how happy i shall be </s>
<s> 
it will be quite delightful </s>
<s> my love applying to her husband dont
you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland </s>
<s> 

certainly he replied with a sneeri came into devonshire with no
other view </s>
<s> 

there nowsaid his lady you see <abvr> palmer expects you </s>
<s>  so you
cannot refuse to come </s>
<s> 

they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation </s>
<s> 

but indeed you must and shall come </s>
<s>   i am sure you will like it of all
things </s>
<s>   the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful </s>
<s> 
you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is </s>
<s>  and we are so gay
now for <abvr> palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election </s>
<s>  and so many people came to dine with us that i
never saw before it is quite charming </s>
<s>   but poor fellow </s>
<s>  it is very
fatiguing to him </s>
<s>  for he is forced to make every body like him </s>
<s> 

elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the
hardship of such an obligation </s>
<s> 

how charming it will be said charlotte when he is in
parliament </s>
<s> wont it </s>
<s>  how i shall laugh </s>
<s>   it will be so ridiculous to
see all his letters directed to him with an m </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> but do you know he
says he will never frank for me </s>
<s>   he declares he wont </s>
<s>   dont you
mr </s>
<s>  palmer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer took no notice of her </s>
<s> 

he cannot bear writing you know she continuedhe says it is quite
shocking </s>
<s> 

no said he i never said any thing so irrational </s>
<s>   dont palm all
your abuses of languages upon me </s>
<s> 

there now </s>
<s>  you see how droll he is </s>
<s>   this is always the way with him </s>
<s> 
sometimes he wont speak to me for half a day together and then he
comes out with something so drollall about any thing in the world </s>
<s> 

she surprised elinor very much as they returned into the drawingroom
by asking her whether she did not like <abvr> palmer excessively </s>
<s> 

certainly said elinor </s>
<s>  he seems very agreeable </s>
<s> 

welli am so glad you do </s>
<s>   i thought you would he is so pleasant </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can
tell you and you cant think how disappointed he will be if you dont
come to cleveland </s>
<s> i cant imagine why you should object to it </s>
<s> 

elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation </s>
<s>  and by changing the
subject put a stop to her entreaties </s>
<s>   she thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county <abvr> palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of willoughbys general character than could
be gathered from the middletons partial acquaintance with him </s>
<s>  and she
was eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from marianne </s>
<s>   she began by
inquiring if they saw much of <abvr> willoughby at cleveland and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him </s>
<s> 

oh dear yes </s>
<s>  i know him extremely well replied <abvr> palmer </s>
<s> not
that i ever spoke to him indeed </s>
<s>  but i have seen him for ever in town </s>
<s> 
somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was
at allenham </s>
<s>   mama saw him here once before </s>
<s> but i was with my uncle
at weymouth </s>
<s>   however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of
him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we
should never have been in the country together </s>

well </s>

my dear <abvr> palmer </s>

you surprise me very much </s>

you must be mistaken </s>

it happened </s>
<s>   when we met him he turned back and walked with us </s>

so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and

mrs </s>

chapter 


the palmers returned to cleveland the next day and the two families at
barton were again left to entertain each other </s>
<s>   but this did not last
long </s>
<s>  elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head had
hardly done wondering at charlottes being so happy without a cause at
mr </s>
<s>  palmers acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange
unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir
johns and <abvr> jenningss active zeal in the cause of society
procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe </s>
<s> 

in a mornings excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladies
whom <abvr> jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her
relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to
the park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over </s>
<s> 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an
invitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the
return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a
visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose
elegancewhose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof </s>
<s>  for
the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
nothing at all </s>
<s>   their being her relations too made it so much the
worse </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jenningss attempts at consolation were therefore
unfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not to care about
their being so fashionable </s>
<s>  because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another </s>
<s>   as it was impossible however now to prevent
their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it with
all the philosophy of a wellbred woman contenting herself with merely
giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times
every day </s>
<s> 

the young ladies arrived </s>
<s>  their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
unfashionable </s>
<s>   their dress was very smart their manners very civil
they were delighted with the house and in raptures with the furniture
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that lady
middletons good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
been an hour at the park </s>
<s>   she declared them to be very agreeable girls
indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration </s>
<s>   sir johns
confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he
set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss
steeles arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world </s>
<s>   from such commendation as this however there was not
much to be learned </s>
<s>  elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
world were to be met with in every part of england under every
possible variation of form face temper and understanding </s>
<s>   sir john
wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his
guests </s>
<s>   benevolent philanthropic man </s>
<s>   it was painful to him even to
keep a third cousin to himself </s>
<s> 

do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare you shall
comeyou cant think how you will like them </s>
<s>   lucy is monstrous
pretty and so good humoured and agreeable </s>
<s>   the children are all
hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance </s>
<s>   and they
both long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter that
you are the most beautiful creatures in the world </s>
<s>  and i have told them
it is all very true and a great deal more </s>
<s>   you will be delighted with
them i am sure </s>
<s>   they have brought the whole coach full of playthings
for the children </s>
<s>   how can you be so cross as not to come </s>
<s>   why they
are your cousins you know after a fashion </s>
<s>   you are my cousins and
they are my wifes so you must be related </s>
<s> 

but sir john could not prevail </s>
<s>   he could only obtain a promise of
their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in
amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their
attractions to the miss steeles as he had been already boasting of the
miss steeles to them </s>
<s> 

when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place they found in the appearance of the
eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible
face nothing to admire </s>
<s>  but in the other who was not more than two or
three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty </s>
<s>  her features
were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of air
which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction
to her person </s>
<s>  their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what
constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
to lady middleton </s>
<s>   with her children they were in continual raptures
extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their
whims </s>
<s>  and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of
whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing
or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her
appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight </s>
<s> 
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fond
mother though in pursuit of praise for her children the most
rapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous </s>
<s>  her demands
are exorbitant </s>
<s>  but she will swallow any thing </s>
<s>  and the excessive
affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring were
viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise or
distrust </s>
<s>   she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted </s>
<s> 
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their
workbags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and felt
no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment </s>
<s>   it suggested no other
surprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by
without claiming a share in what was passing </s>
<s> 

john is in such spirits today </s>
<s>  said she on his taking miss steeless
pocket handkerchief and throwing it out of windowhe is full of
monkey tricks </s>
<s> 

and soon afterwards on the second boys violently pinching one of the
same ladys fingers she fondly observed how playful william is </s>
<s> 

and here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressing
a little girl of three years old who had not made a noise for the last
two minutes </s>
<s>  and she is always so gentle and quietnever was there
such a quiet little thing </s>
<s> 

but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces a pin in her ladyships
head dress slightly scratching the childs neck produced from this
pattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone
by any creature professedly noisy </s>
<s>   the mothers consternation was
excessive </s>
<s>  but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles and
every thing was done by all three in so critical an emergency which
affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
sufferer </s>
<s>   she was seated in her mothers lap covered with kisses her
wound bathed with lavenderwater by one of the miss steeles who was
on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
the other </s>
<s>   with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to
cease crying </s>
<s>   she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two
brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were
ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been
successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of
screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that
it would not be rejected </s>
<s>  she was carried out of the room therefore
in her mothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys
chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
had not known for many hours </s>
<s> 

poor little creatures </s>
<s>  said miss steele as soon as they were gone </s>
<s> 
it might have been a very sad accident </s>
<s> 

yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it had been under
totally different circumstances </s>
<s>   but this is the usual way of
heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality </s>
<s> 

what a sweet woman lady middleton is </s>
<s>  said lucy steele </s>
<s> 

marianne was silent </s>
<s>  it was impossible for her to say what she did not
feel however trivial the occasion </s>
<s>  and upon elinor therefore the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell </s>
<s>   she did
her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more
warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy </s>
<s> 

and sir john too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is </s>
<s> 

here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple and just
came in without any eclat </s>
<s>   she merely observed that he was perfectly
good humoured and friendly </s>
<s> 

and what a charming little family they have </s>
<s>   i never saw such fine
children in my life </s>
<s> i declare i quite doat upon them already and
indeed i am always distractedly fond of children </s>
<s> 

i should guess so said elinor with a smile from what i have
witnessed this morning </s>
<s> 

i have a notion said lucy you think the little middletons rather
too much indulged </s>
<s>  perhaps they may be the outside of enough </s>
<s>  but it is
so natural in lady middleton </s>
<s>  and for my part i love to see children
full of life and spirits </s>
<s>  i cannot bear them if they are tame and
quiet </s>
<s> 

i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence </s>
<s> 

a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by miss
steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who now
said rather abruptly and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood </s>
<s> 
i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex </s>
<s> 

in some surprise at the familiarity of this question or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken elinor replied that she was </s>
<s> 

norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it </s>
<s>  added miss steele </s>
<s> 

we have heard sir john admire it excessively said lucy who seemed
to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister </s>
<s> 

i think every one must admire it replied elinor who ever saw the
place </s>
<s>  though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
beauties as we do </s>
<s> 

and had you a great many smart beaux there </s>
<s>   i suppose you have not so
many in this part of the world </s>
<s>  for my part i think they are a vast
addition always </s>
<s> 

but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed of her sister
that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex </s>
<s> 

nay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there ant </s>
<s>   im
sure theres a vast many smart beaux in exeter </s>
<s>  but you know how could
i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland </s>
<s>  and i was only
afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not
so many as they used to have </s>
<s>   but perhaps you young ladies may not
care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them </s>
<s> 
for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress
smart and behave civil </s>
<s>   but i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty </s>
<s> 
now theres <abvr> rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite a
beau clerk to <abvr> simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him of
a morning he is not fit to be seen </s>
<s>  i suppose your brother was quite
a beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich </s>
<s> 

upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you for i do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word </s>
<s>   but this i can say that
if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear </s>
<s>  one never thinks of married mens being beauxthey have
something else to do </s>
<s> 

lord </s>
<s>  anne cried her sister you can talk of nothing but
beaux </s>
<s> you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else </s>
<s> 
and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and the
furniture </s>
<s> 

this specimen of the miss steeles was enough </s>
<s>   the vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her no recommendation and as elinor was not
blinded by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest to her want
of real elegance and artlessness she left the house without any wish
of knowing them better </s>
<s> 

not so the miss steeles </s>
<s> they came from exeter well provided with
admiration for the use of sir john middleton his family and all his
relations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair
cousins whom they declared to be the most beautiful elegant
accomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted </s>
<s>  and to be
better acquainted therefore elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot for as sir john was entirely on the side of the miss steeles
their party would be too strong for opposition and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two
together in the same room almost every day </s>
<s>   sir john could do no more </s>
<s> 
but he did not know that any more was required </s>
<s>  to be together was in
his opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established
friends </s>
<s> 

to do him justice he did every thing in his power to promote their
unreserve by making the miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knew
or supposed of his cousins situations in the most delicate
particularsand elinor had not seen them more than twice before the
eldest of them wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to barton </s>
<s> 

twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure said
she and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome </s>
<s>   and i
hope you may have as good luck yourself soonbut perhaps you may have
a friend in the corner already </s>
<s> 

elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in
proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward than he had been
with respect to marianne </s>
<s>  indeed it was rather his favourite joke of
the two as being somewhat newer and more conjectural </s>
<s>  and since
edwards visit they had never dined together without his drinking to
her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks as to excite general attention </s>
<s>   the letter fhad been likewise
invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless
jokes that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with elinor </s>
<s> 

the miss steeles as she expected had now all the benefit of these
jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently
expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family </s>
<s>   but sir john did not sport long
with the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least as
much pleasure in telling the name as miss steele had in hearing it </s>
<s> 

his name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper </s>
<s>  but pray do
not tell it for its a great secret </s>
<s> 

ferrars </s>
<s>  repeated miss steele </s>
<s>  <abvr> ferrars is the happy man is he </s>
<s> 
what </s>
<s>  your sisterinlaws brother miss dashwood </s>
<s>  a very agreeable
young man to be sure </s>
<s>  i know him very well </s>
<s> 

how can you say so anne </s>
<s>  cried lucy who generally made an amendment
to all her sisters assertions </s>
<s>   though we have seen him once or twice
at my uncles it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well </s>
<s> 

elinor heard all this with attention and surprise </s>
<s>   and who was this
uncle </s>
<s>   where did he live </s>
<s>   how came they acquainted </s>
<s>   she wished very
much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in
it herself </s>
<s>  but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in
her life she thought <abvr> jennings deficient either in curiosity after
petty information or in a disposition to communicate it </s>
<s>   the manner
in which miss steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity </s>
<s>  for
it struck her as being rather illnatured and suggested the suspicion
of that ladys knowing or fancying herself to know something to his
disadvantage </s>
<s> but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice
was taken of <abvr> ferrarss name by miss steele when alluded to or even
openly mentioned by sir john </s>

chapter 


marianne who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference of
taste from herself was at this time particularly illdisposed from
the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles or to
encourage their advances </s>
<s>  and to the invariable coldness of her
behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of
lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her sentiments </s>
<s> 

lucy was naturally clever </s>
<s>  her remarks were often just and amusing </s>
<s>  and
as a companion for half an hour elinor frequently found her agreeable </s>
<s> 
but her powers had received no aid from education </s>
<s>  she was ignorant and
illiterate </s>
<s>  and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of
information in the most common particulars could not be concealed from
miss dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to
advantage </s>
<s>   elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable </s>
<s>  but she saw with
less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of
rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her
assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed </s>
<s>  and she could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance </s>
<s>  whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made
every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless </s>
<s> 

you will think my question an odd one i dare say said lucy to her
one day as they were walking together from the park to the
cottagebut pray are you personally acquainted with your
sisterinlaws mother <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

elinor did think the question a very odd one and her countenance
expressed it as she answered that she had never seen <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  replied lucy </s>
<s>  i wonder at that for i thought you must have
seen her at norland sometimes </s>
<s>   then perhaps you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she is </s>
<s> 

no returned elinor cautious of giving her real opinion of edwards
mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity i know nothing of her </s>
<s> 

i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a
way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke </s>
<s>  but perhaps
there may be reasonsi wish i might venture </s>
<s>  but however i hope you
will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be
impertinent </s>
<s> 

elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence </s>
<s>   it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by
saying with some hesitation

i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious </s>
<s>   i am sure i
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours </s>
<s>   and i am sure i
should not have the smallest fear of trusting you </s>
<s>  indeed i should be
very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
situation as i am </s>
<s>  but however there is no occasion to trouble you </s>
<s> 
i am sorry you do not happen to know <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment if it could
be of any use to you to know my opinion of her </s>
<s>   but really i never
understood that you were at all connected with that family and
therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry
into her character </s>
<s> 

i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it </s>
<s>   but
if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised </s>
<s>   <abvr>
ferrars is certainly nothing to me at presentbut the time may
comehow soon it will come must depend upon herselfwhen we may be
very intimately connected </s>
<s> 

she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side
glance at her companion to observe its effect on her </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elinor what do you mean </s>
<s>   are you acquainted
with <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s>   can you be </s>
<s>  and she did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sisterinlaw </s>
<s> 

no replied lucy not to <abvr> robert ferrarsi never saw him in my
life </s>
<s>  but fixing her eyes upon elinor to his eldest brother </s>
<s> 

what felt elinor at that moment </s>
<s>  astonishment that would have been as
painful as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it </s>
<s>   she turned towards lucy in silent amazement
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration </s>
<s>  and though
her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon </s>
<s> 

you may well be surprised continued lucy </s>
<s>  for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before </s>
<s>  for i dare say he never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family </s>
<s>  because it was always
meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so
by me to this hour </s>
<s>   not a soul of all my relations know of it but
anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt
the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy </s>

thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about <abvr> ferrars
must seem so odd that it ought to be explained </s>
<s>   and i do not think
mr </s>
<s>  ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you
because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your
family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as
his own sisters </s>
<s> she paused </s>
<s> 

elinor for a few moments remained silent </s>
<s>   her astonishment at what she
heard was at first too great for words </s>
<s>  but at length forcing herself
to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude may i ask
if your engagement is of long standing </s>
<s> 

we have been engaged these four years </s>
<s> 

four years </s>
<s> 

yes </s>

elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it </s>

i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the
other day </s>

your uncle </s>

yes </s>
<s>  <abvr> pratt </s>
<s>   did you never hear him talk of <abvr> pratt </s>

i think i have replied elinor with an exertion of spirits which
increased with her increase of emotion </s>
<s> 

he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near
plymouth </s>
<s>   it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and me
was often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement was
formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil </s>
<s>  but he
was almost always with us afterwards </s>
<s>   i was very unwilling to enter
into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of
his mother </s>
<s>  but i was too young and loved him too well to be so
prudent as i ought to have been </s>
<s>  though you do not know him so well

of person or name </s>

all my happiness depends </s>

it is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity that i
should never have heard him even mention your name </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  considering our situation it was not strange </s>
<s>   our first care has
been to keep the matter secret </s>
<s>  you knew nothing of me or my family
and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name

suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it </s>

she was silent </s>

instantly acknowledging the likeness </s>

i have never been able continued lucy to give him my picture in

anxious to get it </s>
<s>   but i am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity </s>
<s> 

you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly </s>
<s>   they then
proceeded a few paces in silence </s>
<s>   lucy spoke first </s>
<s> 

i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to
us not to have it reach his mother </s>
<s>  for she would never approve of it
i dare say </s>
<s>   i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding
proud woman </s>
<s> 

i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor </s>

no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on </s>
<s>   your
secret is safe with me </s>
<s>  but pardon me if i express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication </s>
<s>   you must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety </s>
<s> 

as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover
something in her countenance </s>
<s>  perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she had been saying </s>
<s>  but lucys countenance suffered no
change </s>
<s> 

i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you

<s>   i have not known you long to be
sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by
description a great while </s>

inquiries about edwards mother </s>

not a creature whose advice i can ask </s>
<s>   anne is the only person that
knows of it and she has no judgment at all </s>
<s>  indeed she does me a
great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her
betraying me </s>
<s>   she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must
perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world

mind from it altogether </s>
<s>   i only wonder that i am alive after what i

<s>   every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty </s>
<s>  and seeing him so seldomwe can hardly

here she took out her handkerchief </s>

compassionate </s>
<s> 

sometimes </s>
<s>  continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether it
would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely </s>
<s>   as
she said this she looked directly at her companion </s>
<s>   but then at
other times i have not resolution enough for it </s>

such a case miss dashwood </s>

<s> 

pardon me replied elinor startled by the question </s>

you no advice under such circumstances </s>
<s>   your own judgment must direct
you </s>

to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on both
sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other </s>

oh yes </s>

<s>   did you think he
came directly from town </s>

no replied elinor most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of lucys veracity </s>
<s>  i remember he told us that
he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth </s>

remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing
farther of those friends at his total silence with respect even to
their names </s>
<s> 

did not you think him sadly out of spirits </s>
<s>  repeated lucy </s>
<s> 

we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived </s>
<s> 

i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
matter </s>
<s>  but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than
a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected </s>
<s>  poor fellow </s>
<s> i
am afraid it is just the same with him now </s>
<s>  for he writes in wretched
spirits </s>
<s>   i heard from him just before i left exeter </s>
<s>  taking a letter
from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor </s>
<s>   you
know his hand i dare say a charming one it is </s>
<s>  but that is not
written so well as usual </s>
<s> he was tired i dare say for he had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible </s>
<s> 

elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer </s>
<s>   this
picture she had allowed herself to believe might have been
accidentally obtained </s>
<s>  it might not have been edwards gift </s>
<s>  but a
correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a
positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else </s>
<s>  for a few
moments she was almost overcomeher heart sunk within her and she
could hardly stand </s>
<s>  but exertion was indispensably necessary </s>
<s>  and she
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that
her success was speedy and for the time complete </s>
<s> 

writing to each other said lucy returning the letter into her
pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations </s>
<s>   yes i
have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even
that </s>
<s>   if he had but my picture he says he should be easy </s>
<s>   i gave him
a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and
that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture </s>
<s> 
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him </s>
<s> 

i did said elinor with a composure of voice under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt
before </s>
<s>   she was mortified shocked confounded </s>

fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the
conversation could be continued no farther </s>

however small elinors general dependence on lucys veracity might be
it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the

miss steeles as to norland and their family connections which had
often surprised her the picture the letter the ring formed
altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of
condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality
could set aside his illtreatment of herself </s>
<s> her resentment of such
behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short time
made her feel only for herself </s>

soon arose </s>

feigned a regard for her which he did not feel </s>
<s>   was his engagement to
lucy an engagement of the heart </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  whatever it might once have been
she could not believe it such at present </s>
<s>   his affection was all her
own </s>
<s>   she could not be deceived in that </s>
<s>   her mother sisters fanny
all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland </s>
<s>  it was not an
illusion of her own vanity </s>
<s>   he certainly loved her </s>
<s>   what a softener
of the heart was this persuasion </s>
<s>   how much could it not tempt her to
forgive </s>
<s>   he had been blamable highly blamable in remaining at
norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it
ought to be </s>
<s>   in that he could not be defended </s>
<s>  but if he had injured
her how much more had he injured himself </s>
<s>  if her case were pitiable
his was hopeless </s>
<s>   his imprudence had made her miserable for a while </s>
<s> 
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
otherwise </s>
<s>   she might in time regain tranquillity </s>
<s>  but he what had he
to look forward to </s>
<s>   could he ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele </s>
<s> 
could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his
integrity his delicacy and wellinformed mind be satisfied with a
wife like herilliterate artful and selfish </s>
<s> 

the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every
thing but her beauty and good nature </s>
<s>  but the four succeeding
yearsyears which if rationally spent give such improvement to the
understanding must have opened his eyes to her defects of education
while the same period of time spent on her side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty </s>
<s> 

if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties
from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely
to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself </s>
<s>   these
difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not
press very hard upon his patience </s>
<s>  but melancholy was the state of the
person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness
could be felt as a relief </s>
<s> 

as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept
for him more than for herself </s>
<s>   supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her present unhappiness and consoled by the
belief that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought
she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother
and sisters </s>
<s>   and so well was she able to answer her own expectations
that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first
suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object
of her love and that marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly
possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house </s>
<s> 

the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing
exertion was no aggravation of elinors distress </s>
<s>   on the contrary it
was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of edward which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt
equal to support </s>
<s> 

from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive
no assistance their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress
while her selfcommand would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise </s>
<s>   she was stronger alone and her own
good sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken
her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so
poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be </s>
<s> 

much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the
subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it </s>
<s>  and this for
more reasons than one </s>
<s>   she wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what
lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her
declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to
convince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her
calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary
agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least
doubtful </s>
<s>   that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
probable </s>
<s>  it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in her
praise not merely from lucys assertion but from her venturing to
trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important </s>
<s>   and even sir johns joking
intelligence must have had some weight </s>
<s>   but indeed while elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that lucy should be jealous </s>
<s>  and that she was so her very
confidence was a proof </s>
<s>   what other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be but that elinor might be informed by it of
lucys superior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him in future </s>
<s> 
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals
intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every
principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection
for edward and to see him as little as possible </s>
<s>  she could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was
unwounded </s>
<s>   and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure </s>
<s> 

but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred </s>
<s>  for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others </s>
<s>  and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage and chiefly at
the former they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation </s>
<s>   such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady
middletons head </s>
<s>  and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
a general chat and none at all for particular discourse </s>
<s>   they met for
the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards
or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy </s>
<s> 

one or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affording
elinor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at
the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they
would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged to
attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be quite alone
except her mother and the two miss steeles </s>
<s>   elinor who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this
was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and wellbred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united
them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the
invitation </s>
<s>  margaret with her mothers permission was equally
compliant and marianne though always unwilling to join any of their
parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her
seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise </s>
<s> 

the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her </s>
<s>   the insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as elinor had expected </s>
<s>  it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room </s>
<s>  to the latter the children accompanied them and while
they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging lucys attention to attempt it </s>
<s>   they quitted it only with the
removal of the teathings </s>
<s>   the cardtable was then placed and elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park </s>
<s>   they all rose up in
preparation for a round game </s>
<s> 

i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to finish
poor little annamarias basket this evening </s>
<s>  for i am sure it must hurt
your eyes to work filigree by candlelight </s>
<s>   and we will make the dear
little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then i
hope she will not much mind it </s>
<s> 

this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly and replied
indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton </s>
<s>  i am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have
been at my filigree already </s>
<s>   i would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world </s>
<s>  and if you want me at the cardtable now i am
resolved to finish the basket after supper </s>
<s> 

you are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyeswill you ring the
bell for some working candles </s>
<s>   my poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for
though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon
having it done </s>
<s> 

lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an
alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no
greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child </s>
<s> 

lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others </s>
<s>   no one made
any objection but marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms
of general civility exclaimed your ladyship will have the goodness
to excuse meyou know i detest cards </s>
<s>   i shall go to the pianoforte </s>
<s> 
i have not touched it since it was tuned </s>
<s>   and without farther
ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument </s>
<s> 

lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made
so rude a speech </s>
<s> 

marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know maam
said elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence </s>
<s>  and i do not
much wonder at it </s>
<s>  for it is the very best toned pianoforte i ever
heard </s>
<s> 

the remaining five were now to draw their cards </s>
<s> 

perhaps continued elinor if i should happen to cut out i may be
of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her </s>
<s>  and
there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be
impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening </s>
<s>   i
should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it </s>
<s> 

indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucy
for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was </s>
<s> 
and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after
all </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  that would be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little
soul how i do love her </s>
<s> 

you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor </s>
<s>  and as you really
like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber or will you take your chance now </s>
<s> 

elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a
little of that address which marianne could never condescend to
practise gained her own end and pleased lady middleton at the same
time </s>
<s>   lucy made room for her with ready attention and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table and with the
utmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work </s>
<s>   the pianoforte at
which marianne wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself
was luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might
safely under the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting
subject without any risk of being heard at the cardtable </s>

i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with

subject </s>
<s>   i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again </s>
<s> 

thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking the ice </s>
<s>  you have set my
heart at ease by it </s>
<s>  for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended
you by what i told you that monday </s>
<s> 

offended me </s>
<s>  how could you suppose so </s>
<s>  believe me and elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea </s>
<s>   could you have a motive for
the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me </s>
<s> 

and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sharp eyes full of
meaning there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
manner that made me quite uncomfortable </s>
<s>   i felt sure that you was
angry with me </s>
<s>  and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for
having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs </s>
<s>   but i am
very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not
blame me </s>
<s>   if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of
my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am
sure </s>
<s> 

indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you
to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall
never have reason to repent it </s>
<s>   your case is a very unfortunate one </s>
<s> 
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have
need of all your mutual affection to support you under them </s>

ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother </s>
<s> 

he has only two thousand pounds of his own </s>
<s>  it would be madness to
marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect
of more without a sigh </s>
<s>   i have been always used to a very small
income and could struggle with any poverty for him </s>
<s>  but i love him too
well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his
mother might give him if he married to please her </s>
<s>   we must wait it
may be for many years </s>
<s>   with almost every other man in the world it
would be an alarming prospect </s>
<s>  but edwards affection and constancy
nothing can deprive me of i know </s>
<s> 

that conviction must be every thing to you </s>
<s>  and he is undoubtedly
supported by the same trust in yours </s>
<s>   if the strength of your
reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under
many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement
your situation would have been pitiable indeed </s>
<s> 

lucy here looked up </s>
<s>  but elinor was careful in guarding her countenance
from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency </s>
<s> 

edwards love for me said lucy has been pretty well put to the
test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and
it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt
it now </s>
<s>   i can safely say that he has never gave me one moments alarm
on that account from the first </s>
<s> 

elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion </s>
<s> 

lucy went on </s>
<s>   i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from
our different situations in life from his being so much more in the
world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for
suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any
lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked
more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at
longstaple than he used to be </s>
<s>   i do not mean to say that i am
particularly observant or quicksighted in general but in such a case
i am sure i could not be deceived </s>
<s> 

all this thought elinor is very pretty </s>
<s>  but it can impose upon
neither of us </s>
<s> 

but what said she after a short silence are your views </s>
<s>  or have
you none but that of waiting for <abvr> ferrarss death which is a
melancholy and shocking extremity </s>
<s> is her son determined to submit to
this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which
it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a
while by owning the truth </s>
<s> 

if we could be certain that it would be only for a while </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger
upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and
the idea of that for edwards sake frightens away all my inclination
for hasty measures </s>
<s> 

and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness
beyond reason </s>
<s> 

lucy looked at elinor again and was silent </s>
<s> 

do you know <abvr> robert ferrars </s>

not at alli never saw him </s>

words by a sudden pause in mariannes music </s>
<s>  oh they are talking of

<s> 

no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beaux
are not great coxcombs </s>
<s> 

i can answer for it that miss dashwoods is not said <abvr> jennings

<s>  for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved
young men i ever saw </s>
<s>  but as for lucy she is such a sly little
creature there is no finding out who she likes </s>

oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i dare
say lucys beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss
dashwoods </s>
<s> 

elinor blushed in spite of herself </s>
<s>   lucy bit her lip and looked
angrily at her sister </s>
<s>   a mutual silence took place for some time </s>
<s> 
lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marianne
was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto

i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
head for bringing matters to bear </s>
<s>  indeed i am bound to let you into
the secret for you are a party concerned </s>
<s>   i dare say you have seen
enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other
profession </s>

can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind
enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard
to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living </s>
<s> 
which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not
likely to live a great while </s>
<s>   that would be enough for us to marry
upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest </s>
<s> 

i should always be happy replied elinor to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for <abvr> ferrars </s>

interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary </s>

orders </s>
<s> 

then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little </s>
<s> 

they were again silent for many minutes </s>
<s>   at length lucy exclaimed with
a deep sigh

i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
once by dissolving the engagement </s>
<s>   we seem so beset with difficulties
on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we
should be happier perhaps in the end </s>
<s>   but you will not give me your
advice miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

no answered elinor with a smile which concealed very agitated
feelings on such a subject i certainly will not </s>
<s>   you know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the
side of your wishes </s>
<s> 

indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great solemnity </s>
<s>  i know
nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours </s>
<s>  and i do
really believe that if you was to say to me i advise you by all
means to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars it will be
more for the happiness of both of you i should resolve upon doing it
immediately </s>
<s> 

elinor blushed for the insincerity of edwards future wife and
replied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
opinion on the subject had i formed one </s>
<s>   it raises my influence much
too high </s>
<s>  the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
much for an indifferent person </s>
<s> 

tis because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some
pique and laying a particular stress on those words that your
judgment might justly have such weight with me </s>
<s>   if you could be
supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion
would not be worth having </s>
<s> 

elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve </s>
<s>  and
was even partly determined never to mention the subject again </s>
<s>   another
pause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech and
lucy was still the first to end it </s>
<s> 

shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood </s>
<s>  said she with all
her accustomary complacency </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s> 

i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at
the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
there </s>
<s>   but i dare say you will go for all that </s>
<s>   to be sure your
brother and sister will ask you to come to them </s>
<s> 

it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do </s>
<s> 

how unlucky that is </s>
<s>  i had quite depended upon meeting you there </s>
<s> 
anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who
have been wanting us to visit them these several years </s>
<s>   but i only go
for the sake of seeing edward </s>
<s>   he will be there in february otherwise
london would have no charms for me </s>
<s>  i have not spirits for it </s>
<s> 

elinor was soon called to the cardtable by the conclusion of the first
rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for
nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
less than they had done before </s>
<s>  and elinor sat down to the card table
with the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without
affection for the person who was to be his wife </s>
<s>  but that he had not
even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere
affection on her side would have given for selfinterest alone could
induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed so
thoroughly aware that he was weary </s>
<s> 

from this time the subject was never revived by elinor and when
entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it
and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness
whenever she received a letter from edward it was treated by the
former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility
would allow </s>
<s>  for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself </s>
<s> 

the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyond
what the first invitation implied </s>
<s>   their favour increased </s>
<s>  they could
not be spared </s>
<s>  sir john would not hear of their going </s>
<s>  and in spite of
their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter in spite of the
absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was
in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay
nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration of
that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private
balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance </s>

chapter 


though <abvr> jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her children and friends she was not without
a settled habitation of her own </s>
<s>   since the death of her husband who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town she had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portman
square </s>
<s>   towards this home she began on the approach of january to
turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very
unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses dashwood to accompany her </s>
<s> 
elinor without observing the varying complexion of her sister and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations </s>
<s>   the reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings received the refusal with some surprise and
repeated her invitation immediately </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg
you will favour me with your company for ive quite set my heart upon
it </s>
<s>   dont fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i shant
put myself at all out of my way for you </s>
<s>   it will only be sending betty
by the coach and i hope i can afford that </s>
<s>   we three shall be able to
go very well in my chaise </s>
<s>  and when we are in town if you do not like
to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my
daughters </s>
<s>   i am sure your mother will not object to it </s>
<s>  for i have had
such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will
think me a very fit person to have the charge of you </s>
<s>  and if i dont
get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it
shall not be my fault </s>
<s>   i shall speak a good word for you to all the
young men you may depend upon it </s>
<s> 

i have a notion said sir john that miss marianne would not object
to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it </s>
<s>   it is very
hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss
dashwood does not wish it </s>
<s>   so i would advise you two to set off for
town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss
dashwood about it </s>
<s> 

nay cried <abvr> jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of
miss mariannes company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the
more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for
them to be together </s>
<s>  because if they got tired of me they might talk
to one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back </s>
<s>   but one or
the other if not both of them i must have </s>
<s>   lord bless me </s>
<s>  how do you
think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till
this winter to have charlotte with me </s>
<s>   come miss marianne let us
strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her
mind by and bye why so much the better </s>
<s> 

i thank you maam sincerely thank you said marianne with warmth </s>
<s> 
your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give
me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of
to be able to accept it </s>
<s>   but my mother my dearest kindest motheri
feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made
less happy less comfortable by our absenceoh </s>
<s>  no nothing should
tempt me to leave her </s>
<s>   it should not must not be a struggle </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings repeated her assurance that <abvr> dashwood could spare
them perfectly well </s>
<s>  and elinor who now understood her sister and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her
eagerness to be with willoughby again made no farther direct
opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mothers
decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any
support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not
approve of for marianne and which on her own account she had
particular reasons to avoid </s>
<s>   whatever marianne was desirous of her
mother would be eager to promoteshe could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had
never been able to inspire her with distrust </s>
<s>  and she dared not explain
the motive of her own disinclination for going to london </s>
<s>   that
marianne fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with <abvr>
jennings manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object
was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object
to her as elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to
witness </s>
<s> 

on being informed of the invitation <abvr> dashwood persuaded that such
an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her
daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to
herself how much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear of
their declining the offer upon her account </s>
<s>  insisted on their both
accepting it directly </s>
<s>  and then began to foresee with her usual
cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all
from this separation </s>
<s> 

i am delighted with the plan she cried it is exactly what i could
wish </s>
<s>   margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves </s>
<s> 
when you and the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music </s>
<s>  you will find margaret
so improved when you come back again </s>
<s>   i have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one </s>
<s>   it is very right that you should go to
town </s>
<s>  i would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of london </s>
<s>   you will be
under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to
you i can have no doubt </s>
<s>   and in all probability you will see your
brother and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife
when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so wholly
estranged from each other </s>
<s> 

though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said elinor you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion
cannot be so easily removed </s>
<s> 

mariannes countenance sunk </s>
<s> 

and what said <abvr> dashwood is my dear prudent elinor going to
suggest </s>
<s>   what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward </s>
<s>   do let
me hear a word about the expense of it </s>
<s> 

my objection is this </s>
<s>  though i think very well of <abvr> jenningss
heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or
whose protection will give us consequence </s>
<s> 

that is very true replied her mother but of her society
separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing
at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady
middleton </s>
<s> 

if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of <abvr> jennings said
marianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation </s>
<s>   i
have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort </s>
<s> 

elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty in
persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness </s>
<s>  and resolved
within herself that if her sister persisted in going she would go
likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her own judgment or that <abvr> jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of her
domestic hours </s>
<s>   to this determination she was the more easily
reconciled by recollecting that edward ferrars by lucys account was
not to be in town before february </s>
<s>  and that their visit without any
unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished </s>
<s> 

i will have you both go said <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>  these objections are
nonsensical </s>
<s>   you will have much pleasure in being in london and
especially in being together </s>
<s>  and if elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of
sources </s>
<s>  she would perhaps expect some from improving her
acquaintance with her sisterinlaws family </s>
<s> 

elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her
mothers dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this
attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin
her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars
very much and shall always be glad to see him </s>
<s>  but as to the rest of
the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am
ever known to them or not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood smiled and said nothing </s>
<s>   marianne lifted up her eyes in
astonishment and elinor conjectured that she might as well have held
her tongue </s>
<s> 

after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness
and care </s>
<s>  nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her </s>
<s>   sir john was
delighted </s>
<s>  for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in
london was something </s>
<s>   even lady middleton took the trouble of being
delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way </s>
<s>  and as for
the miss steeles especially lucy they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them </s>
<s> 

elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with
less reluctance than she had expected to feel </s>
<s>   with regard to herself
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not and
when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her
sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to all
her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety she
could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence </s>
<s> 

mariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness so great was the
perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone </s>
<s>   her
unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness </s>
<s> 
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive </s>
<s> 
her mothers affliction was hardly less and elinor was the only one of
the three who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal </s>
<s> 

their departure took place in the first week in january </s>
<s>   the
middletons were to follow in about a week </s>
<s>   the miss steeles kept their
station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the
family </s>

chapter 


elinor could not find herself in the carriage with <abvr> jennings and
beginning a journey to london under her protection and as her guest
without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure
only a few days before </s>
<s>  but these objections had all with that happy
ardour of youth which marianne and her mother equally shared been
overcome or overlooked </s>
<s>  and elinor in spite of every occasional doubt
of willoughbys constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless
her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would
engage in the solicitude of mariannes situation to have the same
animating object in view the same possibility of hope </s>
<s>   a short a
very short time however must now decide what willoughbys intentions
were </s>
<s>  in all probability he was already in town </s>
<s>   mariannes eagerness
to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there </s>
<s>  and elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character
which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her
but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such
zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant
before many meetings had taken place </s>
<s>   should the result of her
observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her sister </s>
<s>  should it be otherwise her exertions would be
of a different natureshe must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction
in the happiness of marianne </s>
<s> 

they were three days on their journey and mariannes behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to <abvr> jennings might be expected to be </s>
<s>   she sat in
silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her sister </s>
<s>   to atone for this conduct therefore elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had
assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to <abvr> jennings
talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she
could </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings on her side treated them both with all
possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets </s>
<s>   they reached town by
three oclock the third day glad to be released after such a journey
from the confinement of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire </s>
<s> 

the house was handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies
were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment </s>
<s>   it
had formerly been charlottes and over the mantelpiece still hung a
landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having
spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect </s>
<s> 

as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her
mother and sat down for that purpose </s>
<s>   in a few moments marianne did
the same </s>
<s>   i am writing home marianne said elinor </s>
<s>  had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two </s>
<s> 

i am not going to write to my mother replied marianne hastily and
as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry </s>
<s>   elinor said no more </s>
<s>  it
immediately struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby </s>
<s>  and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair they must be
engaged </s>
<s>   this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her
pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity </s>
<s> 
mariannes was finished in a very few minutes </s>
<s>  in length it could be no
more than a note </s>
<s>  it was then folded up sealed and directed with
eager rapidity </s>
<s>   elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in the
direction </s>
<s>  and no sooner was it complete than marianne ringing the
bell requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her to the twopenny post </s>
<s>   this decided the matter at once </s>
<s> 

her spirits still continued very high </s>
<s>  but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on </s>
<s>   she could scarcely eat any
dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage </s>
<s> 

it was a great satisfaction to elinor that <abvr> jennings by being much
engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing </s>
<s>   the tea
things were brought in and already had marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house elinor
felt secure of its announcing willoughbys approach and marianne
starting up moved towards the door </s>
<s>   every thing was silent </s>
<s>  this
could not be borne many seconds </s>
<s>  she opened the door advanced a few
steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned
into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him would naturally produce </s>
<s>  in the ecstasy of her feelings at that
instant she could not help exclaiming oh elinor it is willoughby
indeed it is </s>
<s>  and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms
when colonel brandon appeared </s>
<s> 

it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness and she immediately
left the room </s>
<s>   elinor was disappointed too </s>
<s>  but at the same time her
regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her </s>
<s>  and she felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive
that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him </s>
<s>   she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even
observed marianne as she quitted the room with such astonishment and
concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself </s>
<s> 

is your sister ill </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of
headaches low spirits and over fatigues </s>
<s>  and of every thing to which
she could decently attribute her sisters behaviour </s>
<s> 

he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect
himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of
his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about
their journey and the friends they had left behind </s>
<s> 

in this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side
they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere </s>
<s>   elinor wished very much to ask whether
willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by
any enquiry after his rival </s>
<s>  and at length by way of saying something
she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last </s>
<s> 
yes he replied with some embarrassment almost ever since </s>
<s>  i have
been once or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never been in
my power to return to barton </s>
<s> 

this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to
her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to <abvr> jennings and she
was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the
subject than she had ever felt </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings soon came in </s>
<s>   oh </s>

noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad to see yousorry i could not

<s>   well colonel i have brought two

<s>   but colonel where have you
been to since we parted </s>
<s>   and how does your business go on </s>
<s>   come
come lets have no secrets among friends </s>
<s> 

he replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries but
without satisfying her in any </s>
<s>   elinor now began to make the tea and
marianne was obliged to appear again </s>
<s> 

after her entrance colonel brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he had been before and <abvr> jennings could not prevail on him to
stay long </s>
<s>   no other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed </s>
<s> 

marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks </s>
<s> 
the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day </s>
<s>   they had not long finished
their breakfast before <abvr> palmers barouche stopped at the door and
in a few minutes she came laughing into the room </s>
<s>  so delighted to see
them all that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure
from meeting her mother or the miss dashwoods again </s>
<s>   so surprised at
their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected all
along </s>
<s>  so angry at their accepting her mothers invitation after having
declined her own though at the same time she would never have forgiven
them if they had not come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  palmer will be so happy to see you said she </s>
<s>  what do you think
he said when he heard of your coming with mama </s>
<s>   i forget what it was
now but it was something so droll </s>
<s> 

after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat
or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on <abvr> jenningss side and in laughter without cause on
mrs </s>
<s>  palmers it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to
which <abvr> jennings and elinor readily consented as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves </s>
<s>  and marianne though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise </s>
<s> 

wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch </s>
<s>   in bond
street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in
constant inquiry </s>
<s>  and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind
was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them from all
that interested and occupied the others </s>
<s>   restless and dissatisfied
every where her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article
of purchase however it might equally concern them both </s>
<s>  she received
no pleasure from anything </s>
<s>  was only impatient to be at home again and
could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of <abvr>
palmer whose eye was caught by every thing pretty expensive or new </s>
<s> 
who was wild to buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her
time in rapture and indecision </s>
<s> 

it was late in the morning before they returned home </s>
<s>  and no sooner had
they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when
elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there </s>
<s> 

has no letter been left here for me since we went out </s>
<s>  said she to
the footman who then entered with the parcels </s>
<s>   she was answered in the
negative </s>
<s>   are you quite sure of it </s>
<s>  she replied </s>
<s>   are you certain
that no servant no porter has left any letter or note </s>
<s> 

the man replied that none had </s>
<s> 

how very odd </s>
<s>  said she in a low and disappointed voice as she
turned away to the window </s>
<s> 

how odd indeed </s>
<s>  repeated elinor within herself regarding her sister
with uneasiness </s>
<s>   if she had not known him to be in town she would not
have written to him as she did </s>
<s>  she would have written to combe magna </s>
<s> 
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in
so doubtful so mysterious a manner </s>
<s>   i long to inquire </s>
<s>  and how will
my interference be borne </s>
<s> 

she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued
many days longer as unpleasant as they now were she would represent in
the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious
enquiry into the affair </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer and two elderly ladies of <abvr> jenningss intimate
acquaintance whom she had met and invited in the morning dined with
them </s>
<s>   the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening
engagements </s>
<s>  and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others </s>
<s>   marianne was of no use on these occasions as she
would never learn the game </s>
<s>  but though her time was therefore at her

chapter 


if this open weather holds much longer said <abvr> jennings when they
met at breakfast the following morning sir john will not like leaving
barton next week </s>
<s>  tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a days
pleasure </s>
<s>   poor souls </s>
<s>   i always pity them when they do </s>
<s>  they seem to
take it so much to heart </s>
<s> 

that is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice and walking to the
window as she spoke to examine the day </s>
<s>   i had not thought of that </s>
<s> 
this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country </s>
<s> 

it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it </s>
<s> 
it is charming weather for them indeed she continued as she sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance </s>
<s>   how much they
must enjoy it </s>
<s>  but with a little return of anxiety it cannot be
expected to last long </s>
<s>   at this time of the year and after such a
series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it </s>
<s>   frosts
will soon set in and in all probability with severity </s>
<s>   in another day
or two perhaps </s>
<s>  this extreme mildness can hardly last longernay
perhaps it may freeze tonight </s>
<s> 

at any rate said elinor wishing to prevent <abvr> jennings from
seeing her sisters thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we
shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week </s>
<s> 

ay my dear ill warrant you we do </s>
<s>   mary always has her own way </s>
<s> 

and now silently conjectured elinor she will write to combe by
this days post </s>
<s> 

but if she did the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact </s>
<s>   whatever the
truth of it might be and far as elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it yet while she saw marianne in spirits she could
not be very uncomfortable herself </s>
<s>   and marianne was in spirits </s>
<s>  happy
in the mildness of the weather and still happier in her expectation of
a frost </s>
<s> 

the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of <abvr>
jenningss acquaintance to inform them of her being in town </s>
<s>  and
marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air </s>
<s> 

dont you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor </s>
<s>  there
seems to me a very decided difference </s>
<s>   i can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff </s>
<s>   it was not so yesterday i think </s>
<s>   the clouds seem
parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear
afternoon </s>
<s> 

elinor was alternately diverted and pained </s>
<s>  but marianne persevered
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching
frost </s>
<s> 

the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with <abvr>
jenningss style of living and set of acquaintance than with her
behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind </s>
<s>   every thing in her
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and
excepting a few old city friends whom to lady middletons regret she
had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her young companions </s>
<s>   pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had
expected elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or
abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon who had a general invitation to the house was with
them almost every day </s>
<s>  he came to look at marianne and talk to elinor
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from
any other daily occurrence but who saw at the same time with much
concern his continued regard for her sister </s>
<s>   she feared it was a
strengthening regard </s>
<s>   it grieved her to see the earnestness with which
he often watched marianne and his spirits were certainly worse than
when at barton </s>
<s> 

about a week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was
also arrived </s>
<s>   his card was on the table when they came in from the
mornings drive </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  cried marianne he has been here while we were out </s>
<s> 
elinor rejoiced to be assured of his being in london now ventured to
say depend upon it he will call again tomorrow </s>
<s>   but marianne
seemed hardly to hear her and on <abvr> jenningss entrance escaped with
the precious card </s>
<s> 

this event while it raised the spirits of elinor restored to those of
her sister all and more than all their former agitation </s>
<s>   from this
moment her mind was never quiet </s>
<s>  the expectation of seeing him every
hour of the day made her unfit for any thing </s>
<s>   she insisted on being
left behind the next morning when the others went out </s>
<s> 

elinors thoughts were full of what might be passing in berkeley street
during their absence </s>
<s>  but a moments glance at her sister when they
returned was enough to inform her that willoughby had paid no second
visit there </s>
<s>   a note was just then brought in and laid on the table </s>
<s> 

for me </s>
<s>  cried marianne stepping hastily forward </s>
<s> 

no maam for my mistress </s>
<s> 

but marianne not convinced took it instantly up </s>
<s> 

it is indeed for <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  how provoking </s>
<s> 

you are expecting a letter then </s>
<s>  said elinor unable to be longer
silent </s>
<s> 

yes a littlenot much </s>
<s> 

after a short pause </s>
<s>   you have no confidence in me marianne </s>
<s> 

nay elinor this reproach from youyou who have confidence in no
one </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  returned elinor in some confusion </s>
<s>  indeed marianne i have
nothing to tell </s>
<s> 

nor i answered marianne with energy our situations then are alike </s>
<s> 
we have neither of us any thing to tell </s>
<s>  you because you do not
communicate and i because i conceal nothing </s>
<s> 

elinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself which she was
not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstances to
press for greater openness in marianne </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings soon appeared and the note being given her she read it
aloud </s>
<s>   it was from lady middleton announcing their arrival in conduit
street the night before and requesting the company of her mother and
cousins the following evening </s>
<s>   business on sir johns part and a
violent cold on her own prevented their calling in berkeley street </s>
<s> 
the invitation was accepted </s>
<s>  but when the hour of appointment drew
near necessary as it was in common civility to <abvr> jennings that
they should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her sister to go for still she had seen nothing of
willoughby </s>
<s>  and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad
than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence </s>
<s> 

elinor found when the evening was over that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode for although scarcely settled
in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty
young people and to amuse them with a ball </s>
<s>   this was an affair
however of which lady middleton did not approve </s>
<s>   in the country an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable </s>
<s>  but in london where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it
known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple with two violins and a mere sideboard collation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer were of the party </s>
<s>  from the former whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town as he was careful to avoid
the appearance of any attention to his motherinlaw and therefore
never came near her they received no mark of recognition on their
entrance </s>
<s>   he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they
were and merely nodded to <abvr> jennings from the other side of the
room </s>
<s>   marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered </s>
<s>  it
was enoughhe was not thereand she sat down equally illdisposed to
receive or communicate pleasure </s>
<s>   after they had been assembled about
an hour <abvr> palmer sauntered towards the miss dashwoods to express his
surprise on seeing them in town though colonel brandon had been first
informed of their arrival at his house and he had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come </s>
<s> 

i thought you were both in devonshire said he </s>
<s> 

did you </s>
<s>  replied elinor </s>
<s> 

when do you go back again </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  and thus ended their discourse </s>
<s> 

never had marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life as she was
that evening and never so much fatigued by the exercise </s>
<s>   she
complained of it as they returned to berkeley street </s>
<s> 

aye aye said <abvr> jennings we know the reason of all that very
well </s>
<s>  if a certain person who shall be nameless had been there you
would not have been a bit tired </s>
<s>  and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited </s>
<s> 

invited </s>
<s>  cried marianne </s>
<s> 

so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him
somewhere in the street this morning </s>
<s>  marianne said no more but
looked exceedingly hurt </s>
<s>   impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her sisters relief elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her mother and hoped by awakening her fears
for the health of marianne to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed </s>
<s>  and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne was again
writing to willoughby for she could not suppose it to be to any other
person </s>
<s> 

about the middle of the day <abvr> jennings went out by herself on
business and elinor began her letter directly while marianne too
restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one
window to the other or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation </s>
<s> 
elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother relating all
that had passed her suspicions of willoughbys inconstancy urging her
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account
of her real situation with respect to him </s>
<s> 

her letter was scarcely finished when a rap foretold a visitor and
colonel brandon was announced </s>
<s>   marianne who had seen him from the
window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he
entered it </s>
<s>   he looked more than usually grave and though expressing
satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he had somewhat in
particular to tell her sat for some time without saying a word </s>
<s> 
elinor persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her
sister was concerned impatiently expected its opening </s>
<s>   it was not the
first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction </s>
<s>  for more than
once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks
unwell today or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared
on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something
particular about her </s>
<s>   after a pause of several minutes their silence
was broken by his asking her in a voice of some agitation when he was
to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother </s>
<s>   elinor was not
prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant </s>
<s>   he
tried to smile as he replied your sisters engagement to <abvr>
willoughby is very generally known </s>
<s> 

it cannot be generally known returned elinor for her own family do
not know it </s>
<s> 

he looked surprised and said i beg your pardon i am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent </s>
<s>  but i had not supposed any secrecy
intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally
talked of </s>
<s> 

how can that be </s>
<s>  by whom can you have heard it mentioned </s>
<s> 

by manyby some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are
most intimate <abvr> jennings <abvr> palmer and the middletons </s>
<s>   but
still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to
support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today
accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to <abvr> willoughby in
your sisters writing </s>
<s>   i came to inquire but i was convinced before i
could ask the question </s>
<s>   is every thing finally settled </s>
<s>   is it
impossible to </s>
<s>   but i have no right and i could have no chance of
succeeding </s>
<s>   excuse me miss dashwood </s>
<s>   i believe i have been wrong in
saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i
have the strongest dependence </s>
<s>   tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if
concealment be possible is all that remains </s>
<s> 

these words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal of his love for
her sister affected her very much </s>
<s>   she was not immediately able to
say anything and even when her spirits were recovered she debated for
a short time on the answer it would be most proper to give </s>
<s>   the real
state of things between willoughby and her sister was so little known
to herself that in endeavouring to explain it she might be as liable
to say too much as too little </s>
<s>   yet as she was convinced that
mariannes affection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel
brandons success whatever the event of that affection might be and
at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure she thought
it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than
she really knew or believed </s>
<s>   she acknowledged therefore that though
she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
stood with each other of their mutual affection she had no doubt and
of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear </s>
<s> 

he listened to her with silent attention and on her ceasing to speak
rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion
to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness </s>
<s>  to willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve hertook leave and went away </s>
<s> 

elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation to
lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points </s>
<s>  she was left on the
contrary with a melancholy impression of colonel brandons
unhappiness and was prevented even from wishing it removed by her
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it </s>

chapter 


nothing occurred during the next three or four days to make elinor
regret what she had done in applying to her mother </s>
<s>  for willoughby
neither came nor wrote </s>
<s>   they were engaged about the end of that time
to attend lady middleton to a party from which <abvr> jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter </s>
<s>  and for this party
marianne wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming
equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure </s>
<s>   she sat by the
drawingroom fire after tea till the moment of lady middletons
arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude
lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her sisters presence </s>
<s>  and
when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the
door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected </s>
<s> 

they arrived in due time at the place of destination and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow alighted ascended the
stairs heard their names announced from one landingplace to another
in an audible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up quite full
of company and insufferably hot </s>
<s>   when they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience to which their arrival must necessarily add </s>
<s>   after some
time spent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat down to
cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for moving about she and
elinor luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great
distance from the table </s>
<s> 

they had not remained in this manner long before elinor perceived
willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman </s>
<s>   she soon
caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to
speak to her or to approach marianne though he could not but see her </s>
<s> 
and then continued his discourse with the same lady </s>
<s>   elinor turned
involuntarily to marianne to see whether it could be unobserved by
her </s>
<s>   at that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him
instantly had not her sister caught hold of her </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  she exclaimed he is therehe is thereoh </s>
<s>  why does
he not look at me </s>
<s>  why cannot i speak to him </s>
<s> 

pray pray be composed cried elinor and do not betray what you
feel to every body present </s>
<s>   perhaps he has not observed you yet </s>
<s> 

this however was more than she could believe herself </s>
<s>  and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne it
was beyond her wish </s>
<s>   she sat in an agony of impatience which affected
every feature </s>
<s> 

at last he turned round again and regarded them both </s>
<s>  she started up
and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection held out her hand to
him </s>
<s>   he approached and addressing himself rather to elinor than
marianne as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe
her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after <abvr> dashwood and
asked how long they had been in town </s>
<s>   elinor was robbed of all
presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word </s>
<s>   but
the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed </s>
<s>   her face was
crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion
good god </s>
<s>  willoughby what is the meaning of this </s>
<s>   have you not
received my letters </s>
<s>   will you not shake hands with me </s>
<s> 

he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he
held her hand only for a moment </s>
<s>   during all this time he was evidently
struggling for composure </s>
<s>   elinor watched his countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil </s>
<s>   after a moments pause he spoke
with calmness </s>
<s> 

i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday
and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and <abvr> jennings at home </s>
<s>   my card was not lost i hope </s>
<s> 

but have you not received my notes </s>
<s>  cried marianne in the wildest
anxiety </s>
<s>   here is some mistake i am suresome dreadful mistake </s>
<s>   what
can be the meaning of it </s>
<s>   tell me willoughby </s>
<s>  for heavens sake tell
me what is the matter </s>
<s> 

he made no reply </s>
<s>  his complexion changed and all his embarrassment
returned </s>
<s>  but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he
had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion
he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so
good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
his friend </s>
<s> 

marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into
her chair and elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried
to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with
lavender water </s>
<s> 

go to him elinor she cried as soon as she could speak and force
him to come to me </s>
<s>   tell him i must see him againmust speak to him
instantly </s>
<s>  i cannot resti shall not have a moments peace till this
is explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other </s>
<s>  oh go to him
this moment </s>
<s> 

how can that be done </s>
<s>  no my dearest marianne you must wait </s>
<s>   this is
not the place for explanations </s>
<s>   wait only till tomorrow </s>
<s> 

with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him
herself </s>
<s>  and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least
with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more
privacy and more effect was impossible </s>
<s>  for marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings
by exclamations of wretchedness </s>
<s>   in a short time elinor saw willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase and telling marianne
that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that
evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm </s>
<s>   she instantly begged
her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home as she was
too miserable to stay a minute longer </s>
<s> 

lady middleton though in the middle of a rubber on being informed
that marianne was unwell was too polite to object for a moment to her
wish of going away and making over her cards to a friend they
departed as soon the carriage could be found </s>
<s>   scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to berkeley street </s>
<s>   marianne was in a
silent agony too much oppressed even for tears </s>
<s>  but as <abvr> jennings
was luckily not come home they could go directly to their own room
where hartshorn restored her a little to herself </s>
<s>   she was soon
undressed and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone her
sister then left her and while she waited the return of <abvr> jennings
had leisure enough for thinking over the past </s>
<s> 

that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby and
marianne she could not doubt and that willoughby was weary of it
seemed equally clear </s>
<s>  for however marianne might still feed her own
wishes she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind </s>
<s>   nothing but a thorough change of
sentiment could account for it </s>
<s>   her indignation would have been still
stronger than it was had she not witnessed that embarrassment which
seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
the affections of her sister from the first without any design that
would bear investigation </s>
<s>   absence might have weakened his regard and
convenience might have determined him to overcome it but that such a
regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt </s>
<s> 

as for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her and on those still more severe which might await her in
its probable consequence she could not reflect without the deepest
concern </s>
<s>   her own situation gained in the comparison </s>
<s>  for while she
could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided in
future her mind might be always supported </s>
<s>   but every circumstance
that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
of marianne in a final separation from willoughbyin an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him </s>

chapter 


before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day or the sun
gained any power over a cold gloomy morning in january marianne only
half dressed was kneeling against one of the windowseats for the sake
of all the little light she could command from it and writing as fast
as a continual flow of tears would permit her </s>
<s>   in this situation
elinor roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs first perceived
her </s>
<s>  and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety
said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness

marianne may i ask </s>
<s> 

no elinor she replied ask nothing </s>
<s>  you will soon know all </s>
<s> 

the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no
longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return
of the same excessive affliction </s>
<s>   it was some minutes before she could
go on with her letter and the frequent bursts of grief which still
obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of
her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the
last time to willoughby </s>
<s> 

elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power </s>
<s>  and
she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not
marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability not to speak to her for the world </s>
<s>   in such
circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long
together </s>
<s>  and the restless state of mariannes mind not only prevented
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place made her
wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding the sight of every
body </s>
<s> 

at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any thing </s>
<s>  and
elinors attention was then all employed not in urging her not in
pitying her nor in appearing to regard her but in endeavouring to
engage <abvr> jenningss notice entirely to herself </s>
<s> 

as this was a favourite meal with <abvr> jennings it lasted a
considerable time and they were just setting themselves after it
round the common working table when a letter was delivered to
marianne which she eagerly caught from the servant and turning of a
deathlike paleness instantly ran out of the room </s>
<s>   elinor who saw as
plainly by this as if she had seen the direction that it must come
from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her
hardly able to hold up her head and sat in such a general tremour as
made her fear it impossible to escape <abvr> jenningss notice </s>
<s>   that good
lady however saw only that marianne had received a letter from
willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke and which she
treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh that she would find it to
her liking </s>
<s>   of elinors distress she was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any thing at all </s>
<s>  and
calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said

upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
life </s>
<s>   my girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish
enough </s>
<s>  but as for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature </s>
<s>   i
hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her waiting much
longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn </s>
<s> 
pray when are they to be married </s>
<s> 

elinor though never less disposed to speak than at that moment
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore
trying to smile replied and have you really maam talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sisters being engaged to <abvr> willoughby </s>
<s>   i
thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to
imply more </s>
<s>  and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive
yourself any longer </s>
<s>   i do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married </s>
<s> 

for shame for shame miss dashwood </s>
<s>  how can you talk so </s>
<s>   dont we
all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in
love with each other from the first moment they met </s>
<s>   did not i see
them together in devonshire every day and all day long </s>
<s>  and did not i
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
clothes </s>
<s>   come come this wont do </s>

yourself you think nobody else has any senses </s>

indeed you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings laughed again but elinor had not spirits to say more
and eager at all events to know what willoughby had written hurried
away to their room where on opening the door she saw marianne
stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand
and two or three others laying by her </s>
<s>   elinor drew near but without
saying a word </s>
<s>  and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed
her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of
tears which at first was scarcely less violent than mariannes </s>
<s>  the
latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction she
put all the letters into elinors hands </s>
<s>  and then covering her face
with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony </s>
<s>   elinor who knew
that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its
course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
itself and then turning eagerly to willoughbys letter read as
follows </s>

abhorrence of the man and so bitter were her feelings against him

sister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread and so
entirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearing

impropriety of their having been written at all </s>

grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs

condemned by the event when marianne perceiving that she had finished

he did </s>

blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear
to him as my own soul could wish </s>

so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication </s>

for a moment or two she could say no more </s>

passed away she added in a firmer tone

dearest marianne who but himself </s>
<s>   by whom can he have been
instigated </s>

by all the world rather than by his own heart </s>

beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not
rather suspect of evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well </s>
<s> 

elinor would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph
my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits </s>
<s>   it is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence </s>

no no cried marianne misery such as mine has no pride </s>

again they were both silent </s>

thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire
without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning
objects through the other </s>
<s>  and marianne seated at the foot of the bed
with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up
willoughbys letter and after shuddering over every sentence
exclaimed

it is too much </s>

<s> 
cruel cruelnothing can acquit you </s>

<s>   whatever
he might have heard against meought he not to have suspended his
belief </s>

<s> whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and
attractive among his female acquaintance </s>

another pause ensued </s>

it would be impossible to go tomorrow </s>
<s>  we owe <abvr> jennings much more
than civility </s>
<s>  and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a
hasty removal as that </s>
<s> 

well then another day or two perhaps </s>

cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people </s>

elinor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so </s>
<s>  but
no attitude could give her ease </s>
<s>  and in restless pain of mind and body
she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more
hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at
all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance </s>
<s>   some lavender drops however which she was at length
persuaded to take were of use </s>

returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless </s>

waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and
walked in with a look of real concern </s>

marianne who turned away her face without attempting to answer </s>

depend on it </s>

he is not the only young man in the world worth having </s>

pretty face you will never want admirers </s>
<s>   well poor thing </s>
<s>   i wont

she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room as if she
supposed her young friends affliction could be increased by noise </s>

marianne to the surprise of her sister determined on dining with
them </s>

<s>   but no she would go down </s>

she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less </s>
<s> 
elinor pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive
though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner
said no more </s>
<s>  and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could
while marianne still remained on the bed was ready to assist her into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it </s>
<s> 

when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer
than her sister had expected </s>
<s>   had she tried to speak or had she been
conscious of half <abvr> jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attentions
to her this calmness could not have been maintained </s>
<s>  but not a
syllable escaped her lips </s>
<s>  and the abstraction of her thoughts
preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her </s>
<s> 

elinor who did justice to <abvr> jenningss kindness though its
effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made
her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her
sister could not make or return for herself </s>
<s>   their good friend saw
that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing was due to her
which might make her at all less so </s>
<s>   she treated her therefore with
all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the

<s>   had not elinor

could have been entertained by <abvr> jenningss endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a
good fire </s>
<s>   as soon however as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer </s>
<s> 
with a hasty exclamation of misery and a sign to her sister not to
follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room </s>
<s> 

poor soul </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings as soon as she was gone how it

<s>   lord </s>
<s>  nothing seems

the lady thenmiss grey i think you called heris very rich </s>

today finished it </s>
<s>   poor soul </s>
<s>   i am sure if i had had a notion of it
i would not have joked her about it for all my money </s>

know how should i guess such a thing </s>

<s>   if i had my senses about me i might have
called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it </s>

it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution <abvr> palmer and
sir john against ever naming <abvr> willoughby or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed before my sister </s>
<s>   their own goodnature

oh </s>

<s> 
no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate </s>

certainly will </s>

does talking ever do you know </s>
<s> 

in this affair it can only do harm </s>
<s>  more so perhaps than in many cases
of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for

join marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room

refused to do </s>

aching head on the pillow and as she hoped in a way to get some quiet
rest before she left her </s>
<s> 

in the drawingroom whither she then repaired she was soon joined by
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings with a wineglass full of something in her hand </s>
<s> 

my dear said she entering i have just recollected that i have
some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was

husband </s>

colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else in the

<s> 

dear maam replied elinor smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended how good you are </s>
<s>   but i have
just left marianne in bed and i hope almost asleep </s>

nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me
leave i will drink the wine myself </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes
earlier was satisfied with the compromise </s>
<s>  and elinor as she
swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a
colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing
powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her sister </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea and by his manner
of looking round the room for marianne elinor immediately fancied that
he neither expected nor wished to see her there and in short that he
was already aware of what occasioned her absence </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings was
not struck by the same thought </s>

across the room to the teatable where elinor presided and whispered
the colonel looks as grave as ever you see </s>

he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers and with a look
which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her
sister </s>

marianne is not well said she </s>

in a stationers shop in pall mall where i had business </s>

pounds </s>

it may be so </s>

a moment </s>

he made no answer </s>

teathings and the arrangement of the card parties the subject was
necessarily dropped </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking and who expected to see the effect of miss

chapter 


from a night of more sleep than she had expected marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had
closed her eyes </s>
<s> 

elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt </s>
<s>  and
before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and
again </s>
<s>  and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
elinors side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
mariannes as before </s>
<s>   sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him </s>
<s>   at one moment she
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world at
another she would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third
could resist it with energy </s>
<s>   in one thing however she was uniform
when it came to the point in avoiding where it was possible the
presence of <abvr> jennings and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it </s>
<s>   her heart was hardened against the belief of <abvr>
jenningss entering into her sorrows with any compassion </s>
<s> 

no no no it cannot be she cried </s>
<s>  she cannot feel </s>
<s>   her kindness
is not sympathy </s>
<s>  her goodnature is not tenderness </s>
<s>   all that she wants
is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it </s>
<s> 

elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her
sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable
refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished
manner </s>
<s>   like half the rest of the world if more than half there be
that are clever and good marianne with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid </s>
<s>   she expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself </s>
<s>   thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast which sunk the heart of <abvr>
jennings still lower in her estimation </s>
<s>  because through her own
weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill </s>
<s> 

with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling
from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying

now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good </s>
<s> 

marianne heard enough </s>
<s>   in one moment her imagination placed before her
a letter from willoughby full of tenderness and contrition
explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory convincing </s>
<s>  and
instantly followed by willoughby himself rushing eagerly into the room
to inforce at her feet by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances
of his letter </s>
<s>   the work of one moment was destroyed by the next </s>
<s>   the
hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome was before her </s>
<s> 
and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
ecstasy of more than hope she felt as if till that instant she had
never suffered </s>
<s> 

the cruelty of <abvr> jennings no language within her reach in her
moments of happiest eloquence could have expressed </s>
<s>  and now she could
reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
passionate violencea reproach however so entirely lost on its
object that after many expressions of pity she withdrew still
referring her to the letter of comfort </s>
<s>   but the letter when she was
calm enough to read it brought little comfort </s>
<s>   willoughby filled
every page </s>
<s>   her mother still confident of their engagement and
relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by
elinors application to intreat from marianne greater openness towards
them both </s>
<s>  and this with such tenderness towards her such affection
for willoughby and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other that she wept with agony through the whole of it </s>
<s> 

all her impatience to be at home again now returned </s>
<s>  her mother was
dearer to her than ever </s>
<s>  dearer through the very excess of her mistaken
confidence in willoughby and she was wildly urgent to be gone </s>
<s> 
elinor unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne
to be in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own except of
patience till their mothers wishes could be known </s>
<s>  and at length she
obtained her sisters consent to wait for that knowledge </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings left them earlier than usual </s>
<s>  for she could not be easy
till the middletons and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself </s>
<s> 
and positively refusing elinors offered attendance went out alone for
the rest of the morning </s>
<s>   elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the
pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by mariannes
letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then
sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat
her directions for the future </s>
<s>  while marianne who came into the
drawingroom on <abvr> jenningss going away remained fixed at the table
where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over
her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her mother </s>
<s> 

in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when
marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was
startled by a rap at the door </s>
<s> 

who can this be </s>
<s>  cried elinor </s>
<s>   so early too </s>
<s>  i thought we had been
safe </s>
<s> 

marianne moved to the window

it is colonel brandon </s>
<s>  said she with vexation </s>
<s>   we are never safe
from him </s>
<s> 

he will not come in as <abvr> jennings is from home </s>
<s> 

i will not trust to that retreating to her own room </s>
<s>   a man who has
nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on
that of others </s>
<s> 

the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on
injustice and error </s>
<s>  for colonel brandon did come in </s>
<s>  and elinor who
was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither and who
saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look and in his
anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister
for esteeming him so lightly </s>
<s> 

i met <abvr> jennings in bond street said he after the first
salutation and she encouraged me to come on </s>

be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn marianne </s>

gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end and hers must be gained by it in time </s>

<s>   on such a subject sighing heavily can i have little
temptation to be diffuse </s>

he stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went
on </s>
<s> 

you have probably entirely forgotten a conversationit is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on youa conversation
between us one evening at barton parkit was the evening of a
dancein which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in
some measure your sister marianne </s>
<s> 

indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it </s>
<s>  he looked pleased
by this remembrance and added

if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender
recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well
in mind as person </s>
<s>   the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits </s>
<s>   this lady was one of my nearest relations an
orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father </s>
<s>   our
ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were
playfellows and friends </s>
<s>   i cannot remember the time when i did not
love eliza </s>
<s>  and my affection for her as we grew up was such as
perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you
might think me incapable of having ever felt </s>
<s>   hers for me was i
believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to <abvr> willoughby and
it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate </s>
<s>   at
seventeen she was lost to me for ever </s>
<s>   she was marriedmarried
against her inclination to my brother </s>
<s>   her fortune was large and our
family estate much encumbered </s>
<s>   and this i fear is all that can be
said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian </s>
<s> 
my brother did not deserve her </s>
<s>  he did not even love her </s>
<s>   i had hoped
that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for
some time it did </s>
<s>  but at last the misery of her situation for she
experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though
she had promised me that nothingbut how blindly i relate </s>
<s>   i have
never told you how this was brought on </s>
<s>   we were within a few hours of
eloping together for scotland </s>
<s>   the treachery or the folly of my
cousins maid betrayed us </s>
<s>   i was banished to the house of a relation
far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement
till my fathers point was gained </s>
<s>   i had depended on her fortitude too
far and the blow was a severe onebut had her marriage been happy so
young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at
least i should not have now to lament it </s>
<s>   this however was not the
case </s>
<s>   my brother had no regard for her </s>
<s>  his pleasures were not what
they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly </s>
<s> 
the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so
inexperienced as <abvr> brandons was but too natural </s>
<s>   she resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her situation </s>
<s>  and happy had it
been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
remembrance of me occasioned </s>
<s>   but can we wonder that with such a
husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or
restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their
marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should
fall </s>
<s>   had i remained in england perhapsbut i meant to promote the
happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose
had procured my exchange </s>
<s>   the shock which her marriage had given me
he continued in a voice of great agitation was of trifling
weightwas nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years
afterwards of her divorce </s>
<s>   it was that which threw this gloomeven

he could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room </s>

distress could not speak </s>
<s>   he saw her concern and coming to her took
her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect </s>
<s>   a few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure </s>
<s> 

it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned
to england </s>
<s>   my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek
for her </s>
<s>  but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy </s>
<s>   i could
not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to
fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of
sin </s>
<s>   her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor
sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person </s>
<s>   he imagined and calmly could he imagine it
that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to
dispose of it for some immediate relief </s>
<s>   at last however and after i
had been six months in england i did find her </s>
<s>   regard for a former
servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to
visit him in a spunginghouse where he was confined for debt </s>
<s>  and
there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate
sister </s>
<s>   so alteredso fadedworn down by acute suffering of every
kind </s>
<s>  hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before
me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom
i had once doted </s>
<s>   what i endured in so beholding herbut i have no
right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe iti have
pained you too much already </s>
<s>   that she was to all appearance in the
last stage of a consumption wasyes in such a situation it was my
greatest comfort </s>

you for nothing </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  miss dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched
for fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all </s>
<s>   i will be
more collectedmore concise </s>
<s>   she left to my care her only child a
little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then
about three years old </s>
<s>   she loved the child and had always kept it
with her </s>
<s>   it was a valued a precious trust to me </s>
<s>  and gladly would i
have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her
education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it </s>
<s>  but i
had no family no home </s>
<s>  and my little eliza was therefore placed at
school </s>
<s>   i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my
brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the
possession of the family property she visited me at delaford </s>
<s>   i
called her a distant relation </s>
<s>  but i am well aware that i have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her </s>
<s>   it is now
three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i
removed her from school to place her under the care of a very
respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life </s>
<s>  and for two years i
had every reason to be pleased with her situation </s>
<s>   but last february
almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared </s>
<s>   i had allowed
her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire
to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her
father there for his health </s>
<s>   i knew him to be a very good sort of man
and i thought well of his daughterbetter than she deserved for with
a most obstinate and illjudged secrecy she would tell nothing would
give no clue though she certainly knew all </s>
<s>   he her father a
wellmeaning but not a quicksighted man could really i believe
give no information </s>
<s>  for he had been generally confined to the house
while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance
they chose </s>
<s>  and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was
convinced himself of his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the
business </s>
<s>   in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone </s>
<s>  all
the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture </s>
<s>   what i
thought what i feared may be imagined </s>
<s>  and what i suffered too </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elinor could it becould willoughby </s>
<s> 

the first news that reached me of her he continued came in a
letter from herself last october </s>
<s>   it was forwarded to me from
delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party
to whitwell </s>
<s>  and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly
which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body
and which i believe gave offence to some </s>
<s>   little did <abvr> willoughby
imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom
he had made poor and miserable </s>
<s>  but had he known it what would it have
availed </s>
<s>   would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of
your sister </s>
<s>   no he had already done that which no man who can feel
for another would do </s>
<s>   he had left the girl whose youth and innocence
he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no
creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address </s>
<s>   he had
left her promising to return </s>
<s>  he neither returned nor wrote nor
relieved her </s>

this is beyond every thing </s>
<s>  exclaimed elinor </s>
<s> 

his character is now before you </s>
<s>  expensive dissipated and worse than

<s>   knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what

<s>   when i came to you last week and found you alone
i came determined to know the truth </s>

now you will comprehend it </s>
<s>   to suffer you all to be so deceived </s>
<s>  to
see your sisterbut what could i do </s>
<s>   i had no hope of interfering
with success </s>
<s>  and sometimes i thought your sisters influence might yet
reclaim him </s>
<s>   but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what
were his designs on her </s>
<s>   whatever they may have been however she may
now and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own
condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she
considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and
pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as
strong as her own and with a mind tormented by selfreproach which
must attend her through life </s>
<s>   surely this comparison must have its use
with her </s>
<s>   she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing </s>
<s>   they
proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace </s>
<s>   on the
contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them </s>

<s>   use your own discretion however in

will be its effect </s>
<s>  but had i not seriously and from my heart believed
it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have
suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family
afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to
raise myself at the expense of others </s>
<s> 

elinors thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness </s>
<s> 
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to
marianne from the communication of what had passed </s>
<s> 

i have been more pained said she by her endeavors to acquit him
than by all the rest </s>
<s>  for it irritates her mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do </s>

she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier </s>

elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying

reluctantly the name of her lover </s>

meeting therefore never got abroad </s>

elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this </s>

resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter </s>

chapter 


when the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss
dashwood to her sister as they very soon were the effect on her was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see </s>

it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither
objection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby and
seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible </s>

though this behaviour assured elinor that the conviction of this guilt
was carried home to her mind though she saw with satisfaction the
effect of it in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called

compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits less violently
irritated than before she did not see her less wretched </s>
<s>   her mind did
become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection </s>

loss of willoughbys character yet more heavily than she had felt the
loss of his heart </s>

misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might once
have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that
she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to elinor </s>

and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister
than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
confession of them </s>
<s> 

to give the feelings or the language of <abvr> dashwood on receiving and
answering elinors letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her daughters had already felt and said </s>
<s>  of a disappointment hardly
less painful than mariannes and an indignation even greater than
elinors </s>
<s>   long letters from her quickly succeeding each other
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought </s>
<s>  to express her
anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat she would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune </s>
<s>   bad indeed must the nature of
mariannes affliction be when her mother could talk of fortitude </s>
<s> 
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets which
she could wish her not to indulge </s>
<s> 

against the interest of her own individual comfort <abvr> dashwood had
determined that it would be better for marianne to be any where at
that time than at barton where every thing within her view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by
constantly placing willoughby before her such as she had always seen
him there </s>
<s>   she recommended it to her daughters therefore by all
means not to shorten their visit to <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  the length of which
though never exactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at
least five or six weeks </s>
<s>   a variety of occupations of objects and of
company which could not be procured at barton would be inevitable
there and might yet she hoped cheat marianne at times into some
interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the
ideas of both might now be spurned by her </s>
<s> 

from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her
friends </s>
<s>   design could never bring them in each others way </s>
<s>  negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise </s>
<s>  and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of
barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at
allenham on his marriage which <abvr> dashwood from foreseeing at first
as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one </s>
<s> 

she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where
they were </s>
<s>  a letter from her soninlaw had told her that he and his
wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother </s>
<s> 

marianne had promised to be guided by her mothers opinion and she
submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved
perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt
it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by
requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only
possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her
mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her ever knowing a moments rest </s>
<s> 

but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her sister </s>
<s>  and elinor on the other
hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward
entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better
for marianne than an immediate return into devonshire </s>
<s> 

her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing willoughbys
name mentioned was not thrown away </s>
<s>   marianne though without knowing
it herself reaped all its advantage </s>
<s>  for neither <abvr> jennings nor
sir john nor even <abvr> palmer herself ever spoke of him before her </s>
<s> 
elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself but that was impossible and she was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all </s>
<s> 

sir john could not have thought it possible </s>
<s>   a man of whom he had
always had such reason to think well </s>
<s>   such a goodnatured fellow </s>
<s>   he
did not believe there was a bolder rider in england </s>
<s>   it was an
unaccountable business </s>
<s>   he wished him at the devil with all his heart </s>
<s> 
he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for
all the world </s>
<s>   no not if it were to be by the side of barton covert
and they were kept watching for two hours together </s>
<s>   such a scoundrel
of a fellow </s>
<s>  such a deceitful dog </s>
<s>   it was only the last time they met
that he had offered him one of follys puppies </s>
<s>  and this was the end of
it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  palmer in her way was equally angry </s>
<s>   she was determined to
drop his acquaintance immediately and she was very thankful that she
had never been acquainted with him at all </s>
<s>   she wished with all her
heart combe magna was not so near cleveland </s>
<s>  but it did not signify
for it was a great deal too far off to visit </s>
<s>  she hated him so much
that she was resolved never to mention his name again and she should
tell everybody she saw how goodfornothing he was </s>
<s> 

the rest of <abvr> palmers sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
particulars in her power of the approaching marriage and communicating
them to elinor </s>
<s>   she could soon tell at what coachmakers the new
carriage was building by what painter <abvr> willoughbys portrait was
drawn and at what warehouse miss greys clothes might be seen </s>
<s> 

the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to elinors spirits oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others </s>
<s>   it was a great comfort to her to be
sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle
of friends </s>
<s>  a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet
her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for
her sisters health </s>
<s> 

every qualification is raised at times by the circumstances of the
moment to more than its real value </s>
<s>  and she was sometimes worried down
by officious condolence to rate goodbreeding as more indispensable to
comfort than goodnature </s>
<s> 

lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day
or twice if the subject occurred very often by saying it is very
shocking indeed </s>
<s>  and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter </s>
<s>  and having thus supported the
dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was
wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather
against the opinion of sir john that as <abvr> willoughby would at once
be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon
as she married </s>
<s> 

colonel brandons delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to miss dashwood </s>
<s>   he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her sisters disappointment by the friendly zeal with
which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always conversed with
confidence </s>
<s>   his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations was given in the pitying eye
with which marianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness of her
voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged or
could oblige herself to speak to him </s>
<s>   these assured him that his
exertion had produced an increase of goodwill towards himself and
these gave elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter </s>
<s>  but
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew only that the
colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail
on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for
him began at the end of two days to think that instead of
midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all </s>
<s>   the good understanding
between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberrytree the canal and the yew arbour would all
be made over to her </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings had for some time ceased to
think at all of <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

early in february within a fortnight from the receipt of willoughbys
letter elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he
was married </s>
<s>   she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over as she was
desirous that marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning </s>
<s> 

she received the news with resolute composure </s>
<s>  made no observation on
it and at first shed no tears </s>
<s>  but after a short time they would burst
out and for the rest of the day she was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event </s>
<s> 

the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married </s>
<s>  and elinor now
hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to
prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before </s>
<s> 

about this time the two miss steeles lately arrived at their cousins
house in bartletts buildings holburn presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets </s>
<s>  and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality </s>
<s> 

elinor only was sorry to see them </s>
<s>   their presence always gave her
pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of lucy in finding her still in town </s>
<s> 

i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here
still said she repeatedly with a strong emphasis on the word </s>
<s>   but
i always thought i should </s>
<s>   i was almost sure you would not leave
london yet awhile </s>
<s>  though you told me you know at barton that you
should not stay above a month </s>

<s>   it would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
sister came </s>
<s>   and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone </s>
<s>   i
am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word </s>

elinor perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her
selfcommand to make it appear that she did not </s>
<s> 

well my dear said <abvr> jennings and how did you travel </s>
<s> 

not in the stage i assure you replied miss steele with quick
exultation </s>
<s>  we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to
attend us </s>
<s>   <abvr> davies was coming to town and so we thought wed join
him in a postchaise </s>
<s>  and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did </s>
<s> 

oh oh </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  very pretty indeed </s>

a single man i warrant you </s>

there now said miss steele affectedly simpering everybody laughs
at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why </s>
<s>   my cousins say they
are sure i have made a conquest </s>

think about him from one hours end to another </s>

street to the house </s>

aye aye that is very pretty talkingbut it wont dothe doctor is

no indeed </s>
<s>  replied her cousin with affected earnestness and i beg
you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she
certainly would not and miss steele was made completely happy </s>
<s> 

i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss
dashwood when they come to town said lucy returning after a
cessation of hostile hints to the charge </s>
<s> 

no i do not think we shall </s>
<s> 

oh yes i dare say you will </s>
<s> 

elinor would not humour her by farther opposition </s>
<s> 

what a charming thing it is that <abvr> dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together </s>
<s> 

long a time indeed </s>
<s>  interposed <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   why their visit is
but just begun </s>
<s> 

lucy was silenced </s>
<s> 

i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood said miss
steele </s>
<s>   i am sorry she is not well for marianne had left the room
on their arrival </s>
<s> 

you are very good </s>
<s>   my sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you </s>
<s>  but she has been very much plagued lately with
nervous headaches which make her unfit for company or conversation </s>
<s> 

oh dear that is a great pity </s>
<s>  but such old friends as lucy and
me </s>
<s> i think she might see us </s>
<s>  and i am sure we would not speak a word </s>
<s> 

elinor with great civility declined the proposal </s>
<s>   her sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore
not able to come to them </s>
<s> 

oh if thats all cried miss steele we can just as well go and see
her </s>
<s> 

elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper </s>
<s>  but she
was saved the trouble of checking it by lucys sharp reprimand which
now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other </s>

chapter 


after some opposition marianne yielded to her sisters entreaties and
consented to go out with her and <abvr> jennings one morning for half an
hour </s>
<s>  she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and
would do no more than accompany them to grays in sackville street
where elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
oldfashioned jewels of her mother </s>
<s> 

when they stopped at the door <abvr> jennings recollected that there was
a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call </s>
<s>  and as
she had no business at grays it was resolved that while her young
friends transacted theirs she should pay her visit and return for
them </s>
<s> 

on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders </s>
<s>  and they were obliged to wait </s>
<s>   all that could be done
was to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession </s>
<s>  one gentleman only was standing there and it is
probable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to
a quicker despatch </s>
<s>   but the correctness of his eye and the delicacy
of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness </s>
<s>   he was giving orders
for a toothpickcase for himself and till its size shape and
ornaments were determined all of which after examining and debating
for a quarter of an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop were
finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure to
bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised
in three or four very broad stares </s>
<s>  a kind of notice which served to
imprint on elinor the remembrance of a person and face of strong
natural sterling insignificance though adorned in the first style of
fashion </s>
<s> 

marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on
the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpickcases presented to his inspection by remaining
unconscious of it all </s>
<s>  for she was as well able to collect her thoughts
within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in
mr </s>
<s>  grays shop as in her own bedroom </s>
<s> 

at last the affair was decided </s>
<s>   the ivory the gold and the pearls
all received their appointment and the gentleman having named the last
day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of
the toothpickcase drew on his gloves with leisurely care and
bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such a one as
seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with a
happy air of real conceit and affected indifference </s>
<s> 

elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward was on the point
of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side </s>
<s> 
she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise
to be her brother </s>
<s> 

their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in <abvr> grays shop </s>
<s>   john dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his sisters again </s>
<s>  it rather gave them
satisfaction </s>
<s>  and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive </s>
<s> 

elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days </s>
<s> 

i wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it was
impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at
exeter exchange </s>
<s>  and we spent the rest of the day with <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 
harry was vastly pleased </s>
<s>   this morning i had fully intended to call on
you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so
much to do on first coming to town </s>
<s>   i am come here to bespeak fanny a
seal </s>
<s>   but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in
berkeley street and be introduced to your friend <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   i
understand she is a woman of very good fortune </s>
<s>   and the middletons
too you must introduce me to them </s>
<s>   as my motherinlaws relations i
shall be happy to show them every respect </s>
<s>   they are excellent
neighbours to you in the country i understand </s>
<s> 

excellent indeed </s>
<s>   their attention to our comfort their friendliness
in every particular is more than i can express </s>
<s> 

i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word </s>
<s>  extremely glad indeed </s>
<s> 
but so it ought to be </s>
<s>  they are people of large fortune they are
related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected </s>
<s>   and so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing </s>
<s>   edward brought us a most charming account of the place </s>
<s>  the
most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing </s>
<s>   it was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it i assure you </s>
<s> 

elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother </s>
<s>  and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of <abvr>
jenningss servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for
them at the door </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to <abvr> jennings
at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to
call on them the next day took leave </s>
<s> 

his visit was duly paid </s>
<s>   he came with a pretence at an apology from
their sisterinlaw for not coming too </s>
<s>  but she was so much engaged
with her mother that really she had no leisure for going any where </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand
upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she
should certainly wait on <abvr> john dashwood very soon and bring her
sisters to see her </s>
<s>   his manners to them though calm were perfectly
kind </s>
<s>  to <abvr> jennings most attentively civil </s>
<s>  and on colonel
brandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity
which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be
equally civil to him </s>
<s> 

after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with him
to conduit street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton </s>
<s> 
the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented </s>
<s>   as soon as
they were out of the house his enquiries began </s>
<s> 

who is colonel brandon </s>
<s>   is he a man of fortune </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  he has very good property in dorsetshire </s>
<s> 

i am glad of it </s>
<s>   he seems a most gentlemanlike man </s>
<s>  and i think
elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life </s>
<s> 

me brother </s>
<s>  what do you mean </s>
<s> 

he likes you </s>
<s>   i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it </s>
<s>   what
is the amount of his fortune </s>
<s> 

i believe about two thousand a year </s>
<s> 

two thousand ayear </s>
<s>  and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity he added elinor i wish with all my heart it
were twice as much for your sake </s>
<s> 

indeed i believe you replied elinor </s>
<s>  but i am very sure that
colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken elinor </s>
<s>  you are very much mistaken </s>
<s>   a very little
trouble on your side secures him </s>
<s>   perhaps just at present he may be
undecided </s>
<s>  the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back </s>
<s>  his
friends may all advise him against it </s>
<s>   but some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him in spite of himself </s>
<s>   and there can be no reason why you should
not try for him </s>
<s>   it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your sidein short you know as to an attachment of that kind it is
quite out of the question the objections are insurmountableyou have
too much sense not to see all that </s>
<s>   colonel brandon must be the man </s>
<s> 
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with
you and your family </s>
<s>   it is a match that must give universal
satisfaction </s>
<s>   in short it is a kind of thing thatlowering his
voice to an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome to all
parties </s>
<s>  recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to
sayyour friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled </s>
<s>  fanny
particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure
you </s>
<s>   and her mother too <abvr> ferrars a very goodnatured woman i am
sure it would give her great pleasure </s>
<s>  she said as much the other day </s>
<s> 

elinor would not vouchsafe any answer </s>
<s> 

it would be something remarkable now he continued something
droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the
same time </s>
<s>   and yet it is not very unlikely </s>
<s> 

is <abvr> edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be
married </s>
<s> 

it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation </s>
<s> 
he has a most excellent mother </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars with the utmost
liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if
the match takes place </s>
<s>   the lady is the hon </s>
<s>  miss morton only daughter
of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds </s>
<s>   a very desirable
connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in
time </s>
<s>   a thousand ayear is a great deal for a mother to give away to
make over for ever </s>
<s>  but <abvr> ferrars has a noble spirit </s>
<s>   to give you
another instance of her liberality </s>
<s> the other day as soon as we came
to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now
she put banknotes into fannys hands to the amount of two hundred
pounds </s>
<s>   and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great
expense while we are here </s>
<s> 

he paused for her assent and compassion </s>
<s>  and she forced herself to say

your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable </s>
<s> 
but your income is a large one </s>
<s> 

not so large i dare say as many people suppose </s>
<s>   i do not mean to
complain however </s>
<s>  it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will
in time be better </s>
<s>   the enclosure of norland common now carrying on
is a most serious drain </s>
<s>   and then i have made a little purchase within
this half year </s>
<s>  east kingham farm you must remember the place where
old gibson used to live </s>
<s>   the land was so very desirable for me in
every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it
my duty to buy it </s>
<s>   i could not have answered it to my conscience to
let it fall into any other hands </s>
<s>   a man must pay for his convenience </s>
<s> 
and it has cost me a vast deal of money </s>
<s> 

more than you think it really and intrinsically worth </s>
<s> 

why i hope not that </s>
<s>   i might have sold it again the next day for
more than i gave </s>
<s>  but with regard to the purchasemoney i might have
been very unfortunate indeed </s>
<s>  for the stocks were at that time so low
that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my bankers
hands i must have sold out to very great loss </s>
<s> 

elinor could only smile </s>
<s> 

other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
norland </s>
<s>   our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the
stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were
to your mother </s>
<s>   far be it from me to repine at his doing so </s>
<s>  he had an
undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in
consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of
linen china &c </s>
<s>  to supply the place of what was taken away </s>
<s>   you may
guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being
rich and how acceptable <abvr> ferrarss kindness is </s>
<s> 

certainly said elinor </s>
<s>  and assisted by her liberality i hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances </s>
<s> 

another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied </s>
<s>  but
however there is still a great deal to be done </s>
<s>   there is not a stone
laid of fannys greenhouse and nothing but the plan of the
flowergarden marked out </s>
<s> 

where is the greenhouse to be </s>
<s> 

upon the knoll behind the house </s>
<s>   the old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it </s>
<s>   it will be a very fine object from many
parts of the park and the flowergarden will slope down just before
it and be exceedingly pretty </s>
<s>   we have cleared away all the old thorns
that grew in patches over the brow </s>
<s> 

elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself </s>
<s>  and was very
thankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation </s>
<s> 

having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of earrings for each of his sisters in his
next visit at grays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began
to congratulate elinor on having such a friend as <abvr> jennings </s>
<s> 

she seems a most valuable woman indeedher house her style of
living all bespeak an exceeding good income </s>
<s>  and it is an acquaintance
that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may
prove materially advantageous </s>
<s> her inviting you to town is certainly a
vast thing in your favour </s>
<s>  and indeed it speaks altogether so great a
regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be
forgotten </s>
<s>  she must have a great deal to leave </s>
<s> 

nothing at all i should rather suppose </s>
<s>  for she has only her
jointure which will descend to her children </s>
<s> 

but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income </s>
<s>   few
people of common prudence will do that </s>
<s>  and whatever she saves she
will be able to dispose of </s>
<s> 

and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her
daughters than to us </s>
<s> 

her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i
cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther </s>
<s> 
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and
treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on
her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not
disregard </s>
<s>   nothing can be kinder than her behaviour </s>
<s>  and she can
hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises </s>
<s> 

but she raises none in those most concerned </s>
<s>   indeed brother your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far </s>
<s> 

why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have

<s>   but my dear elinor what is
the matter with marianne </s>
<s>  she looks very unwell has lost her colour
and is grown quite thin </s>
<s>   is she ill </s>
<s> 

she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several
weeks </s>
<s> 

i am sorry for that </s>
<s>   at her time of life any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever </s>
<s>   hers has been a very short one </s>
<s>   she was
as handsome a girl last september as i ever saw </s>
<s>  and as likely to
attract the man </s>
<s>   there was something in her style of beauty to please
them particularly </s>
<s>   i remember fanny used to say that she would marry
sooner and better than you did </s>
<s>  not but what she is exceedingly fond of
you but so it happened to strike her </s>
<s>   she will be mistaken however </s>
<s> 
i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred ayear at the utmost and i am very much deceived if
you do not do better </s>
<s>   dorsetshire </s>
<s>   i know very little of dorsetshire </s>
<s> 
but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it </s>
<s> 
and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors </s>
<s> 

elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no
likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon </s>
<s>  but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention </s>
<s>   he had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal </s>
<s>  and an offer from
colonel brandon or a legacy from <abvr> jennings was the easiest means
of atoning for his own neglect </s>
<s> 

they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home and sir john
came in before their visit ended </s>
<s>   abundance of civilities passed on
all sides </s>
<s>   sir john was ready to like anybody and though <abvr> dashwood
did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very
goodnatured fellow </s>
<s>  while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his
appearance to think his acquaintance worth having </s>
<s>  and <abvr> dashwood
went away delighted with both </s>
<s> 

i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny said he as he
walked back with his sister </s>
<s>   lady middleton is really a most elegant
woman </s>
<s>   such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know </s>
<s>   and <abvr>
jennings too an exceedingly wellbehaved woman though not so elegant
as her daughter </s>
<s>   your sister need not have any scruple even of
visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and
very naturally </s>
<s>  for we only knew that <abvr> jennings was the widow of a
man who had got all his money in a low way </s>
<s>  and fanny and <abvr> ferrars
were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters
were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with </s>
<s>   but now
i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  john dashwood had so much confidence in her husbands judgment
that she waited the very next day both on <abvr> jennings and her
daughter </s>
<s>  and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthy
her notice </s>
<s>  and as for lady middleton she found her one of the most
charming women in the world </s>
<s> 

lady middleton was equally pleased with <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   there was a
kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually
attracted them </s>
<s>  and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
propriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding </s>
<s> 

the same manners however which recommended <abvr> john dashwood to the
good opinion of lady middleton did not suit the fancy of <abvr> jennings
and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proudlooking woman
of uncordial address who met her husbands sisters without any
affection and almost without having anything to say to them </s>
<s>  for of
the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at least
seven minutes and a half in silence </s>
<s> 

elinor wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to ask
whether edward was then in town </s>
<s>  but nothing would have induced fanny
voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that
his marriage with miss morton was resolved on or till her husbands
expectations on colonel brandon were answered </s>
<s>  because she believed
them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion </s>
<s>   the
intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from
another quarter </s>
<s>   lucy came very shortly to claim elinors compassion
on being unable to see edward though he had arrived in town with <abvr>
and <abvr> dashwood </s>
<s>   he dared not come to bartletts buildings for fear
of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be
told they could do nothing at present but write </s>
<s> 

edward assured them himself of his being in town within a very short
time by twice calling in berkeley street </s>
<s>   twice was his card found on
the table when they returned from their mornings engagements </s>
<s>   elinor
was pleased that he had called </s>
<s>  and still more pleased that she had
missed him </s>
<s> 

the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the middletons that
though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to
give thema dinner </s>
<s>  and soon after their acquaintance began invited
them to dine in harley street where they had taken a very good house
for three months </s>
<s>   their sisters and <abvr> jennings were invited
likewise and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon who
always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager
civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure </s>
<s>   they were to
meet <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  but elinor could not learn whether her sons were to
be of the party </s>
<s>   the expectation of seeing her however was enough to
make her interested in the engagement </s>
<s>  for though she could now meet
edwards mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction though she could now see her with perfect
indifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being in
company with <abvr> ferrars her curiosity to know what she was like was
as lively as ever </s>
<s> 

the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon
afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearing
that the miss steeles were also to be at it </s>
<s> 

so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeable
had their assiduities made them to her that though lucy was certainly
not so elegant and her sister not even genteel she was as ready as
sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street </s>
<s>  and it
happened to be particularly convenient to the miss steeles as soon as
the dashwoods invitation was known that their visit should begin a
few days before the party took place </s>
<s> 

their claims to the notice of <abvr> john dashwood as the nieces of the
gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not
have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table </s>
<s>  but
as lady middletons guests they must be welcome </s>
<s>  and lucy who had long
wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of
their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity
of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life
than she was on receiving <abvr> john dashwoods card </s>
<s> 

on elinor its effect was very different </s>
<s>   she began immediately to
determine that edward who lived with his mother must be asked as his
mother was to a party given by his sister </s>
<s>  and to see him for the
first time after all that passed in the company of lucy </s>
<s> she hardly
knew how she could bear it </s>
<s> 

these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and
certainly not at all on truth </s>
<s>   they were relieved however not by her
own recollection but by the good will of lucy who believed herself to
be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that edward
certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal
when they were together </s>
<s> 

the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable motherinlaw </s>
<s> 

pity me dear miss dashwood </s>
<s>  said lucy as they walked up the stairs
togetherfor the middletons arrived so directly after <abvr> jennings
that they all followed the servant at the same timethere is nobody
here but you that can feel for me </s>
<s> i declare i can hardly stand </s>
<s> 
good gracious </s>
<s> in a moment i shall see the person that all my
happiness depends onthat is to be my mother </s>
<s> 

elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being miss mortons mother rather than her own
whom they were about to behold </s>
<s>  but instead of doing that she assured
her and with great sincerity that she did pity herto the utter
amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars was a little thin woman upright even to formality in
her figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect </s>
<s>   her
complexion was sallow </s>
<s>  and her features small without beauty and
naturally without expression </s>
<s>  but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature </s>
<s>   she was not a woman of
many words </s>
<s>  for unlike people in general she proportioned them to the
number of her ideas </s>
<s>  and of the few syllables that did escape her not
one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed with the spirited
determination of disliking her at all events </s>
<s> 

elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour </s>
<s>  a few months
ago it would have hurt her exceedingly </s>
<s>  but it was not in <abvr> ferrars
power to distress her by it now </s>
<s> and the difference of her manners to
the miss steeles a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her more only amused her </s>
<s>   she could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person for
lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others had they known
as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify </s>
<s>  while
she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat
pointedly slighted by both </s>
<s>   but while she smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied she could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from which
it sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the miss
steeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all
four </s>
<s> 

lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished </s>
<s>  and miss
steele wanted only to be teazed about <abvr> davies to be perfectly happy </s>
<s> 

the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thing
bespoke the mistresss inclination for show and the masters ability
to support it </s>
<s>   in spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the norland estate and in spite of its owner having once
been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
loss nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to
infer from it </s>
<s> no poverty of any kind except of conversation
appearedbut there the deficiency was considerable </s>
<s>   john dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife
had still less </s>
<s>   but there was no peculiar disgrace in this </s>
<s>  for it was
very much the case with the chief of their visitors who almost all
laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeablewant of sense either natural or improvedwant of
elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper </s>
<s> 

when the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom after dinner this poverty
was particularly evident for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse
with some varietythe variety of politics inclosing land and
breaking horsesbut then it was all over </s>
<s>  and one subject only engaged
the ladies till coffee came in which was the comparative heights of
harry dashwood and lady middletons second son william who were
nearly of the same age </s>
<s> 

had both the children been there the affair might have been determined
too easily by measuring them at once </s>
<s>  but as harry only was present it
was all conjectural assertion on both sides </s>
<s>  and every body had a right
to be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over
again as often as they liked </s>
<s> 

the parties stood thus </s>
<s> 

the two mothers though each really convinced that her own son was the
tallest politely decided in favour of the other </s>
<s> 

the two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity
were equally earnest in support of their own descendant </s>
<s> 

lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age and could not
conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them </s>
<s>  and miss steele with yet greater address gave it as
fast as she could in favour of each </s>
<s> 

elinor having once delivered her opinion on williams side by which
she offended <abvr> ferrars and fanny still more did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion </s>
<s>  and marianne when
called on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had no
opinion to give as she had never thought about it </s>
<s> 

before her removing from norland elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her sisterinlaw which being now just mounted and
brought home ornamented her present drawing room </s>
<s>  and these screens
catching the eye of john dashwood on his following the other gentlemen
into the room were officiously handed by him to colonel brandon for
his admiration </s>
<s> 

these are done by my eldest sister said he </s>
<s>  and you as a man of
taste will i dare say be pleased with them </s>
<s>   i do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well </s>
<s> 

the colonel though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship
warmly admired the screens as he would have done any thing painted by
miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited they were handed round for general inspection </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars
not aware of their being elinors work particularly requested to look
at them </s>
<s>  and after they had received gratifying testimony of lady
middletonss approbation fanny presented them to her mother
considerately informing her at the same time that they were done by
miss dashwood </s>
<s> 

humsaid <abvr> ferrarsvery prettyand without regarding them at
all returned them to her daughter </s>
<s> 

perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude
enoughfor colouring a little she immediately said

they are very pretty maamant they </s>
<s>  but then again the dread of
having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her
for she presently added

do you not think they are something in miss mortons style of
painting maam </s>
<s> she does paint most delightfully </s>
<s> how beautifully
her last landscape is done </s>
<s> 

beautifully indeed </s>
<s>   but she does every thing well </s>
<s> 

marianne could not bear this </s>
<s> she was already greatly displeased with
mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars </s>
<s>  and such illtimed praise of another at elinors
expense though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it provoked her immediately to say with warmth

this is admiration of a very particular kind </s>
<s> what is miss morton to
us </s>
<s> who knows or who cares for her </s>
<s> it is elinor of whom we think
and speak </s>
<s> 

and so saying she took the screens out of her sisterinlaws hands
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing herself up more
stiffly than ever pronounced in retort this bitter philippic miss
morton is lord mortons daughter </s>
<s> 

fanny looked very angry too and her husband was all in a fright at his
sisters audacity </s>
<s>   elinor was much more hurt by mariannes warmth than
she had been by what produced it </s>
<s>  but colonel brandons eyes as they
were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only what was amiable
in it the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point </s>
<s> 

mariannes feelings did not stop here </s>
<s>   the cold insolence of <abvr>
ferrarss general behaviour to her sister seemed to her to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to elinor as her own wounded heart
taught her to think of with horror </s>
<s>  and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sisters
chair and putting one arm round her neck and one cheek close to hers
said in a low but eager voice

dear dear elinor dont mind them </s>
<s>   dont let them make you unhappy </s>
<s> 

she could say no more </s>
<s>  her spirits were quite overcome and hiding her
face on elinors shoulder she burst into tears </s>
<s>   every bodys
attention was called and almost every body was concerned </s>
<s> colonel
brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s> 
jennings with a very intelligent ah </s>
<s>  poor dear immediately gave her
her salts </s>
<s>  and sir john felt so desperately enraged against the author
of this nervous distress that he instantly changed his seat to one
close by lucy steele and gave her in a whisper a brief account of
the whole shocking affair </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes however marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle and sit down among the rest </s>
<s>  though her spirits retained
the impression of what had passed the whole evening </s>
<s> 

poor marianne </s>
<s>  said her brother to colonel brandon in a low voice
as soon as he could secure his attention she has not such good
health as her sistershe is very nervousshe has not elinors
constitution </s>
<s> and one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal
attractions </s>
<s>   you would not think it perhaps but marianne was
remarkably handsome a few months ago </s>
<s>  quite as handsome as elinor </s>
<s> 
now you see it is all gone </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elinors curiosity to see <abvr> ferrars was satisfied </s>
<s>  she had found
in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable </s>
<s>  she had seen enough of her pride her
meanness and her determined prejudice against herself to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement and
retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise
free </s>
<s> and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake
that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other
of <abvr> ferrarss creation preserved her from all dependence upon her
caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion </s>
<s>   or at least if she
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edwards being fettered to
lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable she ought to
have rejoiced </s>
<s> 

she wondered that lucys spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> that her interest and her vanity should so
very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her
because she was not elinor appear a compliment to herselfor to allow
her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her because
her real situation was unknown </s>
<s>   but that it was so had not only been
declared by lucys eyes at the time but was declared over again the
next morning more openly for at her particular desire lady middleton
set her down in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone
to tell her how happy she was </s>
<s> 

the chance proved a lucky one for a message from <abvr> palmer soon
after she arrived carried <abvr> jennings away </s>
<s> 

my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were by themselves i
come to talk to you of my happiness </s>
<s>   could anything be so flattering
as <abvr> ferrarss way of treating me yesterday </s>
<s>   so exceeding affable
as she was </s>
<s> you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her </s>
<s> but
the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her
behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to
me </s>
<s>   now was not it so </s>
<s>  you saw it all </s>
<s>  and was not you quite struck
with it </s>
<s> 

she was certainly very civil to you </s>
<s> 

civil </s>
<s> did you see nothing but only civility </s>
<s>  i saw a vast deal
more </s>
<s>   such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me </s>
<s> no pride
no hauteur and your sister just the sameall sweetness and
affability </s>
<s> 

elinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still pressed her to
own that she had reason for her happiness </s>
<s>  and elinor was obliged to go
on </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of you </s>
<s> but as that was
not the case

i guessed you would say soreplied lucy quicklybut there was no
reason in the world why <abvr> ferrars should seem to like me if she did
not and her liking me is every thing </s>
<s>   you shant talk me out of my
satisfaction </s>
<s>   i am sure it will all end well and there will be no
difficulties at all to what i used to think </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is a
charming woman and so is your sister </s>
<s>   they are both delightful women
indeed </s>
<s> i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable <abvr>
dashwood was </s>
<s> 

to this elinor had no answer to make and did not attempt any </s>
<s> 

are you ill miss dashwood </s>
<s> you seem lowyou dont speak </s>
<s> sure you
ant well </s>
<s> 

i never was in better health </s>
<s> 

i am glad of it with all my heart </s>

<s>   i
should be sorry to have you ill </s>
<s>  you that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world </s>
<s> heaven knows what i should have done
without your friendship </s>
<s> 

elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success </s>
<s> 
but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she directly replied

indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next to
edwards love it is the greatest comfort i have </s>
<s> poor edward </s>
<s> but
now there is one good thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty
often for lady middletons delighted with <abvr> dashwood so we shall
be a good deal in harley street i dare say and edward spends half his
time with his sisterbesides lady middleton and <abvr> ferrars will
visit now </s>
<s> and <abvr> ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once they should always be glad to see me </s>
<s>  they are such
charming women </s>
<s> i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of
her you cannot speak too high </s>
<s> 

but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she should
tell her sister </s>
<s>   lucy continued </s>
<s> 

i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if <abvr> ferrars had took
a dislike to me </s>
<s>   if she had only made me a formal courtesy for
instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of
me and never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know what i meanif
i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave
it all up in despair </s>
<s>   i could not have stood it </s>
<s>   for where she does
dislike i know it is most violent </s>
<s> 

elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by
the doors being thrown open the servants announcing <abvr> ferrars and
edwards immediately walking in </s>
<s> 

it was a very awkward moment </s>
<s>  and the countenance of each shewed that
it was so </s>
<s>   they all looked exceedingly foolish </s>
<s>  and edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to
advance farther into it </s>
<s>   the very circumstance in its unpleasantest
form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen
on them </s>
<s> they were not only all three together but were together
without the relief of any other person </s>
<s>   the ladies recovered
themselves first </s>
<s>   it was not lucys business to put herself forward
and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up </s>
<s>   she could
therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him
said no more </s>
<s> 

but elinor had more to do </s>
<s>  and so anxious was she for his sake and her
own to do it well that she forced herself after a moments
recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost
easy and almost open </s>
<s>  and another struggle another effort still
improved them </s>
<s>   she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from
saying that she was happy to see him and that she had very much
regretted being from home when he called before in berkeley street </s>
<s> 
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as
a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of
lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her </s>
<s> 

her manners gave some reassurance to edward and he had courage enough
to sit down </s>
<s>  but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might
make it rare </s>
<s>  for his heart had not the indifference of lucys nor
could his conscience have quite the ease of elinors </s>
<s> 

lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word </s>
<s> 
and almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her mothers health
their coming to town &c </s>
<s>  which edward ought to have inquired about
but never did </s>
<s> 

her exertions did not stop here </s>
<s>  for she soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching
marianne to leave the others by themselves </s>
<s>  and she really did it and
that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on
the landingplace with the most highminded fortitude before she went
to her sister </s>
<s>   when that was once done however it was time for the
raptures of edward to cease </s>
<s>  for mariannes joy hurried her into the
drawingroom immediately </s>
<s>   her pleasure in seeing him was like every
other of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken </s>
<s>   she met
him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the
affection of a sister </s>
<s> 

dear edward </s>
<s>  she cried this is a moment of great happiness </s>
<s> this
would almost make amends for every thing </s>
<s> 

edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such
witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt </s>
<s>   again they all
sat down and for a moment or two all were silent </s>
<s>  while marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and
sometimes at elinor regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by lucys unwelcome presence </s>
<s>   edward was the first
to speak and it was to notice mariannes altered looks and express
his fear of her not finding london agree with her </s>
<s> 

oh dont think of me </s>
<s>  she replied with spirited earnestness though
her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke dont think of my
health </s>
<s>   elinor is well you see </s>
<s>   that must be enough for us both </s>
<s> 

this remark was not calculated to make edward or elinor more easy nor
to conciliate the good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with no
very benignant expression </s>
<s> 

do you like london </s>
<s>  said edward willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>   i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none </s>
<s> 
the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded </s>
<s>  and
thank heaven </s>
<s>  you are what you always were </s>
<s> 

she pausedno one spoke </s>
<s> 

i think elinor she presently added we must employ edward to take
care of us in our return to barton </s>
<s>   in a week or two i suppose we
shall be going </s>
<s>  and i trust edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge </s>
<s> 

poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even
himself </s>
<s>   but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily trace
it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and
soon talked of something else </s>
<s> 

we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday </s>
<s>   so dull so
wretchedly dull </s>
<s> but i have much to say to you on that head which
cannot be said now </s>
<s> 

and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever and of her
being particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more in
private </s>
<s> 

but why were you not there edward </s>
<s> why did you not come </s>
<s> 

i was engaged elsewhere </s>
<s> 

engaged </s>
<s>   but what was that when such friends were to be met </s>
<s> 

perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take some revenge on
her you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no
mind to keep them little as well as great </s>
<s> 

elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting </s>
<s>  for she calmly replied

not so indeed </s>
<s>  for seriously speaking i am very sure that
conscience only kept edward from harley street </s>
<s>   and i really believe
he has the most delicate conscience in the world </s>
<s>  the most scrupulous
in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make
against his interest or pleasure </s>
<s>   he is the most fearful of giving
pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish
of any body i ever saw </s>

<s>   what </s>
<s> 
are you never to hear yourself praised </s>
<s> then you must be no friend of
mine </s>
<s>  for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to
my open commendation </s>
<s> 

the nature of her commendation in the present case however happened
to be particularly illsuited to the feelings of two thirds of her
auditors and was so very unexhilarating to edward that he very soon
got up to go away </s>
<s> 

going so soon </s>
<s>  said marianne </s>
<s>  my dear edward this must not be </s>
<s> 

and drawing him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that lucy
could not stay much longer </s>
<s>   but even this encouragement failed for he
would go </s>
<s>  and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted
two hours soon afterwards went away </s>
<s> 

what can bring her here so often </s>
<s>  said marianne on her leaving them </s>
<s> 
could not she see that we wanted her gone </s>
<s> how teazing to edward </s>
<s> 

why so </s>
<s> we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known
to him of any </s>
<s>   it is but natural that he should like to see her as
well as ourselves </s>
<s> 

marianne looked at her steadily and said you know elinor that this
is a kind of talking which i cannot bear </s>
<s>   if you only hope to have
your assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case you
ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it </s>
<s>   i
cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not really
wanted </s>
<s> 

she then left the room </s>
<s>  and elinor dared not follow her to say more
for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to lucy she could give
no information that would convince marianne </s>
<s>  and painful as the
consequences of her still continuing in an error might be she was
obliged to submit to it </s>
<s>   all that she could hope was that edward
would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing
mariannes mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meetingand this she had every
reason to expect </s>

chapter 


within a few days after this meeting the newspapers announced to the
world that the lady of thomas palmer esq </s>
<s>  was safely delivered of a
son and heir </s>
<s>  a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before </s>
<s> 

this event highly important to <abvr> jenningss happiness produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her time and influenced in a
like degree the engagements of her young friends </s>
<s>  for as she wished to
be as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning as
soon as she was dressed and did not return till late in the evening </s>
<s> 
and the miss dashwoods at the particular request of the middletons
spent the whole of every day in conduit street </s>
<s>  for their own comfort
they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in <abvr>
jenningss house </s>
<s>  but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes
of everybody </s>
<s>  their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton and
the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact was as little
valued as it was professedly sought </s>
<s> 

they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former </s>
<s>  and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye as intruding on
their ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize </s>
<s> 
though nothing could be more polite than lady middletons behaviour to
elinor and marianne she did not really like them at all </s>
<s>   because they
neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them
goodnatured </s>
<s>  and because they were fond of reading she fancied them
satirical </s>
<s>  perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical </s>
<s> 
but that did not signify </s>
<s>   it was censure in common use and easily
given </s>
<s> 

their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy </s>
<s>   it checked the
idleness of one and the business of the other </s>
<s>   lady middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times she feared they would
despise her for offering </s>
<s>   miss steele was the least discomposed of the
three by their presence </s>
<s>  and it was in their power to reconcile her to
it entirely </s>
<s>   would either of them only have given her a full and
minute account of the whole affair between marianne and <abvr> willoughby
she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned </s>
<s> 
but this conciliation was not granted </s>
<s>  for though she often threw out
expressions of pity for her sister to elinor and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect was
produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in
the latter </s>
<s>   an effort even yet lighter might have made her their
friend </s>
<s>   would they only have laughed at her about the doctor </s>
<s>   but so
little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that
if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kind
enough to bestow on herself </s>
<s> 

all these jealousies and discontents however were so totally
unsuspected by <abvr> jennings that she thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together </s>
<s>  and generally congratulated her young
friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long </s>
<s>   she joined them sometimes at sir johns sometimes at
her own house </s>
<s>  but wherever it was she always came in excellent
spirits full of delight and importance attributing charlottes well
doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail
of her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire </s>
<s> 
one thing did disturb her </s>
<s>  and of that she made her daily complaint </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  palmer maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sex
of all infants being alike </s>
<s>  and though she could plainly perceive at
different times the most striking resemblance between this baby and
every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his
father of it </s>
<s>  no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like
every other baby of the same age </s>
<s>  nor could he even be brought to
acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
world </s>
<s> 

i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time
befell <abvr> john dashwood </s>
<s>   it so happened that while her two sisters
with <abvr> jennings were first calling on her in harley street another
of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her </s>
<s>   but while the imaginations
of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances ones happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance </s>
<s>   in the present
instance this lastarrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss
dashwoods and understanding them to be <abvr> dashwoods sisters she
immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street </s>
<s>  and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister to a small
musical party at her house </s>
<s>   the consequence of which was that <abvr>
john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what
was still worse must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention </s>
<s>  and who could tell that they might not
expect to go out with her a second time </s>
<s>   the power of disappointing
them it was true must always be hers </s>
<s>   but that was not enough </s>
<s>  for
when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
them </s>
<s> 

marianne had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit of
going out every day that it was become a matter of indifference to
her whether she went or not </s>
<s>  and she prepared quietly and mechanically
for every evenings engagement though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last
moment where it was to take her </s>
<s> 

to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent as
not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her
toilet which it received from miss steele in the first five minutes of
their being together when it was finished </s>
<s>   nothing escaped her minute
observation and general curiosity </s>
<s>  she saw every thing and asked every
thing </s>
<s>  was never easy till she knew the price of every part of
mariannes dress </s>
<s>  could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether
with better judgment than marianne herself and was not without hopes
of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself </s>
<s>   the
impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover was generally
concluded with a compliment which though meant as its douceur was
considered by marianne as the greatest impertinence of all </s>
<s>  for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the
colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair she was almost
sure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart and she
dared to say she would make a great many conquests </s>
<s> 

with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present
occasion to her brothers carriage </s>
<s>  which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sisterinlaw who had preceded them to the house of
her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman </s>
<s> 

the events of this evening were not very remarkable </s>
<s>   the party like
other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at all </s>
<s> 
and the performers themselves were as usual in their own estimation
and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in
england </s>
<s> 

as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so she made no
scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it
suited her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and
violoncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room </s>
<s>   in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of
young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpickcases
at grays </s>
<s>   she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and
speaking familiarly to her brother </s>
<s>  and had just determined to find out
his name from the latter when they both came towards her and <abvr>
dashwood introduced him to her as <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s> 

he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow
which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was
exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy </s>
<s>   happy
had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his
own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations </s>
<s>   for then his
brothers bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
illhumour of his mother and sister would have begun </s>
<s>   but while she
wondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find that
the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other </s>
<s>   why they were different robert
exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hours
conversation </s>
<s>  for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme
gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper
society he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education </s>
<s> 
while he himself though probably without any particular any material
superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man </s>
<s> 

upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more </s>
<s>  and so i often
tell my mother when she is grieving about it </s>
<s>   my dear madam i
always say to her you must make yourself easy </s>
<s>   the evil is now
irremediable and it has been entirely your own doing </s>
<s>   why would you
be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to
place edward under private tuition at the most critical time of his
life </s>
<s>   if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself
instead of sending him to <abvr> pratts all this would have been
prevented </s>
<s>  this is the way in which i always consider the matter and
my mother is perfectly convinced of her error </s>
<s> 

elinor would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be her
general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not
think of edwards abode in <abvr> pratts family with any satisfaction </s>
<s> 

you reside in devonshire i thinkwas his next observation in a
cottage near dawlish </s>
<s> 

elinor set him right as to its situation </s>
<s>  and it seemed rather
surprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire without living
near dawlish </s>
<s>   he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their
species of house </s>
<s> 

for my own part said he i am excessively fond of a cottage </s>
<s>  there
is always so much comfort so much elegance about them </s>
<s>   and i protest
if i had any money to spare i should buy a little land and build one
myself within a short distance of london where i might drive myself
down at any time and collect a few friends about me and be happy </s>
<s>   i
advise every body who is going to build to build a cottage </s>
<s>   my friend
lord courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice
and laid before me three different plans of bonomis </s>
<s>   i was to decide
on the best of them </s>
<s>   my dear courtland said i immediately throwing
them all into the fire do not adopt either of them but by all means
build a cottage </s>
<s>  and that i fancy will be the end of it </s>
<s> 

some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space in a
cottage </s>
<s>  but this is all a mistake </s>
<s>   i was last month at my friend
elliotts near dartford </s>
<s>   lady elliott wished to give a dance </s>
<s>   but
how can it be done </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  my dear ferrars do tell me how it is
to be managed </s>
<s>   there is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
couple and where can the supper be </s>
<s>  i immediately saw that there
could be no difficulty in it so i said my dear lady elliott do not
be uneasy </s>
<s>   the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease </s>
<s> 
cardtables may be placed in the drawingroom </s>
<s>  the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments </s>
<s>  and let the supper be set out in the
saloon </s>
<s>   lady elliott was delighted with the thought </s>
<s>   we measured the
diningroom and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan </s>
<s>   so that in fact you
see if people do but know how to set about it every comfort may be as
well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling </s>
<s> 

elinor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the
compliment of rational opposition </s>
<s> 

as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister
his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else </s>
<s>  and a thought
struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for
her approbation when they got home </s>
<s>   the consideration of <abvr>
dennisons mistake in supposing his sisters their guests had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such
while <abvr> jenningss engagements kept her from home </s>
<s>   the expense would
be nothing the inconvenience not more </s>
<s>  and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his
father </s>
<s>   fanny was startled at the proposal </s>
<s> 

i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting lady
middleton for they spend every day with her </s>
<s>  otherwise i should be
exceedingly glad to do it </s>
<s>   you know i am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews </s>
<s>   but
they are lady middletons visitors </s>
<s>   how can i ask them away from her </s>
<s> 

her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her
objection </s>
<s>   they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit
street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations </s>
<s> 

fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said

my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power </s>
<s> 
but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a
few days with us </s>
<s>   they are very well behaved good kind of girls </s>
<s>  and
i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well
by edward </s>
<s>   we can ask your sisters some other year you know </s>
<s>  but the
miss steeles may not be in town any more </s>
<s>   i am sure you will like
them </s>
<s>  indeed you do like them you know very much already and so
does my mother </s>
<s>  and they are such favourites with harry </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwood was convinced </s>
<s>   he saw the necessity of inviting the miss
steeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his sisters another year </s>
<s>  at the same time however slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by
bringing elinor to town as colonel brandons wife and marianne as
their visitor </s>
<s> 

fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it wrote the next morning to lucy to request her company and
her sisters for some days in harley street as soon as lady
middleton could spare them </s>
<s>   this was enough to make lucy really and
reasonably happy </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood seemed actually working for her
herself </s>
<s>  cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views </s>
<s>   such
an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all
things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the
most gratifying to her feelings </s>
<s>   it was an advantage that could not be
too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of </s>
<s>  and the
visit to lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits
was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days
time </s>
<s> 

when the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival it gave her for the first time some share in the
expectations of lucy </s>
<s>  for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwill
towards her arose from something more than merely malice against
herself </s>
<s>  and might be brought by time and address to do every thing
that lucy wished </s>
<s>   her flattery had already subdued the pride of lady
middleton and made an entry into the close heart of <abvr> john
dashwood </s>
<s>  and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater </s>
<s> 

the miss steeles removed to harley street and all that reached elinor
of their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event </s>
<s> 
sir john who called on them more than once brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in as must be universally striking </s>
<s>   <abvr>
dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her
life as she was with them </s>
<s>  had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant </s>
<s>  called lucy by her christian name </s>
<s>  and did not know
whether she should ever be able to part with them </s>

chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother felt
it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her </s>
<s>  and
contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from
that period to her own home and her own habits in which she found the
miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share </s>
<s> 

about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
berkeley street <abvr> jennings on returning from her ordinary visit to
mrs </s>
<s>  palmer entered the drawingroom where elinor was sitting by
herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to
hear something wonderful </s>
<s>  and giving her time only to form that idea
began directly to justify it by saying

lord </s>
<s>  my dear miss dashwood </s>
<s>  have you heard the news </s>
<s> 

no maam </s>
<s>   what is it </s>
<s> 

something so strange </s>
<s>   but you shall hear it all </s>
<s>  when i got to <abvr>
palmers i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child </s>
<s>   she was
sure it was very illit cried and fretted and was all over pimples </s>
<s> 
so i looked at it directly and lord </s>
<s>  my dear says i it is
nothing in the world but the red gum and nurse said just the same </s>
<s> 
but charlotte she would not be satisfied so <abvr> donavan was sent for </s>
<s> 
and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he
stepped over directly and as soon as ever mama he said
just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and
then charlotte was easy </s>
<s>   and so just as he was going away again it
came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of
it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news </s>
<s>   so upon
that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know
something or other and at last he said in a whisper for fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sisters indisposition i think it advisable to say that i
believe there is no great reason for alarm </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> dashwood will
do very well </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  is fanny ill </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i said my dear </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  says i is <abvr>
dashwood ill </s>
<s>  so then it all came out </s>
<s>  and the long and the short of
the matter by all i can learn seems to be this </s>
<s>   <abvr> edward ferrars
the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it
turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it <abvr>
edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
cousin lucy </s>
<s> theres for you my dear </s>
<s> and not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter except nancy </s>
<s> could you have believed such a
thing possible </s>
<s>  there is no great wonder in their liking one another </s>
<s> 
but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody
suspect it </s>
<s> that is strange </s>
<s> i never happened to see them together
or i am sure i should have found it out directly </s>
<s>   well and so this
was kept a great secret for fear of <abvr> ferrars and neither she nor
your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter </s>
<s> till this very
morning poor nancy who you know is a wellmeaning creature but no
conjurer popt it all out </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  thinks she to herself they are
all so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it </s>
<s> 
and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her
carpetwork little suspecting what was to comefor she had just been
saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to
make a match between edward and some lords daughter or other i forget
who </s>
<s>   so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride </s>
<s> 
she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as
reached your brothers ears as he was sitting in his own dressingroom
down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the
country </s>
<s>   so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for
lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on </s>
<s> 
poor soul </s>
<s>   i pity her </s>
<s>   and i must say i think she was used very
hardly </s>
<s>  for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into
a fainting fit </s>
<s>   nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly </s>
<s> 
and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know
what to do </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood declared they should not stay a minute
longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his
knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up
their clothes </s>
<s>   then she fell into hysterics again and he was so
frightened that he would send for <abvr> donavan and <abvr> donavan found
the house in all this uproar </s>
<s>   the carriage was at the door ready to
take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came
off </s>
<s>  poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk </s>
<s>  and
nancy she was almost as bad </s>
<s>   i declare i have no patience with your
sister </s>
<s>  and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of
her </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s>  what a taking poor <abvr> edward will be in when he hears of
it </s>
<s>   to have his love used so scornfully </s>
<s>  for they say he is monstrous
fond of her as well he may </s>
<s>   i should not wonder if he was to be in
the greatest passion </s>
<s> and <abvr> donavan thinks just the same </s>
<s>   he and i
had a great deal of talk about it </s>
<s>  and the best of all is that he is
gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when <abvr>
ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins
left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too </s>
<s> 
and so she may for what i care </s>
<s>   i have no pity for either of them </s>
<s>   i
have no notion of peoples making such a todo about money and
greatness </s>
<s>   there is no reason on earth why <abvr> edward and lucy should
not marry </s>
<s>  for i am sure <abvr> ferrars may afford to do very well by her
son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than
any body how to make the most of every thing </s>
<s>  i dare say if <abvr>
ferrars would only allow him five hundred ayear she would make as
good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight </s>
<s>   lord </s>
<s> 
how snug they might live in such another cottage as yoursor a little
biggerwith two maids and two men </s>
<s>  and i believe i could help them to
a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit
them exactly </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> jennings ceased and as elinor had had time enough to collect
her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such
observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce </s>
<s> 
happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it </s>
<s>  that <abvr> jennings as she had of late often hoped might be the
case had ceased to imagine her at all attached to edward </s>
<s>  and happy
above all the rest in the absence of marianne she felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment and to give her judgment
as she believed with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it </s>
<s> 

she could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really
was </s>
<s>  though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and
lucy </s>
<s>   what <abvr> ferrars would say and do though there could not be a
doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear </s>
<s>  and still more anxious to
know how edward would conduct himself </s>
<s>   for him she felt much
compassion </s>
<s> for lucy very littleand it cost her some pains to
procure that little </s>
<s> for the rest of the party none at all </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> jennings could talk on no other subject elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing marianne for its discussion </s>
<s>   no time was to be
lost in undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truth
and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister or any
resentment against edward </s>
<s> 

elinors office was a painful one </s>
<s> she was going to remove what she
really believed to be her sisters chief consolationto give such
particulars of edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good
opinionand to make marianne by a resemblance in their situations
which to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own disappointment
over again </s>
<s>   but unwelcome as such a task must be it was necessary to
be done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it </s>
<s> 

she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings or to
represent herself as suffering much any otherwise than as the
selfcommand she had practised since her first knowledge of edwards
engagement might suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne </s>
<s> 
her narration was clear and simple </s>
<s>  and though it could not be given
without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor
impetuous grief </s>
<s> that belonged rather to the hearer for marianne
listened with horror and cried excessively </s>
<s>   elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her own distresses no less than in theirs </s>
<s>  and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure
of mind and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but
of imprudence was readily offered </s>
<s> 

but marianne for some time would give credit to neither </s>
<s>   edward seemed
a second willoughby </s>
<s>  and acknowledging as elinor did that she had
loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself </s>
<s>   as for
lucy steele she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man that she could not be persuaded
at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of
edward for her </s>
<s>   she would not even admit it to have been natural </s>
<s>  and
elinor left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only
could convince her a better knowledge of mankind </s>
<s> 

her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement and the length of time it had existed </s>
<s> mariannes
feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of
detail </s>
<s>  and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her
distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment </s>
<s>   the first
question on her side which led to farther particulars was

how long has this been known to you elinor </s>
<s>  has he written to you </s>
<s> 

i have known it these four months </s>
<s>   when lucy first came to barton
park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement </s>
<s> 

at these words mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment which her
lips could not utter </s>
<s>   after a pause of wonder she exclaimed

four months </s>
<s> have you known of this four months </s>
<s> 

elinor confirmed it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s> while attending me in all my misery has this been on your
heart </s>
<s> and i have reproached you for being happy </s>
<s> 

it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse </s>
<s> 

four months </s>
<s> cried marianne again </s>
<s> so calm </s>
<s> so cheerful </s>
<s> how
have you been supported </s>
<s> 

by feeling that i was doing my duty </s>
<s> my promise to lucy obliged me
to be secret </s>
<s>   i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of
the truth </s>
<s>  and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in
them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to
satisfy </s>
<s> 

marianne seemed much struck </s>
<s> 

i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother added
elinor </s>
<s>  and once or twice i have attempted it </s>
<s> but without betraying
my trust i never could have convinced you </s>
<s> 

four months </s>
<s> and yet you loved him </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but i did not love only him </s>
<s> and while the comfort of others was
dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt </s>
<s> 
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion </s>
<s>   i would not have
you suffer on my account </s>
<s>  for i assure you i no longer suffer
materially myself </s>
<s>   i have many things to support me </s>
<s>   i am not
conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my
own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther </s>
<s> 
i acquit edward of essential misconduct </s>
<s>   i wish him very happy </s>
<s>  and i
am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour
some regret in the end he must become so </s>
<s>   lucy does not want sense
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built </s>
<s> and
after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a
single and constant attachment and all that can be said of ones
happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not
meantit is not fitit is not possible that it should be so </s>
<s>  edward
will marry lucy </s>
<s>  he will marry a woman superior in person and
understanding to half her sex </s>
<s>  and time and habit will teach him to
forget that he ever thought another superior to her </s>
<s> 

if such is your way of thinking said marianne if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your
resolution your selfcommand are perhaps a little less to be
wondered at </s>
<s> they are brought more within my comprehension </s>
<s> 

i understand you </s>
<s> you do not suppose that i have ever felt much </s>
<s> for
four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature </s>
<s>  knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least </s>
<s>  it was told
meit was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose
prior engagement ruined all my prospects </s>
<s>  and told me as i thought
with triumph </s>
<s>  this persons suspicions therefore i have had to
oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most
deeply interested </s>
<s> and it has not been only once </s>
<s> i have had her
hopes and exultation to listen to again and again </s>
<s>  i have known
myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one
circumstance that could make me less desire the connection </s>
<s> nothing
has proved him unworthy </s>
<s>  nor has anything declared him indifferent to
me </s>
<s>  i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and
the insolence of his mother </s>
<s>  and have suffered the punishment of an
attachment without enjoying its advantages </s>
<s>  and all this has been
going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only
unhappiness </s>
<s>  if you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you
may suppose that i have suffered now </s>
<s>   the composure of mind with which
i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the
consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of
constant and painful exertion </s>
<s> they did not spring up of
themselves </s>
<s> they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first </s>
<s>  no
marianne </s>
<s> then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing
could have kept me entirelynot even what i owed to my dearest
friendsfrom openly shewing that i was very unhappy </s>
<s> 

marianne was quite subdued </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  elinor she cried you have made me hate myself for ever </s>
<s> how
barbarous have i been to you </s>
<s> you who have been my only comfort who
have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only
suffering for me </s>
<s> is this my gratitude </s>
<s> is this the only return i can
make you </s>
<s> because your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying
to do it away </s>
<s> 

the tenderest caresses followed this confession </s>
<s>   in such a frame of
mind as she was now in elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her
whatever promise she required </s>
<s>  and at her request marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness </s>
<s> to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her </s>
<s> and even to see edward himself if chance should bring
them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality </s>
<s>  these
were great concessions </s>
<s> but where marianne felt that she had injured
no reparation could be too much for her to make </s>
<s> 

she performed her promise of being discreet to admiration </s>
<s> she
attended to all that <abvr> jennings had to say upon the subject with an
unchanging complexion dissented from her in nothing and was heard
three times to say yes maam </s>
<s> she listened to her praise of lucy
with only moving from one chair to another and when <abvr> jennings
talked of edwards affection it cost her only a spasm in her
throat </s>
<s> such advances towards heroism in her sister made elinor feel
equal to any thing herself </s>
<s> 

the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their
brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair and bring them news of his wife </s>
<s> 

you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity as soon as
he was seated of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday </s>
<s> 

they all looked their assent </s>
<s>  it seemed too awful a moment for speech </s>
<s> 

your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars
tooin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut i
will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
quite overcome </s>
<s>   poor fanny </s>
<s>  she was in hysterics all yesterday </s>
<s>   but i
would not alarm you too much </s>
<s>   donavan says there is nothing materially
to be apprehended </s>
<s>  her constitution is a good one and her resolution
equal to any thing </s>
<s>   she has borne it all with the fortitude of an
angel </s>
<s>   she says she never shall think well of anybody again </s>
<s>  and one
cannot wonder at it after being so deceived </s>
<s> meeting with such
ingratitude where so much kindness had been shewn so much confidence
had been placed </s>
<s>   it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart
that she had asked these young women to her house </s>
<s>  merely because she
thought they deserved some attention were harmless wellbehaved
girls and would be pleasant companions </s>
<s>  for otherwise we both wished
very much to have invited you and marianne to be with us while your
kind friend there was attending her daughter </s>
<s>   and now to be so
rewarded </s>
<s>   i wish with all my heart says poor fanny in her
affectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead of them </s>
<s> 

here he stopped to be thanked </s>
<s>  which being done he went on </s>
<s> 

what poor <abvr> ferrars suffered when first fanny broke it to her is
not to be described </s>
<s>   while she with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him was it to be supposed that
he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person </s>
<s> such a
suspicion could never have entered her head </s>
<s>   if she suspected any
prepossession elsewhere it could not be in that quarter </s>
<s>   there to
be sure said she i might have thought myself safe </s>
<s>  she was quite
in an agony </s>
<s>   we consulted together however as to what should be
done and at last she determined to send for edward </s>
<s>   he came </s>
<s>   but i
am sorry to relate what ensued </s>
<s>   all that <abvr> ferrars could say to
make him put an end to the engagement assisted too as you may well
suppose by my arguments and fannys entreaties was of no avail </s>
<s> 
duty affection every thing was disregarded </s>
<s>   i never thought edward
so stubborn so unfeeling before </s>
<s>   his mother explained to him her
liberal designs in case of his marrying miss morton </s>
<s>  told him she
would settle on him the norfolk estate which clear of landtax
brings in a good thousand ayear </s>
<s>  offered even when matters grew
desperate to make it twelve hundred </s>
<s>  and in opposition to this if he
still persisted in this low connection represented to him the certain
penury that must attend the match </s>
<s>   his own two thousand pounds she
protested should be his all </s>
<s>  she would never see him again </s>
<s>  and so far
would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he
were to enter into any profession with a view of better support she
would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it </s>
<s> 

here marianne in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands
together and cried gracious god </s>
<s>   can this be possible </s>
<s> 

well may you wonder marianne replied her brother at the obstinacy
which could resist such arguments as these </s>
<s>   your exclamation is very
natural </s>
<s> 

marianne was going to retort but she remembered her promises and
forbore </s>
<s> 

all this however he continued was urged in vain </s>
<s>   edward said
very little </s>
<s>  but what he did say was in the most determined manner </s>
<s> 
nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement </s>
<s>   he would
stand to it cost him what it might </s>
<s> 

then cried <abvr> jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be
silent he has acted like an honest man </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon <abvr>
dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a
rascal </s>
<s>   i have some little concern in the business as well as
yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good
husband </s>
<s> 

john dashwood was greatly astonished </s>
<s>  but his nature was calm not open
to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially
anybody of good fortune </s>
<s>   he therefore replied without any resentment

i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours
madam </s>
<s>   miss lucy steele is i dare say a very deserving young woman
but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible </s>
<s> 
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her
uncles care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
as <abvr> ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary </s>
<s>  in
short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
you have a regard for <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>   we all wish her extremely happy </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> ferrarss conduct throughout the whole has been such as every
conscientious good mother in like circumstances would adopt </s>
<s>   it has
been dignified and liberal </s>
<s>   edward has drawn his own lot and i fear
it will be a bad one </s>
<s> 

marianne sighed out her similar apprehension </s>
<s>  and elinors heart wrung
for the feelings of edward while braving his mothers threats for a
woman who could not reward him </s>
<s> 

well sir said <abvr> jennings and how did it end </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to say maam in a most unhappy rupture </s>
<s>  edward is
dismissed for ever from his mothers notice </s>
<s>   he left her house
yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do
not know </s>
<s>  for we of course can make no inquiry </s>
<s> 

poor young man </s>
<s> and what is to become of him </s>
<s> 

what indeed maam </s>
<s>   it is a melancholy consideration </s>
<s>   born to the
prospect of such affluence </s>
<s>   i cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable </s>
<s>   the interest of two thousand poundshow can a man live on
it </s>
<s> and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for
his own folly within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand five hundred ayear for miss morton has thirty thousand
pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition </s>
<s>   we must
all feel for him </s>
<s>  and the more so because it is totally out of our
power to assist him </s>
<s> 

poor young man </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jennings i am sure he should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house </s>
<s>  and so i would tell him if i
could see him </s>
<s>   it is not fit that he should be living about at his own
charge now at lodgings and taverns </s>
<s> 

elinors heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though she
could not forbear smiling at the form of it </s>
<s> 

if he would only have done as well by himself said john dashwood
as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been
in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing </s>
<s>   but as it
is it must be out of anybodys power to assist him </s>
<s>   and there is one
thing more preparing against him which must be worse than allhis
mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle
that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edwards on
proper conditions </s>
<s>   i left her this morning with her lawyer talking
over the business </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jennings that is her revenge </s>
<s>   everybody has a way
of their own </s>
<s>   but i dont think mine would be to make one son
independent because another had plagued me </s>
<s> 

marianne got up and walked about the room </s>
<s> 

can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man continued john
than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might
have been his own </s>
<s>   poor edward </s>
<s>   i feel for him sincerely </s>
<s> 

a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion concluded his
visit </s>
<s>  and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really
believed there was no material danger in fannys indisposition and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away </s>
<s> 
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion as far at least as it regarded <abvr> ferrarss conduct the
dashwoods and edwards </s>
<s> 

mariannes indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room </s>
<s>  and
as her vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor and unnecessary in
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was very warm in her praise of edwards conduct but only
elinor and marianne understood its true merit </s>
<s>   they only knew how
little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was the
consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain
to him in the loss of friends and fortune </s>
<s>   elinor gloried in his
integrity </s>
<s>  and marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his
punishment </s>
<s>   but though confidence between them was by this public
discovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on which
either of them were fond of dwelling when alone </s>
<s>   elinor avoided it
upon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the
too warm too positive assurances of marianne that belief of edwards
continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away </s>
<s>  and
mariannes courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic
which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by the
comparison it necessarily produced between elinors conduct and her own </s>
<s> 

she felt all the force of that comparison </s>
<s>  but not as her sister had
hoped to urge her to exertion now </s>
<s>  she felt it with all the pain of
continual selfreproach regretted most bitterly that she had never
exerted herself before </s>
<s>  but it brought only the torture of penitence
without the hope of amendment </s>
<s>   her mind was so much weakened that she
still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only
dispirited her more </s>
<s> 

nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards of affairs
in harley street or bartletts buildings </s>
<s>   but though so much of the
matter was known to them already that <abvr> jennings might have had
enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after
more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and
inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could </s>
<s>  and nothing but the
hindrance of more visitors than usual had prevented her going to them
within that time </s>
<s> 

the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so
fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardens
though it was only the second week in march </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings and elinor
were of the number </s>
<s>  but marianne who knew that the willoughbys were
again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather
to stay at home than venture into so public a place </s>
<s> 

an intimate acquaintance of <abvr> jennings joined them soon after they
entered the gardens and elinor was not sorry that by her continuing
with them and engaging all <abvr> jenningss conversation she was
herself left to quiet reflection </s>
<s>   she saw nothing of the willoughbys
nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her </s>
<s>   but at last
she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele who
though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings left her own party for a short time to join theirs </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  jennings immediately whispered to elinor

get it all out of her my dear </s>
<s>   she will tell you any thing if you
ask </s>
<s>   you see i cannot leave <abvr> clarke </s>
<s> 

it was lucky however for <abvr> jenningss curiosity and elinors too
that she would tell any thing without being asked </s>
<s>  for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt </s>
<s> 

i am so glad to meet you </s>
<s>  said miss steele taking her familiarly by
the armfor i wanted to see you of all things in the world </s>
<s>   and
then lowering her voice i suppose <abvr> jennings has heard all about
it </s>
<s>   is she angry </s>
<s> 

not at all i believe with you </s>
<s> 

that is a good thing </s>
<s>   and lady middleton is she angry </s>
<s> 

i cannot suppose it possible that she should be </s>
<s> 

i am monstrous glad of it </s>
<s>   good gracious </s>
<s>   i have had such a time of
it </s>
<s>   i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life </s>
<s>   she vowed at first
she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me
again so long as she lived </s>
<s>  but now she is quite come to and we are
as good friends as ever </s>
<s>   look she made me this bow to my hat and put
in the feather last night </s>
<s>   there now you are going to laugh at me
too </s>
<s>   but why should not i wear pink ribbons </s>
<s>   i do not care if it is
the doctors favourite colour </s>
<s>   i am sure for my part i should never
have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not
happened to say so </s>
<s>   my cousins have been so plaguing me </s>
<s>   i declare
sometimes i do not know which way to look before them </s>
<s> 

she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to say
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to
the first </s>
<s> 

well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say what
they chuse about <abvr> ferrarss declaring he would not have lucy for it
is no such thing i can tell you </s>
<s>  and it is quite a shame for such
illnatured reports to be spread abroad </s>
<s>   whatever lucy might think
about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set
it down for certain </s>
<s> 

i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure you
said elinor </s>
<s> 

oh did not you </s>
<s>   but it was said i know very well and by more than
one </s>
<s>  for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could
expect <abvr> ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty
thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at
all </s>
<s>  and i had it from miss sparks myself </s>
<s>   and besides that my cousin
richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid <abvr>
ferrars would be off </s>
<s>  and when edward did not come near us for three
days i could not tell what to think myself </s>
<s>  and i believe in my heart
lucy gave it up all for lost </s>
<s>  for we came away from your brothers
wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and
saturday and did not know what was become of him </s>
<s>   once lucy thought
to write to him but then her spirits rose against that </s>
<s>   however this
morning he came just as we came home from church </s>
<s>  and then it all came
out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been
talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before
them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he
have </s>
<s>   and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as
he had went away from his mothers house he had got upon his horse
and rid into the country some where or other </s>
<s>  and how he had stayed
about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better
of it </s>
<s>   and after thinking it all over and over again he said it
seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it
would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must
be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no
hope of any thing else </s>
<s>  and if he was to go into orders as he had some
thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live
upon that </s>
<s> he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so
he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the
matter directly and leave him shift for himself </s>
<s>   i heard him say all
this as plain as could possibly be </s>
<s>   and it was entirely for her sake
and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon
his own </s>
<s>   i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired
of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it </s>
<s>   but
to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking </s>
<s>  so she
told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know
and all thatoh la </s>
<s>  one cant repeat such kind of things you
knowshe told him directly she had not the least mind in the world
to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so
ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know
or something of the kind </s>
<s>   so then he was monstrous happy and talked
on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take
orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living </s>
<s> 
and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from
below to tell me <abvr> richardson was come in her coach and would take
one of us to kensington gardens </s>
<s>  so i was forced to go into the room
and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did
not care to leave edward </s>
<s>  so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of
silk stockings and came off with the richardsons </s>
<s> 

i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinor </s>
<s> 
you were all in the same room together were not you </s>
<s> 

no indeed not us </s>
<s>   la </s>
<s>  miss dashwood do you think people make love
when any body else is by </s>
<s>   oh for shame </s>
<s> to be sure you must know
better than that </s>
<s>   laughing affectedly </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s>  they were shut up in
the drawingroom together and all i heard was only by listening at the
door </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s>  cried elinor </s>
<s>  have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door </s>
<s>   i am sorry i did not know it
before </s>
<s>  for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself </s>
<s>   how could you behave so unfairly by your sister </s>
<s> 

oh la </s>
<s>  there is nothing in that </s>
<s>   i only stood at the door and heard
what i could </s>
<s>   and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me </s>
<s> 
for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets
together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a
chimneyboard on purpose to hear what we said </s>
<s> 

elinor tried to talk of something else </s>
<s>  but miss steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind </s>
<s> 

edward talks of going to oxford soon said she </s>
<s>  but now he is
lodging at no </s>
<s>   pall mall </s>
<s>   what an illnatured woman his mother is
ant she </s>
<s>  and your brother and sister were not very kind </s>
<s>  however i
shant say anything against them to you </s>
<s>  and to be sure they did send
us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for </s>
<s>   and
for my part i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us
for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before </s>
<s>  but however
nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight </s>
<s> 
edward have got some business at oxford he says </s>
<s>  so he must go there
for a time </s>
<s>  and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he
will be ordained </s>
<s>   i wonder what curacy he will get </s>
<s> good gracious </s>
<s> 
giggling as she spoke id lay my life i know what my cousins will
say when they hear of it </s>
<s>   they will tell me i should write to the
doctor to get edward the curacy of his new living </s>
<s>   i know they will </s>
<s> 
but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world </s>
<s>  la </s>
<s>  i
shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a thing </s>
<s>   i
write to the doctor indeed </s>
<s> 

well said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst </s>
<s> 
you have got your answer ready </s>
<s> 

miss steele was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of
her own party made another more necessary </s>
<s> 

oh la </s>
<s>  here come the richardsons </s>
<s>   i had a vast deal more to say to

such was her parting concern </s>
<s>  for after this she had time only to pay
her farewell compliments to <abvr> jennings before her company was
claimed by <abvr> richardson </s>
<s>  and elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though
she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
foreplanned in her own mind </s>
<s>   edwards marriage with lucy was as firmly
determined on and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
uncertain as she had concluded it would be </s>
<s> every thing depended
exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment of

<s> 

as soon as they returned to the carriage <abvr> jennings was eager for
information </s>
<s>  but as elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she
confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as
she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would
choose to have known </s>
<s>   the continuance of their engagement and the
means that were able to be taken for promoting its end was all her
communication </s>

natural remark </s>

<s> ay we all know how that will
end </s>
<s> they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it

chapter 


the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town
and mariannes impatience to be gone increased every day </s>
<s>   she sighed
for the air the liberty the quiet of the country </s>
<s>  and fancied that if
any place could give her ease barton must do it </s>
<s>   elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey which marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge </s>
<s>   she began however seriously to turn her thoughts
towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her
goodwill when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer appeared to elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other </s>
<s>  the palmers were to remove to cleveland about
the end of march for the easter holidays </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings with both
her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with
them </s>
<s>   this would not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy
of miss dashwood </s>
<s> but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
mr </s>
<s>  palmer himself as joined to the very great amendment of his
manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy
induced her to accept it with pleasure </s>
<s> 

when she told marianne what she had done however her first reply was
not very auspicious </s>
<s> 

cleveland </s>
<s> she cried with great agitation </s>
<s>   no i cannot go to
cleveland </s>
<s> 

you forget said elinor gently that its situation is not </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that it
is not in the neighbourhood of </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

but it is in somersetshire </s>
<s> i cannot go into somersetshire </s>
<s> there
where i looked forward to going </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> no elinor you cannot expect me to
go there </s>
<s> 

elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings </s>
<s> she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others </s>
<s> represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the
time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to
see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan
could do and perhaps without any greater delay </s>
<s>   from cleveland which
was within a few miles of bristol the distance to barton was not
beyond one day though a long days journey </s>
<s>  and their mothers servant
might easily come there to attend them down </s>
<s>  and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks time </s>
<s>   as mariannes affection
for her mother was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty
over the imaginary evils she had started </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was so far from being weary of her guests that she
pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from cleveland </s>
<s> 
elinor was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her
design </s>
<s>  and their mothers concurrence being readily gained every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be </s>
<s> and
marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her from barton </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss
dashwoods </s>
<s> was <abvr> jenningss address to him when he first called on
her after their leaving her was settledfor they are quite resolved
upon going home from the palmers </s>
<s> and how forlorn we shall be when i
come back </s>
<s> lord </s>
<s>  we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
cats </s>
<s> 

perhaps <abvr> jennings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give
himself an escape from it </s>
<s> and if so she had soon afterwards good
reason to think her object gained </s>
<s>  for on elinors moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print which she
was going to copy for her friend he followed her to it with a look of
particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes </s>
<s> 
the effect of his discourse on the lady too could not escape her
observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even
changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear to one close by
the piano forte on which marianne was playing she could not keep
herself from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with
agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her
employment </s>
<s>  still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the
interval of mariannes turning from one lesson to another some words
of the colonels inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his house </s>
<s>   this set the matter beyond a
doubt </s>
<s>   she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do so </s>
<s> 
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette </s>
<s>   what elinor said in reply
she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that
she did not think that any material objection </s>
<s> and <abvr> jennings
commended her in her heart for being so honest </s>
<s>   they then talked on
for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another
lucky stop in mariannes performance brought her these words in the
colonels calm voice

i am afraid it cannot take place very soon </s>
<s> 

astonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech she was almost
ready to cry out lord </s>
<s>  what should hinder it </s>
<s> but checking her
desire confined herself to this silent ejaculation </s>
<s> 

this is very strange </s>
<s> sure he need not wait to be older </s>
<s> 

this delay on the colonels side however did not seem to offend or
mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards and moving different ways <abvr> jennings
very plainly heard elinor say and with a voice which shewed her to
feel what she said

i shall always think myself very much obliged to you </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings was delighted with her gratitude and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence the colonel should be able to take leave
of them as he immediately did with the utmost sangfroid and go away
without making her any reply </s>
<s> she had not thought her old friend could
have made so indifferent a suitor </s>
<s> 

what had really passed between them was to this effect </s>
<s> 

i have heard said he with great compassion of the injustice your
friend <abvr> ferrars has suffered from his family </s>
<s>  for if i understand
the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his engagement with a very deserving young woman </s>
<s>  have i been
rightly informed </s>
<s> is it so </s>
<s> 

elinor told him that it was </s>
<s> 

the cruelty the impolitic crueltyhe replied with great
feelingof dividing or attempting to divide two young people long
attached to each other is terrible </s>
<s>  <abvr> ferrars does not know what
she may be doingwhat she may drive her son to </s>
<s>   i have seen <abvr>
ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with
him </s>
<s>   he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
in a short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his
own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more </s>
<s>   i understand
that he intends to take orders </s>
<s>   will you be so good as to tell him
that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this
days post is his if he think it worth his acceptancebut that
perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be
nonsense to appear to doubt </s>
<s>  i only wish it were more  valuable </s>
<s>  it
is a rectory but a small one </s>
<s>  the late incumbent i believe did not
make more than  l per annum and though it is certainly capable of
improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very
comfortable income </s>
<s>   such as it is however my pleasure in presenting
it to him will be very great </s>
<s>   pray assure him of it </s>
<s> 

elinors astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand </s>
<s> 
the preferment which only two days before she had considered as
hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to marry </s>
<s> and
she of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it </s>
<s> her
emotion was such as <abvr> jennings had attributed to a very different
cause </s>
<s> but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might
have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence
and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together
prompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmly
expressed </s>
<s>   she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke of
edwards principles and disposition with that praise which she knew
them to deserve </s>
<s>  and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another </s>
<s>   but at the same time she could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself </s>
<s>   it was an office in short
from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared
herself </s>
<s>  but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy declining
it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her
means that she would not on any account make farther opposition </s>
<s> 
edward she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heard
his address from miss steele </s>
<s>   she could undertake therefore to inform
him of it in the course of the day </s>
<s>   after this had been settled
colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that he
mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent </s>
<s> an
evil which elinor as <abvr> jennings had supposed her to do made very
light of at least as far as regarded its size </s>
<s> 

the smallness of the house said she i cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and
income </s>
<s> 

by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering <abvr>
ferrarss marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation </s>
<s>  for
he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such
an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle
onand he said so </s>
<s> 

this little rectory can do no more than make <abvr> ferrars comfortable
as a bachelor </s>
<s>  it cannot enable him to marry </s>
<s>   i am sorry to say that
my patronage ends with this </s>
<s>  and my interest is hardly more extensive </s>
<s> 
if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do
if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i
could be at present </s>
<s>   what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all
since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal
his only object of happiness </s>
<s>   his marriage must still be a distant
good </s>
<s> at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon </s>
<s> 

such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the
delicate feelings of <abvr> jennings </s>
<s>  but after this narration of what
really passed between colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at
the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may
perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage </s>

chapter 


well miss dashwood said <abvr> jennings sagaciously smiling as soon
as the gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel has
been saying to you </s>
<s>  for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of
hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business </s>
<s> 
and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life and i wish you
joy of it with all my heart </s>
<s> 

thank you maam said elinor </s>
<s>   it is a matter of great joy to me </s>
<s> 
and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly </s>
<s>   there are
not many men who would act as he has done </s>
<s>   few people who have so
compassionate a heart </s>
<s>   i never was more astonished in my life </s>
<s> 

lord </s>
<s>  my dear you are very modest </s>
<s>   i ant the least astonished at it
in the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more
likely to happen </s>
<s> 

you judged from your knowledge of the colonels general benevolence </s>
<s> 
but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
soon occur </s>
<s> 

opportunity </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> jenningsoh </s>
<s>  as to that when a man has
once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon
find an opportunity </s>
<s>   well my dear i wish you joy of it again and
again </s>
<s>  and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i
shall soon know where to look for them </s>
<s> 

you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose said elinor with a
faint smile </s>
<s> 

aye my dear that i do indeed </s>
<s>   and as to the house being a bad one
i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as
ever i saw </s>
<s> 

he spoke of its being out of repair </s>
<s> 

well and whose fault is that </s>
<s>  why dont he repair it </s>
<s> who should do
it but himself </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the
carriage being at the door </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings immediately preparing to
go said

well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out </s>
<s> 
but however we may have it all over in the evening </s>
<s>  for we shall be
quite alone </s>
<s>   i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind
is too full of the matter to care for company </s>
<s>  and besides you must
long to tell your sister all about it </s>
<s> 

marianne had left the room before the conversation began </s>
<s> 

certainly maam i shall tell marianne of it </s>
<s>  but i shall not mention
it at present to any body else </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  very well said <abvr> jennings rather disappointed </s>
<s>   then you
would not have me tell it to lucy for i think of going as far as
holborn today </s>
<s> 

no maam not even lucy if you please </s>
<s>   one days delay will not be
very material </s>
<s>  and till i have written to <abvr> ferrars i think it ought
not to be mentioned to any body else </s>
<s>   i shall do that directly </s>
<s>   it is
of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of
course have much to do relative to his ordination </s>
<s> 

this speech at first puzzled <abvr> jennings exceedingly </s>
<s>   why <abvr>
ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry she could
not immediately comprehend </s>
<s>   a few moments reflection however
produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed </s>
<s> 

oh ho </s>
<s> i understand you </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is to be the man </s>
<s>   well so
much the better for him </s>
<s>   ay to be sure he must be ordained in
readiness </s>
<s>  and i am very glad to find things are so forward between
you </s>
<s>   but my dear is not this rather out of character </s>
<s>   should not
the colonel write himself </s>
<s> sure he is the proper person </s>
<s> 

elinor did not quite understand the beginning of <abvr> jenningss
speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into </s>
<s>  and therefore
only replied to its conclusion </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to
announce his intentions to <abvr> ferrars than himself </s>
<s> 

and so you are forced to do it </s>
<s>   well that is an odd kind of delicacy </s>
<s> 
however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write </s>
<s>   you
know your own concerns best </s>
<s>   so goodby my dear </s>
<s>   i have not heard of
any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed </s>
<s> 

and away she went </s>
<s>  but returning again in a moment

i have just been thinking of bettys sister my dear </s>
<s>   i should be
very glad to get her so good a mistress </s>
<s>   but whether she would do for
a ladys maid i am sure i cant tell </s>
<s>   she is an excellent housemaid
and works very well at her needle </s>
<s>   however you will think of all that
at your leisure </s>
<s> 

certainly maam replied elinor not hearing much of what she said
and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject </s>
<s> 

how she should beginhow she should express herself in her note to
edward was now all her concern </s>
<s>   the particular circumstances between
them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
been the easiest thing in the world </s>
<s>  but she equally feared to say too
much or too little and sat deliberating over her paper with the pen
in her hand till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself </s>
<s> 

he had met <abvr> jennings at the door in her way to the carriage as he
came to leave his farewell card </s>
<s>  and she after apologising for not
returning herself had obliged him to enter by saying that miss
dashwood was above and wanted to speak with him on very particular
business </s>
<s> 

elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her
perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her
upon this greatest exertion of all </s>
<s>   her astonishment and confusion
were very great on his so sudden appearance </s>
<s>   she had not seen him
before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his
knowing her to be acquainted with it </s>
<s>  which with the consciousness of
what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes </s>
<s>   he too was much
distressed </s>
<s>  and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment </s>
<s> whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on
first coming into the room he could not recollect </s>
<s>  but determining to
be on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he could
say any thing after taking a chair </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  jennings told me said he that you wished to speak with me at
least i understood her soor i certainly should not have intruded on
you in such a manner </s>
<s>  though at the same time i should have been
extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister </s>
<s> 
especially as it will most likely be some timeit is not probable that
i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again </s>
<s>   i go to oxford
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself
and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as
possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been
able to give them in person </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings was quite right in what she
said </s>
<s>   i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on
the point of communicating by paper </s>
<s>   i am charged with a most
agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke </s>
<s> 
colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to
say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure
in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes
it were more valuable </s>
<s>   allow me to congratulate you on having so
respectable and welljudging a friend and to join in his wish that the
livingit is about two hundred ayearwere much more considerable
and such as might better enable you toas might be more than a
temporary accommodation to yourselfsuch in short as might establish
all your views of happiness </s>
<s> 

what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected
that any one else should say for him </s>
<s>   he looked all the astonishment
which such unexpected such unthoughtof information could not fail of
exciting </s>
<s>  but he said only these two words

colonel brandon </s>
<s> 

yes continued elinor gathering more resolution as some of the
worst was over colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern
for what has lately passedfor the cruel situation in which the
unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed youa concern which i
am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share </s>
<s>  and
likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and
his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon give me a living </s>
<s> can it be possible </s>
<s> 

the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
friendship any where </s>
<s> 

no replied he with sudden consciousness not to find it in you </s>
<s> 
for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it
all </s>
<s> i feel iti would express it if i couldbut as you well know
i am no orator </s>
<s> 

you are very much mistaken </s>
<s>   i do assure you that you owe it entirely
at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandons
discernment of it </s>
<s>   i have had no hand in it </s>
<s>   i did not even know
till i understood his design that the living was vacant </s>
<s>  nor had it
ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift </s>
<s> 
as a friend of mine of my family he may perhapsindeed i know he
has still greater pleasure in bestowing it </s>
<s>  but upon my word you owe
nothing to my solicitation </s>
<s> 

truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but
she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation </s>
<s>  which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently
entered it </s>
<s>   for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had
ceased to speak </s>
<s> at last and as if it were rather an effort he said

colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability </s>
<s>   i have
always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him
highly </s>
<s>   he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly
the gentleman </s>
<s> 

indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him on farther
acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be
such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost
close to the mansionhouse it is particularly important that he
should be all this </s>
<s> 

edward made no answer </s>

that </s>
<s> 

really said elinor i know so little of these kind of forms that i
can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation

ordination </s>

two or three months </s>

you talk of it </s>

bless me </s>

the deception could not continue after this </s>

aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she after the first
ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may
be out of repair </s>

you too that had been used to live in barton cottage </s>

ridiculous </s>

thing to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy
goes to it </s>

being enough to allow them to marry </s>

the colonel is a ninny my dear </s>

chapter 


edward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with
his happiness to lucy </s>
<s>  and such was the excess of it by the time he
reached bartletts buildings that she was able to assure <abvr>
jennings who called on her again the next day with her
congratulations that she had never seen him in such spirits before in
her life </s>
<s> 

her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain </s>
<s>  and
she joined <abvr> jennings most heartily in her expectation of their
being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas </s>
<s> 
so far was she at the same time from any backwardness to give elinor
that credit which edward would give her that she spoke of her
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to
own all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on miss dashwoods part either present or future would
ever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she really valued </s>
<s>   as for colonel brandon she was
not only ready to worship him as a saint but was moreover truly
anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns </s>
<s> 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost </s>
<s>  and scarcely
resolved to avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly could
of his servants his carriage his cows and his poultry </s>
<s> 

it was now above a week since john dashwood had called in berkeley
street and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his
wifes indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her a visit </s>
<s> this was an obligation however
which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her companions </s>
<s>   marianne not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to
prevent her sisters going at all </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jennings though her
carriage was always at elinors service so very much disliked <abvr>
john dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after
the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking
edwards part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company
again </s>
<s>   the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run
the risk of a teteatete with a woman whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was denied </s>
<s>  but before the carriage could turn from the
house her husband accidentally came out </s>
<s>   he expressed great pleasure
in meeting elinor told her that he had been just going to call in
berkeley street and assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see
her invited her to come in </s>

they walked up stairs in to the drawingroom </s>

world to seeing you </s>

favourites </s>

elinor made what excuse she could for her </s>

i am not sorry to see you alone he replied for i have a good deal
to say to you </s>

coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it </s>

it is perfectly true </s>
<s> colonel brandon has given the living of
delaford to edward </s>
<s> 

really </s>
<s> well this is very astonishing </s>
<s> no relationship </s>
<s> no
connection between them </s>
<s> and now that livings fetch such a
price </s>
<s> what was the value of this </s>
<s> 

about two hundred a year </s>
<s> 

very welland for the next presentation to a living of that
valuesupposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and
likely to vacate it soonhe might have got i dare sayfourteen
hundred pounds </s>
<s>   and how came he not to have settled that matter before
this persons death </s>
<s> now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a
man of colonel brandons sense </s>
<s> i wonder he should be so improvident
in a point of such common such natural concern </s>
<s> well i am convinced
that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
character </s>
<s>   i suppose howeveron recollectionthat the case may
probably be this </s>
<s>   edward is only to hold the living till the person to
whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to
take it </s>
<s> aye aye that is the fact depend upon it </s>
<s> 

elinor contradicted it however very positively </s>
<s>  and by relating that
she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel
brandon to edward and therefore must understand the terms on which
it was given obliged him to submit to her authority </s>
<s> 

it is truly astonishing </s>
<s> he cried after hearing what she
saidwhat could be the colonels motive </s>
<s> 

a very simple oneto be of use to <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky
man </s>
<s> you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though i
have broke it to her and she bears it vastly wellshe will not like
to hear it much talked of </s>
<s> 

elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she
thought fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth
to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly
impoverished </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject knows nothing about it at present and i believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may
be </s>
<s>  when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all </s>
<s> 

but why should such precaution be used </s>
<s> though it is not to be
supposed that <abvr> ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her son has money enough to live uponfor that must be
quite out of the question </s>
<s>  yet why upon her late behaviour is she
supposed to feel at all </s>
<s> she has done with her son she cast him off
for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast
him off likewise </s>
<s>   surely after doing so she cannot be imagined
liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his accountshe cannot
be interested in any thing that befalls him </s>
<s>  she would not be so weak
as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of
a parent </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  elinor said john your reasoning is very good but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature </s>
<s>   when edwards unhappy match
takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had
never discarded him </s>
<s>  and therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as
possible </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars can never forget that edward is her son </s>
<s> 

you surprise me </s>
<s>  i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory
by this time </s>
<s> 

you wrong her exceedingly </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world </s>
<s> 

elinor was silent </s>
<s> 

we think nowsaid <abvr> dashwood after a short pause of roberts
marrying miss morton </s>
<s> 

elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brothers
tone calmly replied

the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair </s>
<s> 

choice </s>
<s> how do you mean </s>
<s> 

i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be
the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert </s>
<s> 

certainly there can be no difference </s>
<s>  for robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son </s>
<s> and as to any
thing else they are both very agreeable young men </s>
<s>  i do not know that
one is superior to the other </s>
<s> 

elinor said no more and john was also for a short time silent </s>
<s> his
reflections ended thus </s>
<s> 

of one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand and speaking in
an awful whisperi may assure you </s>
<s> and i will do it because i know
it must gratify you </s>
<s>   i have good reason to thinkindeed i have it
from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut i have it from the
very best authoritynot that i ever precisely heard <abvr> ferrars say
it herselfbut her daughter did and i have it from herthat in
short whatever objections there might be against a certaina certain
connectionyou understand meit would have been far preferable to
her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does </s>
<s>   i
was exceedingly pleased to hear that <abvr> ferrars considered it in that
lighta very gratifying circumstance you know to us all </s>
<s>   it would
have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and
she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse </s>
<s>  but however all
that is quite out of the questionnot to be thought of or
mentionedas to any attachment you knowit never could beall that
is gone by </s>
<s>   but i thought i would just tell you of this because i
knew how much it must please you </s>
<s>   not that you have any reason to
regret my dear elinor </s>
<s>   there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
wellquite as well or better perhaps all things considered </s>
<s>   has
colonel brandon been with you lately </s>
<s> 

elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her
selfimportance to agitate her nerves and fill her mind </s>
<s> and she was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her
brother by the entrance of <abvr> robert ferrars </s>
<s>   after a few moments
chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of her
sisters being there quitted the room in quest of her </s>
<s>  and elinor was
left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay
unconcern the happy selfcomplacency of his manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his mothers love and liberality to the prejudice
of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of
life and that brothers integrity was confirming her most
unfavourable opinion of his head and heart </s>
<s> 

they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to
speak of edward </s>
<s>  for he too had heard of the living and was very
inquisitive on the subject </s>
<s>   elinor repeated the particulars of it as
she had given them to john </s>
<s>  and their effect on robert though very
different was not less striking than it had been on him </s>
<s>   he laughed
most immoderately </s>
<s>   the idea of edwards being a clergyman and living
in a small parsonagehouse diverted him beyond measure </s>
<s> and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of edward reading prayers in a
white surplice and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith
and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous </s>
<s> 

elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the
conclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed
on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited </s>
<s>   it was a
look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings
and gave no intelligence to him </s>
<s>   he was recalled from wit to wisdom
not by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility </s>
<s> 

we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
of the momentbut upon my soul it is a most serious business </s>
<s>   poor
edward </s>
<s>   he is ruined for ever </s>

know him to be a very goodhearted creature </s>

upon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom </s>

and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life as
when it all burst forth </s>
<s>   i could not believe it </s>
<s>  my mother was the
first person who told me of it </s>
<s>  and i feeling myself called on to act
with resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know
what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must
say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him
again </s>
<s>  that was what i said immediately </s>
<s>  i was most uncommonly
shocked indeed </s>
<s> poor edward </s>
<s> he has done for himself
completelyshut himself out for ever from all decent society </s>
<s> but as
i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it </s>
<s> 
from his style of education it was always to be expected </s>
<s>   my poor
mother was half frantic </s>
<s> 

have you ever seen the lady </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in
for ten minutes </s>

<s>   the merest awkward
country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty </s>
<s> 
i remember her perfectly </s>
<s>   just the kind of girl i should suppose
likely to captivate poor edward </s>
<s>   i offered immediately as soon as my
mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade
him from the match </s>
<s>  but it was too late then i found to do any thing
for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it
till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you
know to interfere </s>
<s>   but had i been informed of it a few hours
earlieri think it is most probablethat something might have been
hit on </s>
<s>   i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very
strong light </s>
<s>   my dear fellow i should have said consider what you
are doing </s>
<s>   you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a
one as your family are unanimous in disapproving </s>
<s>  i cannot help
thinking in short that means might have been found </s>
<s>   but now it is
all too late </s>
<s>   he must be starved you know </s>
<s> that is certain </s>
<s> 
absolutely starved </s>
<s> 

he had just settled this point with great composure when the entrance
of <abvr> john dashwood put an end to the subject </s>
<s>   but though she never
spoke of it out of her own family elinor could see its influence on
her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she
entered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself </s>
<s>   she
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that elinor and her
sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of
them </s>
<s> an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the
room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every
thing that was most affectionate and graceful </s>

chapter 


one other short call in harley street in which elinor received her
brothers congratulations on their travelling so far towards barton
without any expense and on colonel brandons being to follow them to
cleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and
sisters in town </s>
<s> and a faint invitation from fanny to come to norland
whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things was
the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public
assurance from john to elinor of the promptitude with which he should
come to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the
country </s>
<s> 

it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send
her to delaford </s>
<s> a place in which of all others she would now least
chuse to visit or wish to reside </s>
<s>  for not only was it considered as
her future home by her brother and <abvr> jennings but even lucy when
they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there </s>
<s> 

very early in april and tolerably early in the day the two parties
from hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respective
homes to meet by appointment on the road </s>
<s>   for the convenience of
charlotte and her child they were to be more than two days on their
journey and <abvr> palmer travelling more expeditiously with colonel
brandon was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival </s>
<s> 

marianne few as had been her hours of comfort in london and eager as
she had long been to quit it could not when it came to the point bid
adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those
hopes and that confidence in willoughby which were now extinguished
for ever without great pain </s>
<s>   nor could she leave the place in which
willoughby remained busy in new engagements and new schemes in which
she could have no share without shedding many tears </s>

elinors satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive </s>

she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on she left
no creature behind from whom it would give her a moments regret to be
divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the
persecution of lucys friendship she was grateful for bringing her
sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage and she looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at barton might
do towards restoring mariannes peace of mind and confirming her own </s>
<s> 

their journey was safely performed </s>
<s>   the second day brought them into
the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was
it dwelt on by turns in mariannes imagination </s>
<s>  and in the forenoon of
the third they drove up to cleveland </s>
<s> 

cleveland was a spacious modernbuilt house situated on a sloping
lawn </s>
<s>   it had no park but the pleasuregrounds were tolerably
extensive </s>
<s>  and like every other place of the same degree of importance
it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smooth
gravel winding round a plantation led to the front the lawn was
dotted over with timber the house itself was under the guardianship of
the fir the mountainash and the acacia and a thick screen of them
altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the
offices </s>
<s> 

marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
consciousness of being only eighty miles from barton and not thirty
from combe magna </s>
<s>  and before she had been five minutes within its
walls while the others were busily helping charlotte to show her child
to the housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through the
winding shrubberies now just beginning to be in beauty to gain a
distant eminence </s>
<s>  where from its grecian temple her eye wandering
over a wide tract of country to the southeast could fondly rest on
the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and fancy that from their
summits combe magna might be seen </s>
<s> 

in such moments of precious invaluable misery she rejoiced in tears
of agony to be at cleveland </s>
<s>  and as she returned by a different circuit
to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of
wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude she
resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained
with the palmers in the indulgence of such solitary rambles </s>
<s> 

she returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house
on an excursion through its more immediate premises </s>
<s>  and the rest of
the morning was easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen
garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the
gardeners lamentations upon blights in dawdling through the
greenhouse where the loss of her favourite plants unwarily exposed
and nipped by the lingering frost raised the laughter of
charlotteand in visiting her poultryyard where in the
disappointed hopes of her dairymaid by hens forsaking their nests or
being stolen by a fox or in the rapid decrease of a promising young
brood she found fresh sources of merriment </s>
<s> 

the morning was fine and dry and marianne in her plan of employment
abroad had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
at cleveland </s>
<s>   with great surprise therefore did she find herself
prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner </s>
<s>   she had
depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple and perhaps all over
the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred
her from it </s>
<s>  but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walking </s>
<s> 

their party was small and the hours passed quietly away </s>
<s>   <abvr> palmer
had her child and <abvr> jennings her carpetwork </s>
<s>  they talked of the
friends they had left behind arranged lady middletons engagements
and wondered whether <abvr> palmer and colonel brandon would get farther
than reading that night </s>
<s>   elinor however little concerned in it
joined in their discourse </s>
<s>  and marianne who had the knack of finding
her way in every house to the library however it might be avoided by
the family in general soon procured herself a book </s>
<s> 

nothing was wanting on <abvr> palmers side that constant and friendly
good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome </s>
<s>   the
openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of
recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms
of politeness </s>
<s>  her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was
engaging </s>
<s>  her folly though evident was not disgusting because it was
not conceited </s>
<s>  and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh </s>
<s> 

the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner affording
a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to
their conversation which a long morning of the same continued rain had
reduced very low </s>
<s> 

elinor had seen so little of <abvr> palmer and in that little had seen so
much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew
not what to expect to find him in his own family </s>
<s>   she found him
however perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother </s>
<s>  she found him
very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from
being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to <abvr>
jennings and charlotte </s>
<s>   for the rest of his character and habits they
were marked as far as elinor could perceive with no traits at all
unusual in his sex and time of life </s>
<s>   he was nice in his eating
uncertain in his hours </s>
<s>  fond of his child though affecting to slight
it </s>
<s>  and idled away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been
devoted to business </s>
<s>   she liked him however upon the whole much
better than she had expected and in her heart was not sorry that she
could like him no more </s>
<s> not sorry to be driven by the observation of
his epicurism his selfishness and his conceit to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of edwards generous temper simple
taste and diffident feelings </s>

intelligence from colonel brandon who had been into dorsetshire
lately </s>

mr </s>

great deal of the parsonage at delaford described its deficiencies
and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them </s>
<s> his
behaviour to her in this as well as in every other particular his
open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days his
readiness to converse with her and his deference for her opinion
might very well justify <abvr> jenningss persuasion of his attachment

first believed marianne his real favourite to make her suspect it
herself </s>
<s>   but as it was such a notion had scarcely ever entered her
head except by <abvr> jenningss suggestion </s>

believing herself the nicest observer of the two </s>

eyes while <abvr> jennings thought only of his behaviour </s>
<s> and while his
looks of anxious solicitude on mariannes feeling in her head and
throat the beginning of a heavy cold because unexpressed by words

them the quick feelings and needless alarm of a lover </s>

over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them

trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest

shoes and stockingsgiven marianne a cold so violent as though for a
day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself </s>

prescriptions poured in from all quarters and as usual were all
declined </s>

cough and a sore throat a good nights rest was to cure her entirely </s>

to bed to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies </s>

felt no real alarm </s>

a very restless and feverish night however disappointed the
expectation of both </s>

for the palmers apothecary </s>

he came examined his patient and though encouraging miss dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health yet by
pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency and allowing the
word infection to pass his lips gave instant alarm to <abvr> palmer
on her babys account </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings who had been inclined from the
first to think mariannes complaint more serious than elinor now
looked very grave on <abvr> harriss report and confirming charlottes
fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with
her infant </s>
<s>  and <abvr> palmer though treating their apprehensions as
idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be
withstood </s>
<s>   her departure therefore was fixed on </s>
<s>  and within an hour
after <abvr> harriss arrival she set off with her little boy and his
nurse for the house of a near relation of <abvr> palmers who lived a
few miles on the other side of bath </s>
<s>  whither her husband promised at
her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two </s>
<s>  and whither she was
almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
however with a kindness of heart which made elinor really love her
declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as
marianne remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care
to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from </s>
<s>  and
elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate
desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better
experience in nursing of material use </s>
<s> 

poor marianne languid and low from the nature of her malady and
feeling herself universally ill could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her recovered </s>
<s>  and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced but for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe </s>
<s>  for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home </s>
<s>  and attended
the whole way by a servant of <abvr> jennings were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon </s>
<s>   the little she said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay </s>
<s>  though elinor tried to
raise her spirits and make her believe as she then really believed
herself that it would be a very short one </s>
<s> 

the next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
patient </s>
<s>  she certainly was not better and except that there was no
amendment did not appear worse </s>
<s>   their party was now farther reduced </s>
<s> 
for <abvr> palmer though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and goodnature as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his wife was persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform his
promise of following her </s>
<s>  and while he was preparing to go colonel
brandon himself with a much greater exertion began to talk of going
likewise </s>
<s> here however the kindness of <abvr> jennings interposed most
acceptably </s>
<s>  for to send the colonel away while his love was in so much
uneasiness on her sisters account would be to deprive them both she
thought of every comfort </s>
<s>  and therefore telling him at once that his
stay at cleveland was necessary to herself that she should want him to
play at piquet of an evening while miss dashwood was above with her
sister &c </s>
<s>  she urged him so strongly to remain that he who was
gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not
long even affect to demur </s>
<s>  especially as <abvr> jenningss entreaty was
warmly seconded by <abvr> palmer who seemed to feel a relief to himself
in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise miss
dashwood in any emergence </s>
<s> 

marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements </s>
<s> 
she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of
cleveland away in about seven days from the time of their arrival </s>
<s>   it
gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of <abvr> palmer </s>
<s>  and as it
gave her likewise no concern she never mentioned her name </s>
<s> 

two days passed away from the time of <abvr> palmers departure and her
situation continued with little variation the same </s>
<s>   <abvr> harris who
attended her every day still talked boldly of a speedy recovery and
miss dashwood was equally sanguine </s>
<s>  but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings had determined very early
in the seizure that marianne would never get over it and colonel
brandon who was chiefly of use in listening to <abvr> jenningss
forebodings was not in a state of mind to resist their influence </s>
<s>   he
tried to reason himself out of fears which the different judgment of
the apothecary seemed to render absurd </s>
<s>  but the many hours of each day
in which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for the
admission of every melancholy idea and he could not expel from his
mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more </s>
<s> 

on the morning of the third day however the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away </s>
<s>  for when <abvr> harris arrived he declared
his patient materially better </s>
<s>   her pulse was much stronger and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit </s>
<s>   elinor confirmed
in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness </s>
<s>  rejoicing that in her
letters to her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her
friends in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at cleveland </s>
<s>  and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be able
to travel </s>
<s> 

but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began </s>
<s>  towards the
evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless and
uncomfortable than before </s>
<s>   her sister however still sanguine was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her bed made </s>
<s>  and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed saw her with satisfaction sink at last into a
slumber from which she expected the most beneficial effects </s>
<s>   her
sleep though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it lasted a
considerable time </s>
<s>  and anxious to observe the result of it herself she
resolved to sit with her during the whole of it </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings
knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to
bed </s>
<s>  her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating
herself in the housekeepers room and elinor remained alone with
marianne </s>
<s> 

the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed </s>
<s>  and her
sister who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of
posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
which passed her lips was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful
a slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out

is mama coming </s>
<s> 

not yet cried the other concealing her terror and assisting
marianne to lie down again but she will be here i hope before it is
long </s>
<s>   it is a great way you know from hence to barton </s>
<s> 

but she must not go round by london cried marianne in the same
hurried manner </s>
<s>   i shall never see her if she goes by london </s>
<s> 

elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself and while
attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse </s>
<s>   it was lower and
quicker than ever </s>
<s>   and marianne still talking wildly of mama her
alarm increased so rapidly as to determine her on sending instantly
for <abvr> harris and despatching a messenger to barton for her mother </s>
<s> 
to consult with colonel brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance </s>
<s>  and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by
her sister she hastened down to the drawingroom where she knew he
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present </s>
<s> 

it was no time for hesitation </s>
<s>   her fears and her difficulties were
immediately before him </s>
<s>   her fears he had no courage no confidence to
attempt the removal of </s>
<s> he listened to them in silent despondence </s>
<s> but
her difficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion and the service prearranged in his mind

<s> 
elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome </s>
<s>  she thanked him
with brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry off his
servant with a message to <abvr> harris and an order for posthorses

collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch and calculated with exactness the time in which she might
look for his return </s>
<s>   not a moment was lost in delay of any kind </s>
<s>   the
horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel brandon
only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken
too low to reach her ear hurried into the carriage </s>
<s>   it was then about
twelve oclock and she returned to her sisters apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her the rest of the
night </s>
<s>   it was a night of almost equal suffering to both </s>

security </s>

mrs </s>

her mistress had always thought </s>
<s> 

mariannes ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her
mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the
heart of poor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness and wretched for some immediate relief
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every thing had
been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational </s>

not come for some other advice when the formerbut not till after
five oclockarrived </s>
<s>   his opinion however made some little amends
for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to
be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure with a confidence which in a lesser degree was
communicated to elinor </s>
<s>   he promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours and left both the patient and her anxious
attendant more composed than he had found them </s>
<s> 

with strong concern and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid did <abvr> jennings hear in the morning of what had passed </s>
<s> 
her former apprehensions now with greater reason restored left her no
doubt of the event </s>
<s>  and though trying to speak comfort to elinor her
conviction of her sisters danger would not allow her to offer the
comfort of hope </s>
<s>   her heart was really grieved </s>
<s>   the rapid decay the
early death of a girl so young so lovely as marianne must have struck
a less interested person with concern </s>
<s>   on <abvr> jenningss compassion
she had other claims </s>
<s>   she had been for three months her companion was
still under her care and she was known to have been greatly injured
and long unhappy </s>
<s>   the distress of her sister too particularly a
favourite was before her </s>
<s> and as for their mother when <abvr> jennings
considered that marianne might probably be to her what charlotte was to

disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce </s>

quietnot more herselfremained in a heavy stupor </s>
<s>   elinor catching

further advice </s>

more to try some more fresh application of whose success he was as

was almost hopeless </s>
<s>  and in this state she continued till noon
scarcely stirring from her sisters bed her thoughts wandering from
one image of grief one suffering friend to another and her spirits

scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
many weeks of previous indisposition which mariannes disappointment
had brought on </s>

again </s>

indulging a thought of its continuance </s>
<s> and elinor conning over every
injunction of distrust told herself likewise not to hope </s>

half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her </s>

others even arose to confirm it </s>

flattered elinor with signs of amendment </s>

on her with a rational though languid gaze </s>
<s>   anxiety and hope now
oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of <abvr> harris at four oclock </s>
<s> when his assurances
his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his
expectation gave her confidence comfort and tears of joy </s>
<s> 

marianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her
entirely out of danger </s>

partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted

gratitude </s>

look and every breath </s>
<s>   the possibility of a relapse would of course
in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety wasbut when she
saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of
recovery continued and saw marianne at six oclock sink into a quiet

doubt </s>

yet kept them in ignorance </s>
<s> 

at seven oclock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined
mrs </s>

kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating
much </s>
<s> and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of
content as she brought to it was particularly welcome </s>

would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before

elinor had no sense of fatigue no capability of sleep at that moment
about her and she was not to be kept away from her sister an
unnecessary instant </s>

the clock struck eight </s>

convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the
house </s>

almost impossibility of their being already come that she moved into
the adjoining dressingcloset and opened a window shutter to be
satisfied of the truth </s>

deceived her </s>

view </s>

chapter 


elinor starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him obeyed
the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room
and her hand was already on the lock when its action was suspended by
his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather of command than
supplication

<s>   but she had

engaged </s>
<s>   after a moments recollection therefore concluding that

elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever </s>

think that he must be in liquor </s>

impression she immediately rose saying

her think him sincere </s>

and on more reasonable grounds </s>

<s> 

elinor bowed her assent </s>
<s> 

i do not know said he after a pause of expectation on her side and
thoughtfulness on his ownhow you may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me </s>
<s>  perhaps you will hardly think the better of meit is

please me </s>
<s>  and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a

was that my heart should have been so insensible </s>

confess my vanity only was elevated by it </s>
<s>   careless of her happiness
thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had
always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every
means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design

miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him with the most

vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i

it </s>

<s>  and whose mindoh </s>

infinitely superior </s>
<s> 

your indifference however towards that unfortunate girli must say
it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
beyour indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her </s>

not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of
understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours </s>

she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be

ignorance of the worldevery thing was against me </s>

i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it </s>

<s> 
the night following this affairi was to go the next morningwas
spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be </s>
<s>   the
struggle was greatbut it ended too soon </s>
<s>   my affection for marianne
my thorough conviction of her attachment to meit was all insufficient
to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false

myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i
persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained
for me to do </s>
<s>   a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave
devonshire </s>
<s> i was engaged to dine with you on that very day </s>
<s>  some
apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement </s>

whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a
point of long debate </s>
<s>   to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and
i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my
resolution </s>
<s>   in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity

report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in

evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous

<s> i was too much
shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the

morning i was in my carriage </s>

<s> 

elinor made no answer </s>
<s>   her thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent

<s>   the world had made him extravagant and

vanity while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another

its offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed </s>
<s>   each faulty
propensity in leading him to evil had led him likewise to punishment </s>
<s> 
the attachment from which against honour against feeling against
every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no

sake of which he had with little scruple left her sister to misery
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature </s>
<s>   from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the
end of some minutes by willoughby who rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful started up in preparation for going and
said

chapter 


elinor for some time after he left her for some time even after the
sound of his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas widely differing in themselves but of which sadness
was the general result to think even of her sister </s>
<s> 

willoughby he whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most
worthless of men willoughby in spite of all his faults excited a
degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them which made
her think of him as now separated for ever from her family with a
tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she soon acknowledged
within herselfto his wishes than to his merits </s>
<s>   she felt that his
influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
in reason to have weight </s>
<s>  by that person of uncommon attraction that
open affectionate and lively manner which it was no merit to possess </s>
<s> 
and by that still ardent love for marianne which it was not even
innocent to indulge </s>
<s>   but she felt that it was so long long before
she could feel his influence less </s>
<s> 

when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne she found her
just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her hopes </s>
<s>   elinors heart was full </s>
<s>   the past the present the
future willoughbys visit mariannes safety and her mothers
expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue and made her only fearful
of betraying herself to her sister </s>
<s>   short was the time however in
which that fear could affect her for within half an hour after
willoughbys leaving the house she was again called down stairs by the
sound of another carriage </s>
<s> eager to save her mother from every
unnecessary moments horrible suspense she ran immediately into the
hall and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
her as she entered it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of mariannes being no more had no voice to
inquire after her no voice even for elinor </s>
<s>  but she waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief </s>
<s> and her
mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much
overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears </s>
<s>   she
was supported into the drawingroom between her daughter and her
friend </s>
<s> and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to
speak embraced elinor again and again turning from her at intervals
to press colonel brandons hand with a look which spoke at once her
gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
of the moment </s>
<s>   he shared it however in a silence even greater than
her own </s>
<s> 

as soon as <abvr> dashwood had recovered herself to see marianne was her
first desire </s>
<s>  and in two minutes she was with her beloved child
rendered dearer to her than ever by absence unhappiness and danger </s>
<s> 
elinors delight as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther
sleep </s>
<s> but <abvr> dashwood could be calm could be even prudent when
the life of a child was at stake and marianne satisfied in knowing
her mother was near her and conscious of being too weak for
conversation submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood would sit up with her all night </s>
<s> 
and elinor in compliance with her mothers entreaty went to bed </s>
<s>   but
the rest which one night entirely sleepless and many hours of the
most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite was kept off by
irritation of spirits </s>
<s>   willoughby poor willoughby as she now
allowed herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts </s>
<s>  she would
not but have heard his vindication for the world and now blamed now
acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before </s>
<s>   but her
promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful </s>
<s>   she
dreaded the performance of it dreaded what its effect on marianne
might be </s>
<s>  doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be
happy with another </s>
<s>  and for a moment wished willoughby a widower </s>
<s> 
then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself felt that to his
sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rivals the reward
of her sister was due and wished any thing rather than <abvr>
willoughbys death </s>
<s> 

the shock of colonel brandons errand at barton had been much softened
to <abvr> dashwood by her own previous alarm </s>
<s>  for so great was her
uneasiness about marianne that she had already determined to set out
for cleveland on that very day without waiting for any further
intelligence and had so far settled her journey before his arrival
that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch margaret away
as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection </s>
<s> 

marianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant cheerfulness of
mrs </s>
<s>  dashwoods looks and spirits proved her to be as she repeatedly
declared herself one of the happiest women in the world </s>
<s>   elinor could
not hear the declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward </s>
<s>   but <abvr>
dashwood trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment
which elinor had sent her was led away by the exuberance of her joy to
think only of what would increase it </s>
<s>   marianne was restored to her
from a danger in which as she now began to feel her own mistaken
judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to willoughby had
contributed to place her </s>
<s> and in her recovery she had yet another
source of joy unthought of by elinor </s>
<s>   it was thus imparted to her as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred </s>
<s> 

at last we are alone </s>
<s>   my elinor you do not yet know all my
happiness </s>
<s>   colonel brandon loves marianne </s>
<s>   he has told me so himself </s>
<s> 

her daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained surprised and
not surprised was all silent attention </s>
<s> 

you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your
composure now </s>
<s>   had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family i should have fixed on colonel brandons marrying one of you as
the object most desirable </s>
<s>   and i believe marianne will be the most
happy with him of the two </s>
<s> 

elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age
characters or feelings could be given </s>
<s> but her mother must always be
carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject and
therefore instead of an inquiry she passed it off with a smile </s>
<s>

out quite unawares quite undesignedly </s>

<s>  i saw
that it equalled my own and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship

marianne </s>
<s>   he has loved her my elinor ever since the first moment of
seeing her </s>
<s> 

here however elinor perceivednot the language not the professions
of colonel brandon but the natural embellishments of her mothers
active fancy which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose </s>
<s> 

his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby
ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or
constantwhich ever we are to call ithas subsisted through all the
knowledge of dear mariannes unhappy prepossession for that worthless
young man </s>
<s> and without selfishnesswithout encouraging a hope </s>
<s> could
he have seen her happy with anothersuch a noble mind </s>
<s> such openness
such sincerity </s>

colonel brandons character said elinor as an excellent man is
well established </s>
<s> 

i know it isreplied her mother seriously or after such a warning
i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased
by it </s>
<s>   but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready
friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men </s>
<s> 

his character however answered elinor does not rest on one act of

him equally sanguine </s>

no </s>

chapter 


mariannes illness though weakening in its kind had not been long
enough to make her recovery slow </s>
<s>  and with youth natural strength and
her mothers presence in aid it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her
to remove within four days after the arrival of the latter into <abvr>
palmers dressingroom </s>
<s>   when there at her own particular request for
she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her
mother colonel brandon was invited to visit her </s>
<s> 

his emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered looks and in
receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him was
such as in elinors conjecture must arise from something more than
his affection for marianne or the consciousness of its being known to
others </s>
<s>  and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he looked at her sister the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his mind brought back by that resemblance
between marianne and eliza already acknowledged and now strengthened
by the hollow eye the sickly skin the posture of reclining weakness
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood not less watchful of what passed than her daughter but
with a mind very differently influenced and therefore watching to very
different effect saw nothing in the colonels behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and selfevident sensations while in the actions
and words of marianne she persuaded herself to think that something
more than gratitude already dawned </s>
<s> 

at the end of another day or two marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours <abvr> dashwood urged equally by her own and her
daughters wishes began to talk of removing to barton </s>
<s>   on her
measures depended those of her two friends </s>
<s>  <abvr> jennings could not
quit cleveland during the dashwoods stay </s>
<s>  and colonel brandon was soon
brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as
equally determinate if not equally indispensable </s>
<s>   at his and <abvr>
jenningss united request in return <abvr> dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his carriage on her journey back for the better
accommodation of her sick child </s>
<s>  and the colonel at the joint
invitation of <abvr> dashwood and <abvr> jennings whose active goodnature
made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself
engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the
course of a few weeks </s>
<s> 

the day of separation and departure arrived </s>
<s>  and marianne after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of <abvr> jennings one so earnestly
grateful so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding
colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend was carefully
assisted by him into the carriage of which he seemed anxious that she
should engross at least half </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood and elinor then followed
and the others were left by themselves to talk of the travellers and
feel their own dullness till <abvr> jennings was summoned to her chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young
companions </s>
<s>  and colonel brandon immediately afterwards took his
solitary way to delaford </s>
<s> 

the dashwoods were two days on the road and marianne bore her journey
on both without essential fatigue </s>
<s>   every thing that the most zealous
affection the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable
was the office of each watchful companion and each found their reward
in her bodily ease and her calmness of spirits </s>
<s>   to elinor the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful </s>
<s>   she who had seen
her week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of
heart which she had neither courage to speak of nor fortitude to
conceal now saw with a joy which no other could equally share an
apparent composure of mind which in being the result as she trusted
of serious reflection must eventually lead her to contentment and
cheerfulness </s>
<s> 

as they approached barton indeed and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection
she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their
notice sat earnestly gazing through the window </s>
<s>   but here elinor
could neither wonder nor blame </s>
<s>  and when she saw as she assisted
marianne from the carriage that she had been crying she saw only an
emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise </s>
<s>   in the whole of her
subsequent manner she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
reasonable exertion </s>
<s>  for no sooner had they entered their common
sittingroom than marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could be
connected </s>
<s> she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile </s>
<s>   after dinner she would try her pianoforte </s>
<s> 
she went to it </s>
<s>  but the music on which her eye first rested was an
opera procured for her by willoughby containing some of their
favourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his
handwriting </s>
<s> that would not do </s>
<s> she shook her head put the music
aside and after running over the keys for a minute complained of
feebleness in her fingers and closed the instrument again </s>
<s>  declaring
however with firmness as she did so that she should in future practice
much </s>
<s> 

the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms </s>
<s>   on the
contrary with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest she looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of
margarets return and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society as the
only happiness worth a wish </s>
<s> 

when the weather is settled and i have recovered my strength said
she we will take long walks together every day </s>
<s>   we will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on </s>
<s>  we will
walk to sir johns new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland </s>
<s> 
and we will often go to the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its
foundations as far as we are told they once reached </s>
<s>   i know we shall
be happy </s>
<s>   i know the summer will pass happily away </s>
<s>   i mean never to
be later in rising than six and from that time till dinner i shall
divide every moment between music and reading </s>
<s>   i have formed my plan
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study </s>
<s>   our own
library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any thing beyond
mere amusement </s>
<s>   but there are many works well worth reading at the
park </s>
<s>  and there are others of more modern production which i know i can
borrow of colonel brandon </s>
<s>   by reading only six hours aday i shall
gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction which
i now feel myself to want </s>
<s> 

elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this </s>
<s> 
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous selfcontrol </s>
<s>  her smile however changed to a sigh when she
remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled and feared
she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
marianne and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity </s>
<s>   willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved
to wait till her sisters health were more secure before she appointed
it </s>
<s>   but the resolution was made only to be broken </s>
<s> 

marianne had been two or three days at home before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out </s>
<s>   but at last a
soft genial morning appeared </s>
<s>  such as might tempt the daughters
wishes and the mothers confidence </s>
<s>  and marianne leaning on elinors
arm was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue in
the lane before the house </s>
<s> 

the sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness of marianne in an
exercise hitherto untried since her illness required </s>
<s> and they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned
towards it marianne calmly said

there exactly therepointing with one hand on that projecting
moundthere i fell </s>
<s>  and there i first saw willoughby </s>
<s> 

her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added

i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the
spot </s>
<s> shall we ever talk on that subject elinor </s>
<s> hesitatingly it
was said </s>
<s> or will it be wrong </s>
<s> i can talk of it now i hope as i
ought to do </s>

elinor tenderly invited her to be open </s>

concerned </s>
<s>   i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been
for him but what they are now </s>
<s> at present if i could be satisfied on
one point if i could be allowed to think that he was not always acting
a part not always deceiving me </s>
<s> but above all if i could be assured
that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied
him since the story of that unfortunate girl

she stopt </s>
<s>   elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered

if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  my peace of mind is doubly involved in it </s>
<s> for not only is it
horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of
such designsbut what must it make me appear to myself </s>

situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to

very very fickle </s>
<s> 

elinor said no more </s>
<s>   she was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her story directly or postponing it till
marianne were in stronger health </s>
<s> and they crept on for a few minutes
in silence </s>
<s> 

i am not wishing him too much good said marianne at last with a
sigh when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own </s>

no </s>

your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure </s>
<s>   my
illness has made me think it has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection </s>
<s>   long before i was enough recovered to talk i
was perfectly able to reflect </s>
<s>   i considered the past </s>
<s>  i saw in my own
behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
autumn nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself and want of
kindness to others </s>
<s>   i saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave </s>

myself by such negligence of my own health as i had felt even at the
time to be wrong </s>

did not know my danger till the danger was removed </s>

consoled her </s>
<s> i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself </s>
<s>   whenever

indulged </s>

<s>   the kindness the
unceasing kindness of <abvr> jennings i had repaid with ungrateful
contempt </s>
<s>   to the middletons to the palmers the steeles to every
common acquaintance even i had been insolent and unjust </s>

hardened against their merits and a temper irritated by their very
attention </s>
<s> to john to fannyyes even to them little as they
deserve i had given less than their due </s>
<s>   but youyou above all
above my mother had been wronged by me </s>
<s>   i and only i knew your
heart and its sorrows </s>
<s>  yet to what did it influence me </s>
<s> not to any
compassion that could benefit you or myself </s>
<s> your example was before
me </s>

<s> was i more considerate of you and your comfort </s>
<s> 
did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking
any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge

here ceased the rapid flow of her selfreproving spirit </s>

deserved </s>

feelings of the past could not be recalled </s>

could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his

<s>   nothing
could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the
interests of colonel brandon </s>
<s> 

had <abvr> dashwood like her daughter heard willoughbys story from
himselfhad she witnessed his distress and been under the influence
of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion
would have been greater </s>
<s>   but it was neither in elinors power nor in
her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed
explanation as had at first been called forth in herself </s>
<s>   reflection
had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of
willoughbys deserts </s>
<s> she wished therefore to declare only the
simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his
character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray </s>
<s> 

in the evening when they were all three together marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him again </s>
<s> but that it was not without an
effort the restless unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for

slowly continued

it is a great relief to mewhat elinor told me this morningi have

<s> for some moments her voice
was lost </s>
<s>  but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness
than beforei am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change </s>
<s>   i
never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later

marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change </s>
<s> 

you consider the matter said elinor exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it </s>
<s>  and i dare say you perceive as
well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain </s>
<s> 
had you married you must have been always poor </s>
<s>   his expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that
selfdenial is a word hardly understood by him </s>
<s>   his demands and your
inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought
on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having
been entirely unknown and unthought of before </s>
<s>   your sense of honour
and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation
to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible </s>
<s>  and
perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort
you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond thatand how
little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
which had begun before your marriage </s>
<s>  beyond that had you
endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not
to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart
and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such
difficulties </s>
<s> 

mariannes lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish </s>
<s>  in a
tone that implieddo you really think him selfish </s>
<s> 

the whole of his behaviour replied elinor from the beginning to
the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness </s>
<s>   it was
selfishness which first made him sport with your affections </s>
<s>  which
afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of
it and which finally carried him from barton </s>
<s>   his own enjoyment or
his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle </s>
<s> 

it is very true </s>
<s>   my happiness never was his object </s>
<s> 

at present continued elinor he regrets what he has done </s>
<s>   and why
does he regret it </s>
<s> because he finds it has not answered towards
himself </s>
<s>   it has not made him happy </s>
<s>   his circumstances are now
unembarrassedhe suffers from no evil of that kind </s>
<s>  and he thinks only
that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself </s>
<s> 
but does it follow that had he married you he would have been
happy </s>
<s> the inconveniences would have been different </s>
<s>   he would then
have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are
removed he now reckons as nothing </s>
<s>   he would have had a wife of whose
temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always
necessitousalways poor </s>
<s>  and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a
wife </s>
<s> 

i have not a doubt of it said marianne </s>

regretnothing but my own folly </s>

rather say your mothers imprudence my child said <abvr> dashwood </s>

marianne would not let her proceed </s>
<s> and elinor satisfied that each
felt their own error wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her sisters spirits </s>
<s>  she therefore pursuing the first
subject immediately continued

one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the
storythat all willoughbys difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams </s>
<s>   that crime
has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present
discontents </s>

marianne assented most feelingly to the remark </s>

by it to an enumeration of colonel brandons injuries and merits warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate </s>

look however as if much of it were heard by her </s>

elinor according to her expectation saw on the two or three following
days that marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done </s>

cheerful and easy her sister could safely trust to the effect of time

i see <abvr> ferrars myself maam this morning in exeter and his lady
too miss steele as was </s>

the new london inn as i went there with a message from sally at the
park to her brother who is one of the postboys </s>
<s>  i happened to look up
as i went by the chaise and so i see directly it was the youngest miss
steele </s>
<s>  so i took off my hat and she knew me and called to me and
inquired after you maam and the young ladies especially miss
marianne and bid me i should give her compliments and <abvr> ferrarss
their best compliments and service and how sorry they was they had not
time to come on and see you but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards for they was going further down for a little while but
howsever when they come back theyd make sure to come and see you </s>
<s> 

but did she tell you she was married thomas </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  she smiled and said how she had changed her name since
she was in these parts </s>
<s>   she was always a very affable and freespoken
young lady and very civil behaved </s>
<s>   so i made free to wish her joy </s>
<s> 

was <abvr> ferrars in the carriage with her </s>
<s> 

yes maam i just see him leaning back in it but he did not look
up </s>
<s> he never was a gentleman much for talking </s>
<s> 

elinors heart could easily account for his not putting himself
forward </s>
<s>  and <abvr> dashwood probably found the same explanation </s>

was there no one else in the carriage </s>

no maam only they two </s>
<s> 

do you know where they came from </s>
<s> 

they come straight from town as miss lucymrs </s>

yes maambut not to bide long </s>

then theyd be sure and call here </s>

<s>  but elinor knew better than
to expect them </s>
<s>   she recognised the whole of lucy in the message and
was very confident that edward would never come near them </s>
<s>   she
observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going
down to <abvr> pratts near plymouth </s>
<s> 

thomass intelligence seemed over </s>
<s>   elinor looked as if she wished to
hear more </s>
<s> 

did you see them off before you came away </s>

no maamthe horses were just coming out but i could not bide any
longer </s>
<s>  i was afraid of being late </s>
<s> 

did <abvr> ferrars look well </s>

yes maam she said how she was very well </s>

always a very handsome young ladyand she seemed vastly contented </s>

<s>  dashwoods and elinors appetites were equally lost and margaret
might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both
her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals she had never been obliged to go
without her dinner before </s>
<s> 

when the dessert and the wine were arranged and <abvr> dashwood and
elinor were left by themselves they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood feared to
hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation </s>
<s>   she now
found that she had erred in relying on elinors representation of
herself </s>
<s>  and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness
suffering as she then had suffered for marianne </s>
<s>   she found that she
had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her
daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well
understood much slighter in reality than she had been wont to
believe or than it was now proved to be </s>
<s>   she feared that under this
persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her
elinor </s>

immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led

chapter 


elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told to consider it

that he should be married soon before as she imagined he could be in

living surprised her a little at first </s>

him should overlook every thing but the risk of delay </s>

they would soon she supposed be settled at delaford </s>
<s> delafordthat
place in which so much conspired to give her an interest </s>
<s>  which she
wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid </s>

elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in london
would write to them to announce the event and give farther
particularsbut day after day passed off and brought no letter no
tidings </s>
<s>   though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault
with every absent friend </s>
<s>   they were all thoughtless or indolent </s>
<s> 

when do you write to colonel brandon maam </s>
<s>  was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on </s>

i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to
hear from him again </s>

not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day </s>

at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other </s>

path </s>

them </s>

his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for
elinor </s>

fearful of his reception and conscious that he merited no kind one </s>

<s>  dashwood however conforming as she trusted to the wishes of

her hand and wished him joy </s>

he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply </s>
<s>   elinors lips
had moved with her mothers and when the moment of action was over
she wished that she had shaken hands with him too </s>
<s>   but it was then too
late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and
talked of the weather </s>
<s> 

marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her
distress </s>
<s>  and margaret understanding some part but not the whole of
the case thought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore
took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a strict
silence </s>
<s> 

when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very
awful pause took place </s>
<s>   it was put an end to by <abvr> dashwood who
felt obliged to hope that he had left <abvr> ferrars very well </s>

elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own

accent of the utmost amazement </s>

<s>   he
rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not
knowing what to do </s>
<s>  took up a pair of scissors that lay there and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice

his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor

agitation as made her hardly know where she was </s>
<s> 

yes said he they were married last week and are now at dawlish </s>
<s> 

elinor could sit it no longer </s>
<s>   she almost ran out of the room and as
soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first
she thought would never cease </s>
<s>   edward who had till then looked any
where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps sawor even
heard her emotion </s>
<s>  for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie
which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of <abvr>
dashwood could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted
the room and walked out towards the villageleaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so
wonderful and so sudden </s>

lessening but by their own conjectures </s>

chapter 


unaccountable however as the circumstances of his release might
appear to the whole family it was certain that edward was free </s>
<s>  and to
what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily predetermined
by all </s>
<s> for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent
engagement contracted without his mothers consent as he had already
done for more than four years nothing less could be expected of him in
the failure of that than the immediate contraction of another </s>
<s> 

his errand at barton in fact was a simple one </s>
<s>   it was only to ask
elinor to marry him </s>
<s> and considering that he was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air </s>
<s> 

how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how
soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred in what manner he
expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly
told </s>
<s>   this only need be said </s>
<s> that when they all sat down to table at
four oclock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his
lady engaged her mothers consent and was not only in the rapturous
profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one
of the happiest of men </s>
<s>   his situation indeed was more than commonly
joyful </s>
<s>   he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
swell his heart and raise his spirits </s>
<s>   he was released without any
reproach to himself from an entanglement which had long formed his
misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love </s>
<s> and elevated at
once to that security with another which he must have thought of
almost with despair as soon as he had learnt to consider it with
desire </s>
<s>   he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to
happiness </s>
<s> and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine
flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in
him before </s>
<s> 

his heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses all its errors
confessed and his first boyish attachment to lucy treated with all the
philosophic dignity of twentyfour </s>
<s> 

it was a foolish idle inclination on my side said he the
consequence of ignorance of the worldand want of employment </s>
<s>   had my
mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen
from the care of <abvr> pratt i thinknay i am sure it would never
have happened </s>
<s>  for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the
time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had
any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied
attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i
must have done </s>
<s>   but instead of having any thing to do instead of
having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any
myself i returned home to be completely idle </s>
<s>  and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which
belonging to the university would have given me </s>
<s>  for i was not entered
at oxford till i was nineteen </s>
<s>   i had therefore nothing in the world to
do but to fancy myself in love </s>
<s>  and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my
brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to
be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and
was always sure of a welcome </s>
<s>  and accordingly i spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen </s>
<s>  lucy appeared everything
that was amiable and obliging </s>
<s>   she was pretty tooat least i thought
so then </s>
<s>  and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no
comparisons and see no defects </s>
<s>   considering everything therefore i
hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every
way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable
piece of folly </s>
<s> 

the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
of the dashwoods was suchso greatas promised them all the
satisfaction of a sleepless night </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood too happy to be
comfortable knew not how to love edward nor praise elinor enough how
to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both </s>
<s> 

marianne could speak her happiness only by tears </s>
<s>   comparisons would
occurregrets would arise </s>
<s> and her joy though sincere as her love
for her sister was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language </s>
<s> 

but elinorhow are her feelings to be described </s>
<s> from the moment of
learning that lucy was married to another that edward was free to the
moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed she
was every thing by turns but tranquil </s>
<s>   but when the second moment had
passed when she found every doubt every solicitude removed compared
her situation with what so lately it had beensaw him honourably
released from his former engagement saw him instantly profiting by the
release to address herself and declare an affection as tender as
constant as she had ever supposed it to beshe was oppressed she was
overcome by her own felicity </s>
<s> and happily disposed as is the human
mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better it
required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any degree
of tranquillity to her heart </s>
<s> 

edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week </s>
<s> for whatever
other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a
week should be given up to the enjoyment of elinors company or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past the present and
the future </s>
<s> for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is
different </s>
<s>   between them no subject is finished no communication is
even made till it has been made at least twenty times over </s>
<s> 

lucys marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers </s>
<s> and
elinors particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in
every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she had ever heard </s>
<s>   how they could be thrown together
and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry a girl of
whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admirationa
girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that
brother had been thrown off by his familyit was beyond her
comprehension to make out </s>
<s>   to her own heart it was a delightful
affair to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but to her
reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle </s>
<s> 

edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing that perhaps
at first accidentally meeting the vanity of the one had been so worked
on by the flattery of the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest </s>
<s> 
elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street of his
opinion of what his own mediation in his brothers affairs might have
done if applied to in time </s>
<s>   she repeated it to edward </s>
<s> 

that was exactly like robertwas his immediate observation </s>
<s> and
that he presently added might perhaps be in his head when the
acquaintance between them first began </s>
<s>   and lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour </s>
<s>   other designs
might afterward arise </s>
<s> 

how long it had been carrying on between them however he was equally
at a loss with herself to make out </s>
<s>  for at oxford where he had
remained for choice ever since his quitting london he had had no means
of hearing of her but from herself and her letters to the very last
were neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual </s>
<s>   not the
smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred to prepare him for
what followed </s>
<s> and when at last it burst on him in a letter from lucy
herself he had been for some time he believed half stupified between
the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance </s>
<s>   he put the
letter into elinors hands </s>
<s> 

     dear sir

     being very sure i have long lost your affections
     i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
     on another and have no doubt of being as happy with
     him as i once used to think i might be with you </s>
<s> 
     but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
     anothers </s>
<s>   sincerely wish you happy in your choice
     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
     good friends as our near relationship now makes
     proper </s>
<s>   i can safely say i owe you no illwill
     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
     ill offices </s>
<s>   your brother has gained my affections
     entirely and as we could not live without one
     another we are just returned from the altar and
     are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which
     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see
     but thought i would first trouble you with these
     few lines and shall always remain

     your sincere wellwisher friend and sister
                                        lucy ferrars </s>
<s> 

     i have burnt all your letters and will return
     your picture the first opportunity </s>
<s>   please to destroy
     my scrawlsbut the ring with my hair you are very
     welcome to keep </s>
<s> 

elinor read and returned it without any comment </s>
<s> 

i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition said
edward </s>
<s> for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you
in former days </s>
<s> in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife </s>
<s> how i
have blushed over the pages of her writing </s>
<s> and i believe i may say
that since the first half year of our foolishbusinessthis is the
only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me
any amends for the defect of the style </s>
<s> 

however it may have come about said elinor after a pausethey
are certainly married </s>
<s>   and your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment </s>
<s>   the independence she settled on robert
through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own
choice </s>
<s>  and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
ayear to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for
intending to do </s>
<s>   she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by roberts
marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her </s>
<s> 

she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite </s>
<s> she
will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him
much sooner </s>
<s> 

in what state the affair stood at present between them edward knew
not for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted
by him </s>
<s>   he had quitted oxford within four and twenty hours after
lucys letter arrived and with only one object before him the nearest
road to barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct with
which that road did not hold the most intimate connection </s>
<s>   he could do
nothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood </s>
<s>  and by his
rapidity in seeking that fate it is to be supposed in spite of the
jealousy with which he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite of
the modesty with which he rated his own deserts and the politeness
with which he talked of his doubts he did not upon the whole expect
a very cruel reception </s>
<s>   it was his business however to say that he
did and he said it very prettily </s>
<s>   what he might say on the subject a
twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination of husbands and
wives </s>
<s> 

that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish of
malice against him in her message by thomas was perfectly clear to
elinor </s>
<s>  and edward himself now thoroughly enlightened on her
character had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton illnature </s>
<s>  though his eyes had been long opened
even before his acquaintance with elinor began to her ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her opinionsthey had been equally
imputed by him to her want of education </s>
<s>  and till her last letter
reached him he had always believed her to be a welldisposed
goodhearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself </s>
<s>   nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an
engagement which long before the discovery of it laid him open to his
mothers anger had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
him </s>
<s> 

i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings to give
her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was
renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in
the world to assist me </s>
<s>   in such a situation as that where there
seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly
insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but
the most disinterested affection was her inducement </s>
<s>   and even now i
cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage
it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the
smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world </s>
<s> 
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour </s>
<s> 
that your own family might in time relent </s>
<s>   and at any rate she lost
nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it
fettered neither her inclination nor her actions </s>
<s>   the connection was
certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration
among her friends </s>
<s>  and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would
be better for her to marry you than be single </s>
<s> 

edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have
been more natural than lucys conduct nor more selfevident than the
motive of it </s>
<s> 

elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at
norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy </s>
<s> 

your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she </s>
<s>  becauseto say
nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to
fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be </s>
<s> 

he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken
confidence in the force of his engagement </s>
<s> 

i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to
another there could be no danger in my being with you </s>
<s>  and that the
consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
as my honour </s>
<s>   i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only
friendship </s>
<s>  and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and
lucy i did not know how far i was got </s>
<s>   after that i suppose i was
wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i
reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than
these </s>
<s> the danger is my own </s>
<s>  i am doing no injury to anybody but
myself </s>
<s> 

elinor smiled and shook her head </s>
<s> 

edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons being expected at the
cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him
but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented
his giving him the living of delafordwhich at present said he
after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion
he must think i have never forgiven him for offering </s>
<s> 

now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place </s>
<s> 
but so little interest had he taken in the matter that he owed all his
knowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the parish
condition of the land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself who
had heard so much of it from colonel brandon and heard it with so much
attention as to be entirely mistress of the subject </s>
<s> 

one question after this only remained undecided between them one
difficulty only was to be overcome </s>
<s>   they were brought together by
mutual affection with the warmest approbation of their real friends </s>
<s> 
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certainand they only wanted something to live upon </s>
<s>   edward had two
thousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was all
that they could call their own </s>
<s>  for it was impossible that <abvr>
dashwood should advance anything </s>
<s>  and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds ayear
would supply them with the comforts of life </s>
<s> 

edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his
mother towards him </s>
<s>  and on that he rested for the residue of their
income </s>
<s>   but elinor had no such dependence </s>
<s>  for since edward would
still be unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself had been
spoken of in <abvr> ferrarss flattering language as only a lesser evil
than his chusing lucy steele she feared that roberts offence would
serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny </s>
<s> 

about four days after edwards arrival colonel brandon appeared to
complete <abvr> dashwoods satisfaction and to give her the dignity of
having for the first time since her living at barton more company
with her than her house would hold </s>
<s>   edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore walked every
night to his old quarters at the park </s>
<s>  from whence he usually returned
in the morning early enough to interrupt the lovers first teteatete
before breakfast </s>
<s> 

a three weeks residence at delaford where in his evening hours at
least he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirtysix and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in mariannes looks all the kindness
of her welcome and all the encouragement of her mothers language to
make it cheerful </s>
<s>   among such friends however and such flattery he
did revive </s>
<s>   no rumour of lucys marriage had yet reached him </s>
<s> he knew
nothing of what had passed </s>
<s>  and the first hours of his visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering </s>
<s>   every thing was
explained to him by <abvr> dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoice
in what he had done for <abvr> ferrars since eventually it promoted the
interest of elinor </s>
<s> 

it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced in the good
opinion of each other as they advanced in each others acquaintance
for it could not be otherwise </s>
<s>   their resemblance in good principles
and good sense in disposition and manner of thinking would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other
attraction </s>
<s>  but their being in love with two sisters and two sisters
fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment </s>
<s> 

the letters from town which a few days before would have made every
nerve in elinors body thrill with transport now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth </s>
<s>   <abvr> jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale to vent her honest indignation against the jilting
girl and pour forth her compassion towards poor <abvr> edward who she
was sure had quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now by all
accounts almost brokenhearted at oxford </s>
<s>  i do think she
continued nothing was ever carried on so sly </s>
<s>  for it was but two days
before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me </s>
<s>   not a soul
suspected anything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul </s>
<s>   came
crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of <abvr> ferrars
as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth </s>
<s>  for lucy it seems
borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on purpose we
suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not seven shillings in
the world </s>
<s> so i was very glad to give her five guineas to take her
down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with
mrs </s>
<s>  burgess in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor
again </s>
<s>   and i must say that lucys crossness not to take them along
with them in the chaise is worse than all </s>
<s>   poor <abvr> edward </s>
<s>  i cannot
get him out of my head but you must send for him to barton and miss
marianne must try to comfort him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dashwoods strains were more solemn </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars was the most
unfortunate of womenpoor fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibilityand he considered the existence of each under such a
blow with grateful wonder </s>
<s>   roberts offence was unpardonable but
lucys was infinitely worse </s>
<s>   neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to <abvr> ferrars </s>
<s>  and even if she might hereafter be induced
to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her
daughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence </s>
<s>   the secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion
of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to
prevent the marriage </s>
<s>  and he called on elinor to join with him in
regretting that lucys engagement with edward had not rather been
fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery
farther in the family </s>
<s>  he thus continued </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  ferrars has never yet mentioned edwards name which does not
surprise us </s>
<s>  but to our great astonishment not a line has been
received from him on the occasion </s>
<s>   perhaps however he is kept silent
by his fear of offending and i shall therefore give him a hint by a
line to oxford that his sister and i both think a letter of proper
submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny and by her shewn to
her mother might not be taken amiss </s>
<s>  for we all know the tenderness of
mrs </s>
<s>  ferrarss heart and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be
on good terms with her children </s>
<s> 

this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
edward </s>
<s>   it determined him to attempt a reconciliation though not
exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister </s>
<s> 

a letter of proper submission </s>
<s>  repeated he </s>
<s>  would they have me beg
my mothers pardon for roberts ingratitude to her and breach of
honour to me </s>
<s> i can make no submissioni am grown neither humble nor
penitent by what has passed </s>
<s> i am grown very happy </s>
<s>  but that would not
interest </s>
<s> i know of no submission that is proper for me to make </s>
<s> 

you may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because you have
offended </s>
<s> and i should think you might now venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mothers anger </s>
<s> 

he agreed that he might </s>
<s> 

and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be
convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent
in her eyes as the first </s>
<s> 

he had nothing to urge against it but still resisted the idea of a
letter of proper submission </s>
<s>  and therefore to make it easier to him
as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead of writing
to fanny he should go to london and personally intreat her good
offices in his favour </s>
<s>  and if they really do interest themselves
said marianne in her new character of candour in bringing about a
reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely
without merit </s>
<s> 

after a visit on colonel brandons side of only three or four days the
two gentlemen quitted barton together </s>
<s>  they were to go immediately to
delaford that edward might have some personal knowledge of his future
home and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements
were needed to it </s>

nights he was to proceed on his journey to town </s>

chapter 


after a proper resistance on the part of <abvr> ferrars just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always
seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable edward
was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son </s>
<s> 

her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating </s>
<s>   for many years of
her life she had had two sons </s>
<s>  but the crime and annihilation of edward
a few weeks ago had robbed her of one </s>
<s>  the similar annihilation of
robert had left her for a fortnight without any </s>
<s>  and now by the
resuscitation of edward she had one again </s>
<s> 

in spite of his being allowed once more to live however he did not
feel the continuance of his existence secure till he had revealed his
present engagement </s>
<s>  for the publication of that circumstance he
feared might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry him off
as rapidly as before </s>
<s>   with apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed and he was listened to with unexpected calmness </s>
<s>   <abvr>
ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying
miss dashwood by every argument in her power </s>
<s> told him that in miss
morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune </s>
<s> and
enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was only
the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three </s>
<s>  but when
she found that though perfectly admitting the truth of her
representation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it she
judged it wisest from the experience of the past to submitand
therefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own
dignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of goodwill she
issued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor </s>
<s> 

what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
be considered </s>
<s>  and here it plainly appeared that though edward was now
her only son he was by no means her eldest </s>
<s>  for while robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear not the smallest
objection was made against edwards taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost </s>
<s>  nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future beyond the ten thousand pounds which had
been given with fanny </s>
<s> 

it was as much however as was desired and more than was expected by
edward and elinor </s>
<s>  and <abvr> ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses
seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more </s>
<s> 

with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them
they had nothing to wait for after edward was in possession of the
living but the readiness of the house to which colonel brandon with
an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor was making
considerable improvements </s>
<s>  and after waiting some time for their
completion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor
as usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready and the ceremony took place in barton
church early in the autumn </s>
<s> 

the first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
mansionhouse </s>
<s>  from whence they could superintend the progress of the
parsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spot </s>
<s> could
chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep </s>
<s>   <abvr> jenningss
prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled </s>
<s>  for
she was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage by
michaelmas and she found in elinor and her husband as she really
believed one of the happiest couples in the world </s>
<s>   they had in fact
nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel brandon and marianne
and rather better pasturage for their cows </s>
<s> 

they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
and friends </s>
<s>   <abvr> ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was
almost ashamed of having authorised </s>
<s>  and even the dashwoods were at the
expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour </s>
<s> 

i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister said john as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of delaford
house that would be saying too much for certainly you have been one
of the most fortunate young women in the world as it is </s>
<s>   but i
confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon
brother </s>
<s>   his property here his place his house every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition </s>
<s> and his woods </s>
<s> i have not
seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there is now standing in
delaford hanger </s>
<s> and though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly
the person to attract himyet i think it would altogether be advisable
for you to have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel
brandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what may
happenfor when people are much thrown together and see little of
anybody elseand it will always be in your power to set her off to
advantage and so forth </s>
<s> in short you may as well give her a
chanceyou understand me </s>
<s> 

but though <abvr> ferrars did come to see them and always treated them
with the makebelieve of decent affection they were never insulted by
her real favour and preference </s>
<s>   that was due to the folly of robert
and the cunning of his wife </s>
<s>  and it was earned by them before many
months had passed away </s>
<s>   the selfish sagacity of the latter which had
at first drawn robert into the scrape was the principal instrument of
his deliverance from it </s>
<s>  for her respectful humility assiduous
attentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening was
given for their exercise reconciled <abvr> ferrars to his choice and
reestablished him completely in her favour </s>
<s> 

the whole of lucys behaviour in the affair and the prosperity which
crowned it therefore may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest an unceasing attention to selfinterest however
its progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing every
advantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience </s>
<s>   when robert first sought her acquaintance and privately
visited her in bartletts buildings it was only with the view imputed
to him by his brother </s>
<s>   he merely meant to persuade her to give up the
engagement </s>
<s>  and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter </s>
<s>   in that point however and that only he erred </s>
<s> for
though lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her
in time another visit another conversation was always wanted to
produce this conviction </s>
<s>   some doubts always lingered in her mind when
they parted which could only be removed by another half hours
discourse with himself </s>
<s>   his attendance was by this means secured and
the rest followed in course </s>
<s>   instead of talking of edward they came
gradually to talk only of roberta subject on which he had always
more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an
interest even equal to his own </s>
<s>  and in short it became speedily
evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother </s>
<s>   he was
proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward and very proud of
marrying privately without his mothers consent </s>
<s>   what immediately
followed is known </s>
<s>   they passed some months in great happiness at
dawlish </s>
<s>  for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cutand
he drew several plans for magnificent cottages </s>
<s> and from thence
returning to town procured the forgiveness of <abvr> ferrars by the
simple expedient of asking it which at lucys instigation was
adopted </s>
<s>   the forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonable
comprehended only robert </s>
<s>  and lucy who had owed his mother no duty and
therefore could have transgressed none still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned </s>
<s>   but perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages in selfcondemnation for roberts offence and gratitude for
the unkindness she was treated with procured her in time the haughty
notice which overcame her by its graciousness and led soon afterwards
by rapid degrees to the highest state of affection and influence </s>
<s> 
lucy became as necessary to <abvr> ferrars as either robert or fanny </s>
<s> 
and while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
to marry her and elinor though superior to her in fortune and birth
was spoken of as an intruder she was in every thing considered and
always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child </s>
<s>   they settled in
town received very liberal assistance from <abvr> ferrars were on the
best terms imaginable with the dashwoods </s>
<s>  and setting aside the
jealousies and illwill continually subsisting between fanny and lucy
in which their husbands of course took a part as well as the frequent
domestic disagreements between robert and lucy themselves nothing
could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together </s>
<s> 

what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son might have
puzzled many people to find out </s>
<s>  and what robert had done to succeed to
it might have puzzled them still more </s>
<s>   it was an arrangement
however justified in its effects if not in its cause </s>
<s>  for nothing
ever appeared in roberts style of living or of talking to give a
suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income as either leaving
his brother too little or bringing himself too much </s>
<s> and if edward
might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every
particular from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home and
from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits he might be supposed no
less contented with his lot no less free from every wish of an
exchange </s>
<s> 

elinors marriage divided her as little from her family as could well
be contrived without rendering the cottage at barton entirely useless
for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her </s>
<s>   <abvr> dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her visits at delaford </s>
<s>  for her wish of bringing
marianne and colonel brandon together was hardly less earnest though
rather more liberal than what john had expressed </s>
<s>   it was now her
darling object </s>
<s>   precious as was the company of her daughter to her
she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her
valued friend </s>
<s>  and to see marianne settled at the mansionhouse was
equally the wish of edward and elinor </s>
<s>   they each felt his sorrows and
their own obligations and marianne by general consent was to be the
reward of all </s>
<s> 

with such a confederacy against herwith a knowledge so intimate of
his goodnesswith a conviction of his fond attachment to herself
which at last though long after it was observable to everybody
elseburst on herwhat could she do </s>
<s> 

marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate </s>
<s>   she was born to
discover the falsehood of her own opinions and to counteract by her
conduct her most favourite maxims </s>
<s>   she was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship voluntarily to give
her hand to another </s>
<s> and that other a man who had suffered no less
than herself under the event of a former attachment whom two years
before she had considered too old to be marriedand who still sought
the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat </s>
<s> 

but so it was </s>
<s>   instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion as once she had fondly flattered herself with expectinginstead
of remaining even for ever with her mother and finding her only
pleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her more calm and
sober judgment she had determined onshe found herself at nineteen
submitting to new attachments entering on new duties placed in a new
home a wife the mistress of a family and the patroness of a village </s>
<s> 

colonel brandon was now as happy as all those who best loved him
believed he deserved to be </s>
<s> in marianne he was consoled for every past
affliction </s>
<s> her regard and her society restored his mind to animation
and his spirits to cheerfulness </s>
<s>  and that marianne found her own
happiness in forming his was equally the persuasion and delight of
each observing friend </s>
<s>   marianne could never love by halves </s>
<s>  and her
whole heart became in time as much devoted to her husband as it had
once been to willoughby </s>
<s> 

willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang </s>
<s>  and his
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
mrs </s>
<s>  smith who by stating his marriage with a woman of character as
the source of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he
behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have been happy
and rich </s>
<s>   that his repentance of misconduct which thus brought its
own punishment was sincere need not be doubted </s>
<s> nor that he long
thought of colonel brandon with envy and of marianne with regret </s>
<s>   but
that he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society or
contracted an habitual gloom of temper or died of a broken heart must
not be depended onfor he did neither </s>
<s>   he lived to exert and
frequently to enjoy himself </s>
<s>   his wife was not always out of humour
nor his home always uncomfortable </s>
<s>  and in his breed of horses and dogs
and in sporting of every kind he found no inconsiderable degree of
domestic felicity </s>
<s> 

for marianne howeverin spite of his incivility in surviving her
losshe always retained that decided regard which interested him in
every thing that befell her and made her his secret standard of
perfection in woman </s>
<s> and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him
in afterdays as bearing no comparison with <abvr> brandon </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage without
attempting a removal to delaford </s>
<s>  and fortunately for sir john and <abvr>
jennings when marianne was taken from them margaret had reached an
age highly suitable for dancing and not very ineligible for being
supposed to have a lover </s>
<s> 

between barton and delaford there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate </s>
<s> and among the
merits and the happiness of elinor and marianne let it not be ranked
as the least considerable that though sisters and living almost
within sight of each other they could live without disagreement
between themselves or producing coolness between their husbands </s>
<s> 
<s> it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife </s>
<s> 

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters </s>
<s> 

my dear <abvr> bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last </s>

mr </s>

you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it </s>

why my dear you must know <abvr> long says that netherfield is taken

down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with <abvr> morris immediately </s>

what is his name </s>

bingley </s>

is he married or single </s>

<s>  a single man of large fortune </s>
<s>  four or
five thousand a year </s>
<s>  what a fine thing for our girls </s>

how so </s>

my dear <abvr> bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome </s>
<s>  you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them </s>
<s> 

is that his design in settling here </s>
<s> 

design </s>
<s>  nonsense how can you talk so </s>
<s>  but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes </s>
<s> 

i see no occasion for that </s>
<s>  you and the girls may go or you may send
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are
as handsome as any of them <abvr> bingley may like you the best of the

<s> 

my dear you flatter me </s>
<s>  i certainly have had my share of beauty but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now </s>
<s>  when a woman has five
grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty </s>

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of </s>
<s> 

but my dear you must indeed go and see <abvr> bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood </s>
<s> 

it is more than i engage for i assure you </s>
<s> 

but consider your daughters </s>
<s>  only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them </s>
<s>  sir william and lady lucas are determined to

<s>  indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to
visit him if you do not </s>
<s> 

you are overscrupulous surely </s>
<s>  i dare say <abvr> bingley will be very
glad to see you </s>
<s>  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls </s>
<s>  though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy </s>

i desire you will do no such thing </s>
<s>  lizzy is not a bit better than the
others </s>

they have none of them much to recommend them replied he </s>
<s>  they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls </s>

quickness than her sisters </s>

mr </s>
<s>  bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way </s>
<s>  you
take delight in vexing me </s>
<s>  you have no compassion for my poor nerves </s>

visit them </s>
<s> 

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them
all </s>

mr </s>
<s>  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character </s>

little information and uncertain temper </s>

<s>  the business of her life was to get her
daughters married </s>
<s>  its solace was visiting and news </s>

mr </s>
<s>  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  he
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go </s>
<s>  and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it </s>
<s>  it was then disclosed in the following
manner </s>
<s>  observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
suddenly addressed her with </s>
<s> 

i hope <abvr> bingley will like it lizzy </s>
<s> 

we are not in a way to know what <abvr> bingley likes said her mother
resentfully since we are not to visit </s>
<s> 

but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the
assemblies and that <abvr> long promised to introduce him </s>
<s> 

i do not believe <abvr> long will do any such thing </s>
<s>  she has two nieces

<s>  she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion

mrs </s>

herself began scolding one of her daughters </s>
<s> 

dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake </s>

compassion on my nerves </s>

<s>  when is

<s> 

aye so it is cried her mother and <abvr> long does not come back

then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce
mr </s>

impossible <abvr> bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
myself </s>

the girls stared at their father </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet said only nonsense
nonsense </s>
<s> 

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation </s>
<s>  cried he </s>
<s>  do
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on
them as nonsense </s>
<s>  i cannot quite agree with you there </s>
<s>  what say you
mary </s>
<s>  for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read
great books and make extracts </s>

mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how </s>
<s> 

while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to <abvr>
bingley </s>

i am sick of <abvr> bingley cried his wife </s>

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished </s>

bennet perhaps surpassing the rest </s>
<s>  though when the first tumult of joy
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while </s>

how good it was in you my dear <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  but i knew i should
persuade you at last </s>
<s>  i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance </s>
<s>  well how pleased i am </s>
<s>  and it is such a
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now </s>

now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said <abvr> bennet </s>

what an excellent father you have girls </s>
<s>  said she when the door was
shut </s>
<s>  i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness </s>
<s> 
or me either for that matter </s>
<s>  at our time of life it is not so
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day </s>
<s>  but
for your sakes we would do anything </s>
<s>  lydia my love though you are
the youngest i dare say <abvr> bingley will dance with you at the next
ball </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said lydia stoutly i am not afraid </s>
<s>  for though i am the
youngest im the tallest </s>
<s> 

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return <abvr> bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to
dinner </s>
<s> 

not all that <abvr> bennet however with the assistance of her five
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  they attacked him
in various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and
distant surmises </s>
<s>  but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at
last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas </s>
<s>  her report was highly favourable </s>
<s>  sir william had been
delighted with him </s>
<s>  he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party </s>
<s>  nothing could be more delightful </s>
<s>  to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love </s>
<s>  and very lively
hopes of <abvr> bingleys heart were entertained </s>
<s> 

if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield
 said <abvr> bennet to her husband and all the others equally well
married i shall have nothing to wish for </s>
<s> 

in a few days <abvr> bingley returned <abvr> bennets visit and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library </s>
<s>  he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had
heard much </s>
<s>  but he saw only the father </s>
<s>  the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse </s>
<s> 

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched </s>
<s>  and already
had <abvr> bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable
to accept the honour of their invitation etc </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was quite
disconcerted </s>
<s>  she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be </s>
<s>  lady lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get
a large party for the ball </s>
<s>  and a report soon followed that <abvr> bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly </s>
<s> 
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin </s>
<s>  and when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogethermr </s>
<s>  bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and
another young man </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike </s>
<s>  he had a pleasant
countenance and easy unaffected manners </s>
<s>  his sisters were fine women
with an air of decided fashion </s>
<s>  his brotherinlaw <abvr> hurst merely
looked the gentleman </s>
<s>  but his friend <abvr> darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year </s>
<s>  the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than <abvr> bingley and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity </s>
<s>  for he was discovered to be
proud </s>
<s>  to be above his company and above being pleased </s>
<s>  and not all
his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room </s>
<s>  he was lively and unreserved danced every dance
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving
one himself at netherfield </s>
<s>  such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves </s>
<s>  what a contrast between him and his friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy danced
only once with <abvr> hurst and once with miss bingley declined being
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party </s>
<s> 
his character was decided </s>
<s>  he was the proudest most disagreeable man
in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again </s>
<s> 
amongst the most violent against him was <abvr> bennet whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters </s>
<s> 

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit
down for two dances </s>
<s>  and during part of that time <abvr> darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and <abvr>
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend
to join it </s>
<s> 

come darcy said he i must have you dance </s>
<s>  i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner </s>
<s>  you had much better
dance </s>
<s> 

i certainly shall not </s>
<s>  you know how i detest it unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner </s>
<s>  at such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable </s>
<s>  your sisters are engaged and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with </s>
<s> 

i would not be so fastidious as you are cried <abvr> bingley for a
kingdom </s>
<s>  upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as i have this evening </s>
<s>  and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty </s>
<s> 

you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said <abvr>
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld </s>
<s>  but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i
dare say very agreeable </s>
<s>  do let me ask my partner to introduce you </s>
<s> 

which do you mean </s>
<s>  and turning round he looked for a moment at
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said </s>
<s> 
she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me </s>
<s>  i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men </s>
<s>  you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles for you are wasting your time with me </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley followed his advice </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy walked off </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him </s>
<s>  she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends </s>
<s>  for she had a lively
playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous </s>
<s> 

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley had danced with her twice and she had been
distinguished by his sisters </s>
<s>  jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be though in a quieter way </s>
<s>  elizabeth felt janes
pleasure </s>
<s>  mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball </s>
<s>  they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they
were the principal inhabitants </s>
<s>  they found <abvr> bennet still up </s>
<s>  with
a book he was regardless of time </s>
<s>  and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations </s>
<s>  he had rather hoped that his wifes views on
the stranger would be disappointed </s>
<s>  but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> bennet as she entered the room we have had a most
delightful evening a most excellent ball </s>
<s>  i wish you had been there </s>
<s> 
jane was so admired nothing could be like it </s>
<s>  everybody said how well
she looked </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with
her twice </s>
<s>  only think of that my dear </s>
<s>  he actually danced with her
twice </s>
<s>  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time </s>
<s>  first of all he asked miss lucas </s>
<s>  i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her </s>
<s>  but however he did not admire her at all </s>
<s>  indeed nobody
can you know </s>
<s>  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance </s>
<s>  so he inquired who she was and got introduced and
asked her for the two next </s>
<s>  then the two third he danced with miss king
and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again
and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger

if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently
he would not have danced half so much </s>
<s>  for gods sake say no more of
his partners </s>
<s>  oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear i am quite delighted with him </s>
<s>  he is so excessively
handsome </s>
<s>  and his sisters are charming women </s>
<s>  i never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses </s>
<s>  i dare say the lace upon <abvr>
hursts gown

here she was interrupted again </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet protested against any
description of finery </s>
<s>  she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy </s>
<s>  for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at
all worth pleasing </s>
<s>  so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him </s>
<s>  he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very
great </s>
<s>  not handsome enough to dance with </s>
<s>  i wish you had been there my
dear to have given him one of your setdowns </s>
<s>  i quite detest the man </s>
<s> 



chapter 


when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in
her praise of <abvr> bingley before expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him </s>
<s> 

he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible
goodhumoured lively </s>
<s>  and i never saw such happy manners </s>
<s> so much
ease with such perfect good breeding </s>
<s> 

he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can </s>
<s>  his character is thereby complete </s>
<s> 

i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time </s>
<s>  i
did not expect such a compliment </s>
<s> 

did not you </s>
<s>  i did for you </s>
<s>  but that is one great difference between
us </s>
<s>  compliments always take you by surprise and me never </s>
<s>  what
could be more natural than his asking you again </s>
<s>  he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room </s>
<s>  no thanks to his gallantry for that </s>
<s>  well he certainly is
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him </s>
<s>  you have liked many a
stupider person </s>
<s> 

dear lizzy </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general </s>
<s> 
you never see a fault in anybody </s>
<s>  all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes </s>
<s>  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life </s>
<s> 

i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone </s>
<s>  but i always speak
what i think </s>
<s> 

i know you do </s>
<s>  and it is that which makes the wonder </s>
<s>  with your
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others </s>
<s>  affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it
everywhere </s>
<s>  but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the
good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing
of the badbelongs to you alone </s>
<s>  and so you like this mans sisters
too do you </s>
<s>  their manners are not equal to his </s>
<s> 

certainly notat first </s>
<s>  but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them </s>
<s>  miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house </s>
<s>  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced </s>
<s>  their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general </s>
<s>  and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she
was very little disposed to approve them </s>
<s>  they were in fact very fine
ladies </s>
<s>  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and
conceited </s>
<s>  they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of
associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others </s>
<s>  they were of
a respectable family in the north of england </s>
<s>  a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an
estate but did not live to do it </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley intended it likewise and
sometimes made choice of his county </s>
<s>  but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to
purchase </s>
<s> 

his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own </s>
<s>  but
though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was <abvr> hurst who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at netherfield house </s>
<s>  he did look at it and into it for
halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it
immediately </s>
<s> 

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of
great opposition of character </s>
<s>  bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied </s>
<s>  on the strength of darcys regard bingley
had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion </s>
<s> 
in understanding darcy was the superior </s>
<s>  bingley was by no means
deficient but darcy was clever </s>
<s>  he was at the same time haughty
reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not
inviting </s>
<s>  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage </s>
<s>  bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually
giving offense </s>
<s> 

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic </s>
<s>  bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life </s>
<s>  everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him </s>
<s>  there had been no formality no stiffness </s>
<s>  he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room </s>
<s>  and as to miss bennet he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful </s>
<s>  darcy on the contrary had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received
either attention or pleasure </s>
<s>  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty
but she smiled too much </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired
her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one
whom they would not object to know more of </s>
<s>  miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose </s>
<s> 



chapter 


within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate </s>
<s>  sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty </s>
<s> 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly </s>
<s>  it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town </s>
<s> 
and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and
unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world </s>
<s>  for though elated by his rank it did not render him
supercilious </s>
<s>  on the contrary he was all attention to everybody </s>
<s>  by
nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st </s>
<s> 
jamess had made him courteous </s>
<s> 

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  they had several children </s>
<s>  the eldest
of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was
elizabeths intimate friend </s>
<s> 

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary </s>
<s>  and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate </s>
<s> 

you began the evening well charlotte said <abvr> bennet with civil
selfcommand to miss lucas </s>
<s>  you were <abvr> bingleys first choice </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but he seemed to like his second better </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice </s>
<s>  to be
sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he
didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething
about <abvr> robinson </s>
<s> 

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and <abvr> robinson </s>
<s>  did not
i mention it to you </s>
<s>  <abvr> robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest </s>
<s>  and his
answering immediately to the last question </s>
<s>  �oh </s>
<s>  the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt </s>
<s>  there cannot be two opinions on that point </s>
<s> 

upon my word </s>
<s>  well that is very decided indeedthat does seem as
ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know </s>
<s> 

my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said
charlotte </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend
is he </s>
<s> poor eliza </s>
<s> to be only just tolerable </s>
<s> 

i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him </s>
<s>  <abvr> long told me last night that he
sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips </s>
<s> 

are you quite sure maam </s>
<s> is not there a little mistake </s>
<s>  said jane </s>
<s> 
i certainly saw <abvr> darcy speaking to her </s>
<s> 

ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he
could not help answering her </s>
<s>  but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to </s>
<s> 

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much
unless among his intimate acquaintances </s>
<s>  with them he is remarkably
agreeable </s>
<s> 

i do not believe a word of it my dear </s>
<s>  if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to <abvr> long </s>
<s>  but i can guess how it
was </s>
<s>  everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had
heard somehow that <abvr> long does not keep a carriage and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise </s>
<s> 

i do not mind his not talking to <abvr> long said miss lucas but i
wish he had danced with eliza </s>
<s> 

another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him
if i were you </s>
<s> 

i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him </s>
<s> 

his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride
often does because there is an excuse for it </s>
<s>  one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour
should think highly of himself </s>
<s>  if i may so express it he has a right
to be proud </s>
<s> 

that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive
his pride if he had not mortified mine </s>
<s> 

pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections is a very common failing i believe </s>
<s>  by all that i have
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed </s>
<s>  that human
nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some
quality or other real or imaginary </s>
<s>  vanity and pride are different
things though the words are often used synonymously </s>
<s>  a person may
be proud without being vain </s>
<s>  pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us </s>
<s> 

if i were as rich as <abvr> darcy cried a young lucas who came with
his sisters i should not care how proud i was </s>
<s>  i would keep a pack of
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day </s>
<s> 

then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said <abvr>
bennet </s>
<s>  and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly </s>
<s> 

the boy protested that she should not </s>
<s>  she continued to declare that she
would and the argument ended only with the visit </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield </s>
<s>  the visit
was soon returned in due form </s>
<s>  miss bennets pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of <abvr> hurst and miss bingley </s>
<s>  and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to
a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards
the two eldest </s>
<s>  by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them </s>
<s> 
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration </s>
<s>  it
was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and
to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a
way to be very much in love </s>
<s>  but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent </s>
<s>  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas </s>
<s> 

it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose
on the public in such a case </s>
<s>  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded </s>
<s>  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him </s>
<s>  and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark </s>
<s>  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself </s>
<s>  we can all
begin freelya slight preference is natural enough </s>
<s>  but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement </s>
<s>  in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more
affection than she feels </s>
<s>  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly </s>
<s>  but he
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on </s>
<s> 

but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow </s>
<s>  if i can
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too </s>
<s> 

remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do </s>
<s> 

but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal
it he must find it out </s>
<s> 

perhaps he must if he sees enough of her </s>
<s>  but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together </s>
<s>  and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together </s>
<s>  jane should
therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his
attention </s>
<s>  when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses </s>
<s> 

your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined
to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it </s>
<s>  but
these are not janes feelings </s>
<s>  she is not acting by design </s>
<s>  as yet
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness </s>
<s>  she has known him only a fortnight </s>
<s>  she danced four
dances with him at meryton </s>
<s>  she saw him one morning at his own house
and has since dined with him in company four times </s>
<s>  this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character </s>
<s> 

not as you represent it </s>
<s>  had she merely dined with him she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite </s>
<s>  but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four
evenings may do a great deal </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like vingtun better than commerce </s>
<s>  but with respect to any other
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded </s>
<s> 

well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart </s>
<s>  and
if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth </s>
<s>  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance </s>
<s>  if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the
least </s>
<s>  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation </s>
<s>  and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life </s>
<s> 

you make me laugh charlotte </s>
<s>  but it is not sound </s>
<s>  you know it is not
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself </s>
<s> 

occupied in observing <abvr> bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty </s>
<s>  he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball </s>
<s>  and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise </s>
<s>  but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes </s>
<s>  to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying </s>
<s>  though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing </s>
<s>  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness </s>
<s>  of
this she was perfectly unaware </s>
<s>  to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with </s>
<s> 

he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing
with her himself attended to her conversation with others </s>
<s>  his doing so
drew her notice </s>
<s>  it was at sir william lucass where a large party were
assembled </s>
<s> 

what does <abvr> darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster </s>
<s> 

that is a question which <abvr> darcy only can answer </s>
<s> 

but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about </s>
<s>  he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him </s>
<s> 

on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him </s>
<s>  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she
turned to him and said </s>
<s> 

did you not think <abvr> darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly
well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton </s>
<s> 

with great energy </s>
<s>  but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic </s>
<s> 

you are severe on us </s>
<s> 

it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas </s>
<s>  i am going
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows </s>
<s> 

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend </s>
<s> always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody </s>
<s>  if my vanity had taken
a musical turn you would have been invaluable </s>
<s>  but as it is i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers </s>
<s>  on miss lucass persevering however
she added very well if it must be so it must </s>
<s>  and gravely glancing
at <abvr> darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of
course familiar with </s>
<s>  �keep your breath to cool your porridge </s>
<s>  and i
shall keep mine to swell my song </s>
<s> 

her performance was pleasing though by no means capital </s>
<s>  after a song
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always
impatient for display </s>
<s> 

mary had neither genius nor taste </s>
<s>  and though vanity had given her
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached </s>
<s>  elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with
much more pleasure though not playing half so well </s>
<s>  and mary at the
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who
with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was
his neighbour till sir william thus began </s>
<s> 

what a charming amusement for young people this is <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  there
is nothing like dancing after all </s>
<s>  i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society </s>
<s> 

certainly sir </s>
<s>  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world </s>
<s>  every savage can dance </s>
<s> 

sir william only smiled </s>
<s>  your friend performs delightfully he
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group </s>
<s>  and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir </s>
<s> 

yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight </s>
<s>  do
you often dance at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s> 

never sir </s>
<s> 

do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place </s>
<s> 

it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it </s>
<s> 

you have a house in town i conclude </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy bowed </s>
<s> 

i had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fond
of superior society </s>
<s>  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas </s>
<s> 

he paused in hopes of an answer </s>
<s>  but his companion was not disposed
to make any </s>
<s>  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to
her </s>
<s> 

my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner </s>
<s>  you
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you </s>
<s> 
 and taking her hand he would have given it to <abvr> darcy who though
extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william </s>
<s> 

indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing </s>
<s>  i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand but in vain </s>
<s>  elizabeth was determined </s>
<s>  nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion </s>
<s> 

you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you </s>
<s>  and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us
for one halfhour </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling </s>
<s> 

he is indeed </s>
<s>  but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza
we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a
partner </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked archly and turned away </s>
<s>  her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some
complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley </s>
<s> 

i can guess the subject of your reverie </s>
<s> 

i should imagine not </s>
<s> 

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this mannerin such society </s>
<s>  and indeed i am quite of your opinion </s>
<s> 
i was never more annoyed </s>
<s>  the insipidity and yet the noisethe
nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people </s>
<s>  what would
i give to hear your strictures on them </s>
<s> 

your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you </s>
<s>  my mind was more
agreeably engaged </s>
<s>  i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow </s>
<s> 

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  darcy replied with great intrepidity </s>
<s> 

miss elizabeth bennet </s>
<s> 

miss elizabeth bennet </s>
<s>  repeated miss bingley </s>
<s>  i am all astonishment </s>
<s> 
how long has she been such a favourite </s>
<s> and pray when am i to wish you
joy </s>
<s> 

that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask </s>
<s>  a ladys
imagination is very rapid </s>
<s>  it jumps from admiration to love from love
to matrimony in a moment </s>
<s>  i knew you would be wishing me joy </s>
<s> 

nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled </s>
<s>  you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed </s>
<s> 
and of course she will always be at pemberley with you </s>
<s> 

he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner </s>
<s>  and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe her wit flowed long </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed
in default of heirs male on a distant relation </s>
<s>  and their mothers
fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply
the deficiency of his </s>
<s>  her father had been an attorney in meryton and
had left her four thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

she had a sister married to a <abvr> phillips who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade </s>
<s> 

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton </s>
<s>  a most
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliners shop just over the way </s>
<s>  the two youngest of the family
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions </s>
<s> 
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing
better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening </s>
<s>  and however bare of news
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt </s>
<s>  at present indeed they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood </s>
<s>  it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the
headquarters </s>
<s> 

their visits to <abvr> phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence </s>
<s>  every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers names and connections </s>
<s>  their lodgings were not long a
secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves </s>
<s>  <abvr>
phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before </s>
<s>  they could talk of nothing but officers </s>
<s>  and
mr </s>
<s>  bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation
to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign </s>
<s> 

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject <abvr>
bennet coolly observed </s>
<s> 

from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country </s>
<s>  i have suspected it some time but
i am now convinced </s>
<s> 

catherine was disconcerted and made no answer </s>
<s>  but lydia with perfect
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the
next morning to london </s>
<s> 

i am astonished my dear said <abvr> bennet that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly </s>
<s>  if i wished to think slightingly
of anybodys children it should not be of my own however </s>
<s> 

if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it </s>
<s> 

yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever </s>
<s> 

this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree </s>
<s>  i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish </s>
<s> 

my dear <abvr> bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother </s>
<s>  when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do </s>
<s>  i remember the time when
i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my
heart </s>
<s>  and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year
should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him </s>
<s>  and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in
his regimentals </s>
<s> 

mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first
came </s>
<s>  she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for miss bennet </s>
<s>  it came from netherfield and the servant waited
for an answer </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was
eagerly calling out while her daughter read

well jane who is it from </s>
<s>  what is it about </s>
<s>  what does he say </s>
<s>  well
jane make haste and tell us </s>
<s>  make haste my love </s>
<s> 

it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud </s>
<s> 

my dear friend

if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives
for a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without a
quarrel </s>
<s>  come as soon as you can on receipt of this </s>
<s>  my brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers </s>
<s> yours ever

caroline bingley

with the officers </s>
<s>  cried lydia </s>
<s>  i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
that </s>
<s> 

dining out said <abvr> bennet that is very unlucky </s>
<s> 

can i have the carriage </s>
<s>  said jane </s>
<s> 

no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to
rain </s>
<s>  and then you must stay all night </s>
<s> 

that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but the gentlemen will have <abvr> bingleys chaise to go to meryton
and the hursts have no horses to theirs </s>
<s> 

i had much rather go in the coach </s>
<s> 

but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure </s>
<s>  they are
wanted in the farm <abvr> bennet are they not </s>
<s> 

they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them </s>
<s> 

but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose
will be answered </s>
<s> 

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged </s>
<s>  jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day </s>
<s>  her hopes were answered </s>
<s>  jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard </s>
<s>  her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was
delighted </s>
<s>  the rain continued the whole evening without intermission </s>
<s> 
jane certainly could not come back </s>
<s> 

this was a lucky idea of mine indeed </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bennet more than
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own </s>
<s>  till the
next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance </s>
<s>  breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth </s>
<s> 

my dearest lizzy

i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday </s>
<s>  my kind friends will not
hear of my returning till i am better </s>
<s>  they insist also on my seeing <abvr>
jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the
matter with me </s>
<s> yours etc </s>
<s> 

well my dear said <abvr> bennet when elizabeth had read the note
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr </s>
<s>  bingley and under your orders </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i am not afraid of her dying </s>
<s>  people do not die of little trifling
colds </s>
<s>  she will be taken good care of </s>
<s>  as long as she stays there it is
all very well </s>
<s>  i would go and see her if i could have the carriage </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though
the carriage was not to be had </s>
<s>  and as she was no horsewoman walking
was her only alternative </s>
<s>  she declared her resolution </s>
<s> 

how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a
thing in all this dirt </s>
<s>  you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there </s>
<s> 

i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want </s>
<s> 

is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the
horses </s>
<s> 

no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk </s>
<s>  the distance is nothing
when one has a motive </s>
<s>  only three miles </s>
<s>  i shall be back by dinner </s>
<s> 

i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason </s>
<s>  and in my opinion
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required </s>
<s> 

we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia </s>
<s> 
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off
together </s>
<s> 

if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes </s>
<s> 

in meryton they parted </s>
<s>  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last
within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise </s>
<s> 

she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise </s>
<s> 
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to <abvr> hurst and
miss bingley </s>
<s>  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it </s>
<s>  she was received however very politely by them </s>
<s>  and in their
brothers manners there was something better than politeness </s>
<s>  there
was good humour and kindness </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy said very little and <abvr>
hurst nothing at all </s>
<s>  the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as
to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone </s>
<s>  the latter was
thinking only of his breakfast </s>
<s> 

her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered </s>
<s>  miss
bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not
well enough to leave her room </s>
<s>  elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately </s>
<s>  and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance </s>
<s>  she was not equal
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them
together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with </s>
<s>  elizabeth silently attended
her </s>
<s> 

when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane </s>
<s>  the apothecary came and having
examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught
a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it </s>
<s> 
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts </s>
<s>  the advice
was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head
ached acutely </s>
<s>  elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment </s>
<s>  nor were
the other ladies often absent </s>
<s>  the gentlemen being out they had in
fact nothing to do elsewhere </s>
<s> 

when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very
unwillingly said so </s>
<s>  miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present </s>
<s> 
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to
longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes </s>
<s> 



chapter 


at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner </s>
<s>  to the civil inquiries which then
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of <abvr> bingleys she could not make a very
favourable answer </s>
<s>  jane was by no means better </s>
<s>  the sisters on hearing
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how
shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves </s>
<s>  and then thought no more of the matter </s>
<s>  and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike </s>
<s> 

their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency </s>
<s>  his anxiety for jane was evident and his
attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others </s>
<s>  she had very little notice from any but him </s>
<s>  miss bingley was
engrossed by <abvr> darcy her sister scarcely less so </s>
<s>  and as for <abvr>
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to
eat drink and play at cards </s>
<s>  who when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her </s>
<s> 

when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room </s>
<s>  her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence </s>
<s> 
she had no conversation no style no beauty </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst thought the
same and added </s>
<s> 

she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent
walker </s>
<s>  i shall never forget her appearance this morning </s>
<s>  she really
looked almost wild </s>
<s> 

she did indeed louisa </s>
<s>  i could hardly keep my countenance </s>
<s>  very
nonsensical to come at all </s>
<s>  why must she be scampering about the
country because her sister had a cold </s>
<s>  her hair so untidy so blowsy </s>
<s> 

yes and her petticoat </s>
<s>  i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep
in mud i am absolutely certain </s>
<s>  and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office </s>
<s> 

your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley </s>
<s>  but this was
all lost upon me </s>
<s>  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning </s>
<s>  her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice </s>
<s> 

you observed it <abvr> darcy i am sure said miss bingley </s>
<s>  and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
an exhibition </s>
<s> 

certainly not </s>
<s> 

to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is
above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone </s>
<s>  what could she mean by
it </s>
<s>  it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence
a most countrytown indifference to decorum </s>
<s> 

it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said
bingley </s>
<s> 

i am afraid <abvr> darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes </s>
<s> 

not at all he replied </s>
<s>  they were brightened by the exercise </s>
<s>  a
short pause followed this speech and <abvr> hurst began again </s>
<s> 

i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very
sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled </s>
<s>  but with
such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is
no chance of it </s>
<s> 

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside </s>
<s> 

that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily </s>
<s> 

if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it
would not make them one jot less agreeable </s>
<s> 

but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world replied darcy </s>
<s> 

to this speech bingley made no answer </s>
<s>  but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friends vulgar relations </s>
<s> 

with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on
leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee </s>
<s> 
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till
late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself </s>
<s>  on entering the drawingroom she found the whole
party at loo and was immediately invited to join them </s>
<s>  but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst looked at her with astonishment </s>
<s> 

do you prefer reading to cards </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  that is rather singular </s>
<s> 

miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards </s>
<s>  she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else </s>
<s> 

i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i am
not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things </s>
<s> 

in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley </s>
<s>  and
i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well </s>
<s> 

elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying </s>
<s>  he immediately offered to fetch her
othersall that his library afforded </s>
<s> 

and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit </s>
<s>  but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more
than i ever looked into </s>
<s> 

elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room </s>
<s> 

i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left
so small a collection of books </s>
<s>  what a delightful library you have at
pemberley <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many
generations </s>
<s> 

and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying
books </s>
<s> 

i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these </s>
<s> 

neglect </s>
<s>  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place </s>
<s>  charles when you build your house i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley </s>
<s> 

i wish it may </s>
<s> 

but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model </s>
<s>  there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire </s>
<s> 

with all my heart </s>
<s>  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it </s>
<s> 

i am talking of possibilities charles </s>
<s> 

upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very
little attention for her book </s>
<s>  and soon laying it wholly aside she drew
near the cardtable and stationed herself between <abvr> bingley and his
eldest sister to observe the game </s>
<s> 

is miss darcy much grown since the spring </s>
<s>  said miss bingley </s>
<s>  will
she be as tall as i am </s>
<s> 

i think she will </s>
<s>  she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or
rather taller </s>
<s> 

how i long to see her again </s>
<s>  i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much </s>
<s>  such a countenance such manners </s>
<s>  and so extremely accomplished
for her age </s>
<s>  her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite </s>
<s> 

it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are </s>
<s> 

all young ladies accomplished </s>
<s>  my dear charles what do you mean </s>
<s> 

yes all of them i think </s>
<s>  they all paint tables cover screens and
net purses </s>
<s>  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure
i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being
informed that she was very accomplished </s>
<s> 

your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has
too much truth </s>
<s>  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen </s>
<s>  but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general </s>
<s>  i
cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished </s>
<s> 

nor i i am sure said miss bingley </s>
<s> 

then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman </s>
<s> 

yes i do comprehend a great deal in it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with </s>
<s>  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word </s>
<s>  and besides
all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word
will be but halfdeserved </s>
<s> 

all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading </s>
<s> 

i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women </s>
<s>

<s> 

are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this </s>
<s> 

i never saw such a woman </s>
<s>  i never saw such capacity and taste and
application and elegance as you describe united </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description when <abvr> hurst called them to order with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward </s>

conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room </s>

elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her

other sex by undervaluing their own </s>
<s>  and with many men i dare say it
succeeds </s>
<s>  but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed
there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation </s>
<s>  whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable </s>

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to

that <abvr> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet
were not decidedly better </s>

declared that they were miserable </s>

chapter 


elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from <abvr> bingley by a housemaid
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters </s>
<s>  in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her
own judgement of her situation </s>
<s>  the note was immediately dispatched and
its contents as quickly complied with </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet accompanied by her
two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast </s>
<s> 

had she found jane in any apparent danger <abvr> bennet would have been
very miserable </s>
<s>  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield </s>
<s>  she
would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried
home </s>
<s>  neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think
it at all advisable </s>
<s>  after sitting a little while with jane on miss
bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour </s>
<s>  bingley met them with hopes
that <abvr> bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected </s>
<s> 

indeed i have sir was her answer </s>
<s>  she is a great deal too ill to be
moved </s>
<s>  <abvr> jones says we must not think of moving her </s>
<s>  we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness </s>
<s> 

removed </s>
<s>  cried bingley </s>
<s>  it must not be thought of </s>
<s>  my sister i am
sure will not hear of her removal </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility
that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments </s>
<s> 

i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers
a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest
temper i have ever met with </s>
<s>  i often tell my other girls they are
nothing to her </s>
<s>  you have a sweet room here <abvr> bingley and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk </s>
<s>  i do not know a place in the
country that is equal to netherfield </s>
<s>  you will not think of quitting it
in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease </s>
<s> 

whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he </s>
<s>  and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five
minutes </s>
<s>  at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here </s>
<s> 

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth </s>
<s> 

you begin to comprehend me do you </s>
<s>  cried he turning towards her </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesi understand you perfectly </s>
<s> 

i wish i might take this for a compliment </s>
<s>  but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful </s>
<s> 

that is as it happens </s>
<s>  it does not follow that a deep intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours </s>
<s> 

lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home </s>
<s> 

i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a
studier of character </s>
<s>  it must be an amusing study </s>
<s> 

yes but intricate characters are the most amusing </s>
<s>  they have at
least that advantage </s>
<s> 

the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study </s>
<s>  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society </s>
<s> 

but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever </s>
<s> 

yes indeed cried <abvr> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood </s>
<s>  i assure you there is quite as much of that
going on in the country as in town </s>
<s> 

everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment
turned silently away </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him continued her triumph </s>
<s> 

i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part except the shops and public places </s>
<s>  the country is a vast deal
pleasanter is it not <abvr> bingley </s>
<s> 

when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it </s>
<s> 
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same </s>
<s>  they have each their
advantages and i can be equally happy in either </s>
<s> 

ayethat is because you have the right disposition </s>
<s>  but that
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing
at all </s>
<s> 

indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her
mother </s>
<s>  you quite mistook <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town
which you must acknowledge to be true </s>
<s> 

certainly my dear nobody said there were </s>
<s>  but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger </s>
<s>  i know we dine with fourandtwenty families </s>
<s> 

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance </s>
<s>  his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards
mr </s>
<s>  darcy with a very expressive smile </s>
<s>  elizabeth for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away </s>
<s> 

yes she called yesterday with her father </s>
<s>  what an agreeable man sir
william is <abvr> bingley is not he </s>
<s>  so much the man of fashion </s>
<s>  so
genteel and easy </s>
<s>  he has always something to say to everybody </s>
<s>  that
is my idea of good breeding </s>
<s>  and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter </s>
<s> 

did charlotte dine with you </s>
<s> 

no she would go home </s>
<s>  i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies </s>
<s>  for
my part <abvr> bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work </s>
<s> 
my daughters are brought up very differently </s>
<s>  but everybody is to
judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls
i assure you </s>
<s>  it is a pity they are not handsome </s>
<s>  not that i think
charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend </s>
<s> 

she seems a very pleasant young woman </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear yes </s>
<s>  but you must own she is very plain </s>
<s>  lady lucas herself
has often said so and envied me janes beauty </s>
<s>  i do not like to boast
of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody
better looking </s>
<s>  it is what everybody says </s>
<s>  i do not trust my own
partiality </s>
<s>  when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother
gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away </s>
<s>  but however he
did not </s>
<s>  perhaps he thought her too young </s>
<s>  however he wrote some verses
on her and very pretty they were </s>
<s> 

and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently </s>
<s>  there has
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way </s>
<s>  i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love </s>
<s> 

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy </s>
<s> 

of a fine stout healthy love it may </s>
<s>  everything nourishes what is
strong already </s>
<s>  but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away </s>
<s> 

darcy only smiled </s>
<s>  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again </s>
<s>  she longed to
speak but could think of nothing to say </s>
<s>  and after a short silence <abvr>
bennet began repeating her thanks to <abvr> bingley for his kindness to
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be
civil also and say what the occasion required </s>
<s>  she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness but <abvr> bennet was satisfied and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage </s>
<s>  upon this signal the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward </s>
<s>  the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the
youngest should tax <abvr> bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield </s>
<s> 

lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion
and goodhumoured countenance </s>
<s>  a favourite with her mother whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age </s>
<s>  she had high
animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the
attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance </s>
<s>  she was very
equal therefore to address <abvr> bingley on the subject of the ball and
abruptly reminded him of his promise </s>
<s>  adding that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it </s>
<s>  his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement </s>
<s>  and when
your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball </s>
<s>  but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill </s>
<s> 

lydia declared herself satisfied </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  yesit would be much better to
wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again </s>
<s>  and when you have given your ball she
added i shall insist on their giving one also </s>
<s>  i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  the latter of whom however
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of
all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the day passed much as the day before had done </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who
continued though slowly to mend </s>
<s>  and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawingroom </s>
<s>  the lootable however did not appear </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and <abvr> bingley were at piquet and
mrs </s>
<s>  hurst was observing their game </s>
<s> 

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion </s>
<s>  the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each </s>
<s> 

how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter </s>
<s> 

he made no answer </s>
<s> 

you write uncommonly fast </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken </s>
<s>  i write rather slowly </s>
<s> 

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year </s>
<s>  letters of business too </s>
<s>  how odious i should think them </s>
<s> 

it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours </s>
<s> 

pray tell your sister that i long to see her </s>
<s> 

i have already told her so once by your desire </s>
<s> 

i am afraid you do not like your pen </s>
<s>  let me mend it for you </s>
<s>  i mend
pens remarkably well </s>
<s> 

thank youbut i always mend my own </s>
<s> 

how can you contrive to write so even </s>
<s> 

he was silent </s>
<s> 

tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp </s>
<s> 
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantleys </s>
<s> 

will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again </s>
<s>  at
present i have not room to do them justice </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  it is of no consequence </s>
<s>  i shall see her in january </s>
<s>  but do you
always write such charming long letters to her <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

they are generally long </s>
<s>  but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine </s>
<s> 

it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill </s>
<s> 

that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her
brother because he does not write with ease </s>
<s>  he studies too much for
words of four syllables </s>
<s>  do not you darcy </s>
<s> 

my style of writing is very different from yours </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable </s>
<s>  he leaves out half his words and blots the rest </s>
<s> 

my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents </s>
<s> 

your humility <abvr> bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof </s>
<s> 

nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of
humility </s>
<s>  it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an
indirect boast </s>
<s> 

and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty </s>
<s> 

the indirect boast </s>
<s>  for you are really proud of your defects in
writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you
think at least highly interesting </s>
<s>  the power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance </s>
<s>  when you told <abvr>
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else </s>
<s> 

nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning </s>
<s>  and yet upon my honour
i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this
moment </s>
<s>  at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies </s>
<s> 

i dare say you believed it </s>
<s>  but i am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity </s>
<s>  your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know </s>
<s>  and if as you were
mounting your horse a friend were to say �bingley you had better
stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not
goand at another word might stay a month </s>
<s> 

you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <abvr> bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition </s>
<s>  you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself </s>
<s> 

i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper </s>
<s>  but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend </s>
<s>  for he would certainly think better of me if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
could </s>
<s> 

would <abvr> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it </s>
<s> 

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter </s>
<s>  darcy must speak for
himself </s>
<s> 

you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine
but which i have never acknowledged </s>
<s>  allowing the case however to
stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and
the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety </s>
<s> 

to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit
with you </s>
<s> 

to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either </s>
<s> 

you appear to me <abvr> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection </s>
<s>  a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it </s>
<s>  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  we may as well wait perhaps till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon </s>
<s>  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire without waiting to be argued into it </s>
<s> 

will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties </s>
<s> 

by all means cried bingley </s>
<s>  let us hear all the particulars not
forgetting their comparative height and size </s>
<s>  for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of </s>
<s>  i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with
myself i should not pay him half so much deference </s>
<s>  i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in
particular places </s>
<s>  at his own house especially and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy smiled </s>
<s>  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh </s>
<s>  miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense </s>
<s> 

i see your design bingley said his friend </s>
<s>  you dislike an argument
and want to silence this </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do </s>
<s>  arguments are too much like disputes </s>
<s>  if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very
thankful </s>
<s>  and then you may say whatever you like of me </s>
<s> 

what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
darcy had much better finish his letter </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy took her advice and did finish his letter </s>
<s> 

when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music </s>
<s>  miss bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte </s>
<s>  and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she
seated herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks
that lay on the instrument how frequently <abvr> darcys eyes were fixed
on her </s>
<s>  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man </s>
<s>  and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her was still more strange </s>
<s>  she could only imagine
however at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in
any other person present </s>
<s>  the supposition did not pain her </s>
<s>  she liked
him too little to care for his approbation </s>
<s> 

after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by
a lively scotch air </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards <abvr> darcy drawing near
elizabeth said to her </s>
<s> 

do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel </s>
<s> 

she smiled but made no answer </s>
<s>  he repeated the question with some
surprise at her silence </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said she i heard you before but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply </s>
<s>  you wanted me i know to say �yes
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste </s>
<s>  but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt </s>
<s>  i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if
you dare </s>
<s> 

indeed i do not dare </s>
<s> 

elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his
gallantry </s>
<s>  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody </s>
<s>  and darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her </s>
<s>  he really
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he
should be in some danger </s>
<s> 

miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous </s>
<s>  and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth </s>
<s> 

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance </s>
<s> 

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this
desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue </s>
<s> 
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after
officers </s>
<s>  and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence
which your lady possesses </s>
<s> 

have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley </s>
<s>  put them next to your greatuncle the
judge </s>
<s>  they are in the same profession you know only in different
lines </s>
<s>  as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes </s>
<s> 

it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their
colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be
copied </s>
<s> 

at that moment they were met from another walk by <abvr> hurst and
elizabeth herself </s>
<s> 

i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some
confusion lest they had been overheard </s>
<s> 

you used us abominably ill answered <abvr> hurst running away without
telling us that you were coming out </s>
<s> 

then taking the disengaged arm of <abvr> darcy she left elizabeth to walk
by herself </s>
<s>  the path just admitted three </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said </s>
<s> 

this walk is not wide enough for our party </s>
<s>  we had better go into the
avenue </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them
laughingly answered </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  stay where you are </s>
<s>  you are charmingly grouped and appear
to uncommon advantage </s>
<s>  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s> 

she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two </s>
<s>  jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening </s>
<s> 



chapter 


when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her
sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the
drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure </s>
<s>  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared </s>
<s> 
their powers of conversation were considerable </s>
<s>  they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit </s>
<s> 

but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object </s>
<s> 
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps </s>
<s>  he addressed
himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst also
made her a slight bow and said he was very glad </s>
<s>  but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation </s>
<s>  he was full of joy and
attention </s>
<s>  the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she
should suffer from the change of room </s>
<s>  and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from
the door </s>
<s>  he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone
else </s>
<s>  elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great
delight </s>
<s> 

when tea was over <abvr> hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the
cardtablebut in vain </s>
<s>  she had obtained private intelligence that <abvr>
darcy did not wish for cards </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected </s>
<s>  she assured him that no one intended to play and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her </s>
<s>  <abvr>
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep </s>
<s>  darcy took up a book </s>
<s>  miss bingley did the same </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss
bennet </s>
<s> 

miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching <abvr>
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own </s>
<s>  and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page </s>
<s>  she
could not win him however to any conversation </s>
<s>  he merely answered her
question and read on </s>
<s>  at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way </s>
<s>  i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading </s>
<s>  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book </s>
<s>  when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library </s>
<s> 

no one made any reply </s>
<s>  she then yawned again threw aside her book and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement </s>
<s>  when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly
towards him and said </s>
<s> 

by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield </s>
<s>  i would advise you before you determine on it to consult
the wishes of the present party </s>
<s>  i am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure </s>
<s>

chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled
thing </s>
<s>  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
round my cards </s>
<s> 

i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were
carried on in a different manner </s>
<s>  but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting </s>
<s>  it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day </s>
<s> 

much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be
near so much like a ball </s>
<s> 

miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room </s>
<s>  her figure was elegant and she walked well </s>
<s>  but
darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious </s>
<s>  in
the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and
turning to elizabeth said </s>
<s> 

miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a
turn about the room </s>
<s>  i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately </s>
<s>  miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy looked
up </s>
<s>  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book </s>
<s>  he was
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere </s>
<s>  what could he mean </s>
<s>  she was dying to know what could be his
meaning </s>
<s> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him </s>
<s> 

not at all was her answer </s>
<s>  but depend upon it he means to be severe
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it </s>
<s> 

miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <abvr> darcy in
anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives </s>
<s> 

i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon
as she allowed him to speak </s>
<s>  you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking </s>

completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire </s>

abominable </s>
<s>  how shall we punish him for such a speech </s>

nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth </s>

mr </s>

<s>  that is an
uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances </s>

miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be </s>
<s> 
the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their
actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke </s>
<s> 

certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i
am not one of them </s>
<s>  i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good </s>
<s> 
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own
and i laugh at them whenever i can </s>
<s>  but these i suppose are precisely
what you are without </s>
<s> 

perhaps that is not possible for anyone </s>
<s>  but it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule </s>
<s> 

such as vanity and pride </s>
<s> 

yes vanity is a weakness indeed </s>
<s>  but pridewhere there is a real
superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation </s>
<s> 

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile </s>
<s> 

your examination of <abvr> darcy is over i presume said miss bingley </s>

and pray what is the result </s>

i am perfectly convinced by it that <abvr> darcy has no defect </s>

himself without disguise </s>
<s> 

no said darcy i have made no such pretension </s>
<s>  i have faults enough
but they are not i hope of understanding </s>
<s>  my temper i dare not vouch
for </s>
<s>  it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the
convenience of the world </s>
<s>  i cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself </s>

are not puffed about with every attempt to move them </s>

would perhaps be called resentful </s>
<s>  my good opinion once lost is lost
forever </s>

that is a failing indeed </s>

<s>  implacable resentment
is a shade in a character </s>
<s>  but you have chosen your fault well </s>
<s>  i
really cannot laugh at it </s>
<s>  you are safe from me </s>
<s> 

there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evila natural defect which not even the best education can overcome </s>

and your defect is to hate everybody </s>

them </s>

do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a
conversation in which she had no share </s>

her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was
opened </s>

it </s>

chapter 


in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for

very well </s>
<s>  against staying longer however elizabeth was positively
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked </s>
<s>  and fearful on the
contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long
she urged jane to borrow <abvr> bingleys carriage immediately and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned and the request made </s>
<s> 

the communication excited many professions of concern </s>
<s>  and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on jane </s>
<s>  and till the morrow their going was deferred </s>
<s>  miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other </s>
<s> 

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for herthat she was not enough recovered </s>
<s>  but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough </s>
<s>  she attracted him more than he likedand miss
bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself </s>

he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration

of influencing his felicity </s>

suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it </s>
<s>  steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were
at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her </s>

on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost
all took place </s>
<s>  miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly as well as her affection for jane </s>
<s>  and when they parted
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most
tenderly she even shook hands with the former </s>
<s>  elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits </s>

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother </s>

wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much

<s> 

it is not <abvr> bingley said her husband </s>
<s>  it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life </s>
<s> 

this roused a general astonishment </s>
<s>  and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once </s>
<s> 

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained </s>
<s> 

about a month ago i received this letter </s>
<s>  and about a fortnight ago
i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring
early attention </s>
<s>  it is from my cousin <abvr> collins who when i am dead
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned </s>
<s> 
pray do not talk of that odious man </s>
<s>  i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children </s>
<s>  and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it </s>
<s> 

jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail </s>
<s>  they
had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about </s>
<s> 

it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said <abvr> bennet and
nothing can clear <abvr> collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn </s>
<s> 
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself </s>
<s> 

no that i am sure i shall not </s>
<s>  and i think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all and very hypocritical </s>
<s>  i hate such false
friends </s>
<s>  why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did
before him </s>
<s> 

why indeed </s>
<s>  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head as you will hear </s>
<s>

<s> 

dear sir

the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the
misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach </s>
<s>  but
for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance </s>
<s> �there <abvr>
bennet </s>
<s> my mind however is now made up on the subject for having
received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de
bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the church of england </s>
<s>  as a clergyman moreover i
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence </s>
<s>  and on these grounds i
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the
offered olivebranch </s>
<s>  i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for
it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amendsbut of this hereafter </s>
<s>  if you should have no objection to
receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight
following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day </s>
<s> i
remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters your wellwisher and friend

william collins

at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman
 said <abvr> bennet as he folded up the letter </s>
<s>  he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again </s>
<s> 

there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if
he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to
discourage him </s>
<s> 

though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his
credit </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required </s>
<s> 

he must be an oddity i think said she </s>
<s>  i cannot make him
out </s>
<s> there is something very pompous in his style </s>
<s> and what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail </s>
<s> we cannot suppose he
would help it if he could </s>
<s> could he be a sensible man sir </s>
<s> 

no my dear i think not </s>
<s>  i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse </s>
<s>  there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his
letter which promises well </s>
<s>  i am impatient to see him </s>
<s> 

in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem
defective </s>
<s>  the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet i
think it is well expressed </s>
<s> 

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting </s>
<s>  it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour </s>
<s>  as for
their mother <abvr> collinss letter had done away much of her illwill
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins was punctual to his time and was received with great
politeness by the whole family </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet indeed said little </s>
<s>  but the
ladies were ready enough to talk and <abvr> collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself </s>
<s>  he was a
tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty </s>
<s>  his air was grave and
stately and his manners were very formal </s>
<s>  he had not been long seated
before he complimented <abvr> bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters </s>
<s>  said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth </s>
<s>  and added that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage </s>
<s>  this
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily </s>
<s> 

you are very kind i am sure </s>
<s>  and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so for else they will be destitute enough </s>
<s>  things are settled so
oddly </s>
<s> 

you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  sir i do indeed </s>
<s>  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you
must confess </s>
<s>  not that i mean to find fault with you for such things
i know are all chance in this world </s>
<s>  there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed </s>
<s> 

i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate </s>
<s>  but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them </s>
<s>  at present i will not say more </s>

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner </s>

other </s>

<s>  the
hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised </s>
<s> 
and his commendation of everything would have touched <abvr> bennets
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his

he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing </s>

chapter 


during dinner <abvr> bennet scarcely spoke at all </s>
<s>  but when the servants
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness </s>
<s>  lady
catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for
his comfort appeared very remarkable </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could not have chosen
better </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was eloquent in her praise </s>
<s>  the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine </s>
<s>  she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her </s>
<s>  she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings
and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening </s>
<s>  lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her </s>
<s> 
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman </s>
<s>  she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations </s>
<s>  she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion </s>
<s>  and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs </s>
<s> 

that is all very proper and civil i am sure said <abvr> bennet and
i dare say she is a very agreeable woman </s>
<s>  it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her </s>
<s>  does she live near you sir </s>
<s> 

the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park her ladyships residence </s>
<s> 

i think you said she was a widow sir </s>
<s>  has she any family </s>
<s> 

she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very
extensive property </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> bennet shaking her head then she is better off than
many girls </s>
<s>  and what sort of young lady is she </s>
<s>  is she handsome </s>
<s> 

she is a most charming young lady indeed </s>
<s>  lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth </s>
<s>  she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still
resides with them </s>
<s>  but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies </s>
<s> 

has she been presented </s>
<s>  i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court </s>
<s> 

her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town </s>
<s> 
and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the
british court of its brightest ornament </s>
<s>  her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea </s>
<s>  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies </s>
<s>  i have more than once observed to lady catherine that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by
her </s>
<s>  these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay </s>
<s> 

you judge very properly said <abvr> bennet and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy </s>
<s>  may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment or are the result of previous study </s>
<s> 

they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennets expectations were fully answered </s>
<s>  his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance

by teatime however the dose had been enough and <abvr> bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins readily
assented and a book was produced </s>
<s>  but on beholding it for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and
begging pardon protested that he never read novels </s>
<s>  kitty stared at
him and lydia exclaimed </s>
<s>  other books were produced and after some
deliberation he chose fordyces sermons </s>
<s>  lydia gaped as he opened the
volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three
pages she interrupted him with </s>
<s> 

do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away
richard </s>
<s>  and if he does colonel forster will hire him </s>
<s>  my aunt told me
so herself on saturday </s>
<s>  i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more
about it and to ask when <abvr> denny comes back from town </s>
<s> 

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
collins much offended laid aside his book and said </s>
<s> 

i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit </s>
<s>  it amazes
me i confess </s>
<s>  for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction </s>
<s>  but i will no longer importune my young cousin </s>
<s> 

then turning to <abvr> bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would
resume his book </s>

young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront seated himself at another table with <abvr> bennet and prepared
for backgammon </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society </s>
<s>  the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father </s>
<s>  and though he belonged to one of the universities he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance </s>
<s>  the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner </s>
<s>  but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity </s>
<s>  a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant </s>
<s>  and the respect which
he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a
clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility </s>
<s> 

having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to
marry </s>
<s>  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report </s>
<s> 
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers
estate </s>
<s>  and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part </s>
<s> 

his plan did not vary on seeing them </s>
<s>  miss bennets lovely face
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority </s>
<s>  and for the first evening she was his settled
choice </s>
<s>  the next morning however made an alteration </s>
<s>  for in a
quarter of an hours teteatete with <abvr> bennet before breakfast a
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at
longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on </s>
<s>  as to
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could
not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession </s>
<s>  her
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her

him after breakfast </s>

doings discomposed <abvr> bennet exceedingly </s>

always sure of leisure and tranquillity </s>

elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house he was used to be free from them there </s>
<s>  his civility therefore
was most prompt in inviting <abvr> collins to join his daughters in their
walk </s>

in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton </s>
<s>  the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him </s>

immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in
a shop window could recall them </s>

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking
with another officer on the other side of the way </s>

the very <abvr> denny concerning whose return from london lydia came
to inquire and he bowed as they passed </s>

determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had
reached the same spot </s>
<s>  <abvr> denny addressed them directly and entreated
permission to introduce his friend <abvr> wickham who had returned with
him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps </s>
<s>  this was exactly as it should be </s>
<s>  for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming </s>
<s> 
his appearance was greatly in his favour </s>
<s>  he had all the best part of
beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address </s>
<s> 
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming </s>
<s>  and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy
and bingley were seen riding down the street </s>

ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and
began the usual civilities </s>

miss bennet the principal object </s>
<s>  he was then he said on his way to
longbourn on purpose to inquire after her </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy corroborated
it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting </s>
<s> 
both changed colour one looked white the other red </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham
after a few moments touched his hata salutation which <abvr> darcy just
deigned to return </s>

imagine </s>

<s> 

in another minute <abvr> bingley but without seeming to have noticed what
passed took leave and rode on with his friend </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  denny and <abvr> wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr </s>
<s>  phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias
pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of
mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation </s>

mrs </s>
<s>  phillips was always glad to see her nieces </s>
<s>  and the two eldest
from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as
their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing
about if she had not happened to see <abvr> joness shopboy in the
street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility
was claimed towards <abvr> collins by janes introduction of him </s>

received him with her very best politeness which he returned with
as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous
acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself

introduced him to her notice </s>
<s>  <abvr> phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding </s>
<s>  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other </s>
<s>  of whom
however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that
mr </s>
<s>  denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a
lieutenants commission in the shire </s>
<s>  she had been watching him the
last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had <abvr>

occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid
disagreeable fellows </s>
<s>  some of them were to dine with the phillipses
the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on <abvr>
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening </s>
<s>  this was agreed to and <abvr> phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards </s>
<s>  the prospect of such
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless </s>

between the two gentlemen </s>
<s>  but though jane would have defended either

such behaviour than her sister </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins on his return highly gratified <abvr> bennet by admiring
mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss manners and politeness </s>
<s>  he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman </s>
<s> 
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although
utterly unknown to her before </s>

chapter 


as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their
aunt and all <abvr> collinss scruples of leaving <abvr> and <abvr> bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton </s>
<s>  and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom
that <abvr> wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in
the house </s>
<s> 

when this information was given and they had all taken their seats <abvr>
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at rosings </s>
<s>  a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification </s>
<s>  but when <abvr> phillips understood from him what
rosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all
the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeepers room </s>
<s> 

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and
the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them </s>
<s>  and he found in <abvr> phillips a very attentive
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could </s>
<s>  to the girls who could not listen to their cousin
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the
interval of waiting appeared very long </s>
<s>  it was over at last however </s>
<s> 
the gentlemen did approach and when <abvr> wickham walked into the room
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration </s>
<s> 
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and
walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips
breathing port wine who followed them into the room </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself </s>
<s>  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel
that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker </s>
<s> 

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as <abvr> wickham and the
officers <abvr> collins seemed to sink into insignificance </s>
<s>  to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing </s>
<s>  but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in <abvr> phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin </s>
<s>  when the cardtables were placed he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist </s>
<s> 

i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad
to improve myself for in my situation in life <abvr> phillips was very
glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia </s>
<s>  at first there
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most
determined talker </s>
<s>  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular </s>
<s> 
allowing for the common demands of the game <abvr> wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear
him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
toldthe history of his acquaintance with <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  she dared not
even mention that gentleman </s>
<s>  her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham began the subject himself </s>
<s>  he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton </s>
<s>  and after receiving her answer asked in
a hesitating manner how long <abvr> darcy had been staying there </s>
<s> 

about a month said elizabeth </s>
<s>  and then unwilling to let the subject
drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i
understand </s>
<s> 

yes replied <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  his estate there is a noble one </s>
<s>  a clear
ten thousand per annum </s>
<s>  you could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for
i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not but look surprised </s>
<s> 

you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after
seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday </s>
<s>  are you much acquainted with <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly </s>
<s>  i have
spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being
agreeable or otherwise </s>
<s>  i am not qualified to form one </s>
<s>  i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge </s>
<s>  it is impossible for me
to be impartial </s>
<s>  but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else </s>
<s>  here you are in your own family </s>
<s> 

upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in
the neighbourhood except netherfield </s>
<s>  he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire </s>
<s>  everybody is disgusted with his pride </s>
<s>  you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone </s>
<s> 

i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short
interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts </s>
<s>  but with him i believe it does not often happen </s>
<s>  the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen </s>
<s> 

i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an
illtempered man </s>
<s>  wickham only shook his head </s>
<s> 

i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer </s>
<s> 

i do not at all know </s>
<s>  but i heard nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield </s>
<s>  i hope your plans in favour of the shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  noit is not for me to be driven away by <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  if he
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go </s>
<s>  we are not on friendly terms
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for
avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense
of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he
is </s>
<s>  his father miss bennet the late <abvr> darcy was one of the best men
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had </s>
<s>  and i can never
be in company with this <abvr> darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections </s>
<s>  his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous </s>
<s>  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father </s>
<s> 

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with
all her heart </s>
<s>  but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry </s>
<s> 

it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire </s>
<s>  i knew it to be
a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them </s>
<s> 
society i own is necessary to me </s>
<s>  i have been a disappointed man and
my spirits will not bear solitude </s>
<s>  i must have employment and society </s>
<s> 
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have
now made it eligible </s>
<s>  the church ought to have been my professioni
was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

yesthe late <abvr> darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift </s>
<s>  he was my godfather and excessively attached to me </s>
<s> 
i cannot do justice to his kindness </s>
<s>  he meant to provide for me amply
and thought he had done it </s>
<s>  but when the living fell it was given
elsewhere </s>
<s> 

good heavens </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  but how could that be </s>
<s>  how could his
will be disregarded </s>
<s>  why did you not seek legal redress </s>
<s> 

there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law </s>
<s>  a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention but <abvr> darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing </s>
<s>  certain
it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was
of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man </s>
<s>  and no
less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it </s>
<s>  i have a warm unguarded temper and
i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely </s>
<s>  i can
recall nothing worse </s>
<s>  but the fact is that we are very different sort
of men and that he hates me </s>
<s> 

this is quite shocking </s>
<s>  he deserves to be publicly disgraced </s>
<s> 

some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me </s>
<s>  till i
can forget his father i can never defy or expose him </s>
<s> 

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them </s>
<s> 

but what said she after a pause can have been his motive </s>
<s>  what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly </s>
<s> 

a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy </s>
<s>  had the late <abvr> darcy liked me
less his son might have borne with me better </s>
<s>  but his fathers uncommon
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life </s>
<s>  he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort
of preference which was often given me </s>
<s> 

i had not thought <abvr> darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked
him </s>
<s>  i had not thought so very ill of him </s>
<s>  i had supposed him to be
despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as
this </s>
<s> 

after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do
remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of
his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper </s>
<s>  his disposition
must be dreadful </s>
<s> 

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham </s>
<s>  i can hardly
be just to him </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his
father </s>
<s>  she could have added a young man too like you whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself
with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood
connected together as i think you said in the closest manner </s>
<s> 

we were born in the same parish within the same park </s>
<s>  the greatest
part of our youth was passed together </s>
<s>  inmates of the same house
sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care </s>
<s>  my
father began life in the profession which your uncle <abvr> phillips
appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of
use to the late <abvr> darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property </s>
<s>  he was most highly esteemed by <abvr> darcy a most
intimate confidential friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence
and when immediately before my fathers death <abvr> darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself </s>
<s> 

how strange </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  how abominable </s>
<s>  i wonder that the very
pride of this <abvr> darcy has not made him just to you </s>
<s>  if from no better
motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor
dishonesty i must call it </s>
<s> 

it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride </s>
<s>  and pride had often been his best friend </s>
<s>  it has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling </s>
<s>  but we are
none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride </s>
<s> 

can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money
freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the
poor </s>
<s>  family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of what
his father washave done this </s>
<s>  not to appear to disgrace his family
to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the
pemberley house is a powerful motive </s>
<s>  he has also brotherly pride
which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers </s>
<s> 

what sort of girl is miss darcy </s>
<s> 

he shook his head </s>
<s>  i wish i could call her amiable </s>
<s>  it gives me pain to
speak ill of a darcy </s>
<s>  but she is too much like her brothervery very
proud </s>
<s>  as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond
of me </s>
<s>  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement </s>
<s>  but she is
nothing to me now </s>
<s>  she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen
and i understand highly accomplished </s>
<s>  since her fathers death her
home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her
education </s>
<s> 

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first and saying </s>
<s> 

i am astonished at his intimacy with <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  how can <abvr> bingley
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable
be in friendship with such a man </s>
<s>  how can they suit each other </s>
<s>  do you
know <abvr> bingley </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s> 

he is a sweettempered amiable charming man </s>
<s>  he cannot know what <abvr>
darcy is </s>
<s> 

probably not </s>
<s>  but <abvr> darcy can please where he chooses </s>
<s>  he does not
want abilities </s>
<s>  he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while </s>
<s>  among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous </s>
<s>  his
pride never deserts him </s>
<s>  but with the rich he is liberalminded just
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something
for fortune and figure </s>
<s> 

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round
the other table and <abvr> collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and <abvr> phillips </s>
<s>  the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter </s>
<s>  it had not been very great </s>
<s>  he had lost every
point </s>
<s>  but when <abvr> phillips began to express her concern thereupon
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy </s>
<s> 

i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a
cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object </s>
<s>  there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams attention was caught </s>
<s>  and after observing <abvr> collins for
a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh </s>
<s> 

lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him
a living </s>
<s>  i hardly know how <abvr> collins was first introduced to her
notice but he certainly has not known her long </s>
<s> 

you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters </s>
<s>  consequently that she is aunt to the present <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

no indeed i did not </s>
<s>  i knew nothing at all of lady catherines
connections </s>
<s>  i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday </s>
<s> 

her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates </s>
<s> 

this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss
bingley </s>
<s>  vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already
selfdestined for another </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter </s>
<s>  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his
patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman </s>
<s> 

i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham </s>
<s>  i have
not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked
her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent </s>
<s>  she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever </s>
<s>  but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her
nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class </s>
<s> 

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of <abvr>
wickhams attentions </s>
<s>  there could be no conversation in the noise
of <abvr> phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to
everybody </s>

gracefully </s>
<s>  elizabeth went away with her head full of him </s>
<s>  she could
think of nothing but of <abvr> wickham and of what he had told her all
the way home </s>
<s>  but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went for neither lydia nor <abvr> collins were once silent </s>
<s>  lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collins in describing the civility of <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing

chapter 


elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between <abvr>
wickham and herself </s>
<s>  jane listened with astonishment and concern </s>
<s>  she
knew not how to believe that <abvr> darcy could be so unworthy of <abvr>
bingleys regard </s>
<s>  and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham </s>
<s>  the
possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings </s>
<s>  and nothing remained therefore to be
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each

otherwise explained </s>
<s> 

they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way

misrepresented each to the other </s>

conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them

very true indeed </s>

business </s>
<s>  do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of

<s> 

laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion </s>
<s>  my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light

<s>  it is
impossible </s>
<s>  no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his
character could be capable of it </s>
<s>  can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 

i can much more easily believe <abvr> bingleys being imposed on than
that <abvr> wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night </s>
<s>  names facts everything mentioned without ceremony </s>
<s>  if it
be not so let <abvr> darcy contradict it </s>

looks </s>

it is difficult indeedit is distressing </s>
<s>  one does not know what to

<s> 

i beg your pardon </s>
<s>  one knows exactly what to think </s>

but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat <abvr> bingley

became public </s>

<s>  they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from <abvr> bennets civilities </s>
<s> 

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from <abvr> bingley himself instead of a
ceremonious card </s>
<s>  jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <abvr>
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in <abvr> darcys look
and behaviour </s>
<s>  the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
less on any single event or any particular person for though they
each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with <abvr> wickham
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball
was at any rate a ball </s>
<s>  and even mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it </s>
<s> 

while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements </s>
<s> 
society has claims on us all </s>
<s>  and i profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody </s>
<s> 

elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to <abvr> collins she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept <abvr> bingleys invitation and if
he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings
amusement </s>
<s>  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to
dance </s>
<s> 

i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball
of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people
can have any evil tendency </s>
<s>  and i am so far from objecting to dancing
myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially
a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause and not to any disrespect for her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in </s>
<s>  she had fully proposed being
engaged by <abvr> wickham for those very dances </s>
<s>  and to have <abvr> collins
instead </s>
<s>  her liveliness had never been worse timed </s>
<s>  there was no help
for it however </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickhams happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer and <abvr> collinss proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could </s>
<s>  she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more </s>
<s>  it now first
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors </s>
<s> 
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity </s>
<s>  and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to her </s>
<s>  elizabeth however did not choose
to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins might never make the offer and
till he did it was useless to quarrel about him </s>
<s> 

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the
younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton
once </s>
<s>  no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very
shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy </s>
<s>  even elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and
monday endurable to kitty and lydia </s>

chapter 


till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in
vain for <abvr> wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her </s>
<s>  the certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her </s>
<s>  she had dressed with more than
usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  but in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for <abvr> darcys
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers </s>
<s>  and though
this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who
told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before and was not yet returned </s>
<s>  adding with a significant smile
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here </s>
<s> 

this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make </s>
<s> 
attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham </s>
<s>  she
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away
with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to <abvr> bingley whose blind partiality provoked her </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour </s>
<s>  and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her
spirits </s>
<s>  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had
not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular
notice </s>
<s>  the first two dances however brought a return of distress </s>
<s> 
they were dances of mortification </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins awkward and solemn
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give </s>
<s>  the moment of her release from
him was ecstasy </s>
<s> 

she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked </s>
<s>  when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by <abvr> darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that
without knowing what she did she accepted him </s>
<s>  he walked away again
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind </s>
<s>  charlotte tried to console her </s>
<s> 

i dare say you will find him very agreeable </s>
<s> 

heaven forbid </s>
<s>  that would be the greatest misfortune of all </s>
<s>  to find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate </s>
<s>  do not wish me such an
evil </s>
<s> 

when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her
hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence </s>
<s>  elizabeth made no
answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <abvr> darcy and
reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding
it </s>
<s>  they stood for some time without speaking a word </s>
<s>  and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at
first was resolved not to break it </s>
<s>  till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made
some slight observation on the dance </s>
<s>  he replied and was again
silent </s>
<s>  after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time
with </s>
<s> it is your turn to say something now <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  i talked
about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples </s>
<s> 

he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  that reply will do for the present </s>
<s>  perhaps by and by i may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones </s>
<s>  but
now we may be silent </s>
<s> 

do you talk by rule then while you are dancing </s>
<s> 

sometimes </s>
<s>  one must speak a little you know </s>
<s>  it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together </s>
<s>  and yet for the advantage of
some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible </s>
<s> 

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine </s>
<s> 

both replied elizabeth archly </s>
<s>  for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds </s>
<s>  we are each of an unsocial
taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb </s>
<s> 

this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure
 said he </s>
<s>  how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say </s>
<s>  you
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly </s>
<s> 

i must not decide on my own performance </s>
<s> 

he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton </s>
<s>  she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just
been forming a new acquaintance </s>
<s> 

the effect was immediate </s>
<s>  a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself
for her own weakness could not go on </s>
<s>  at length darcy spoke and in a
constrained manner said <abvr> wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of
retaining them is less certain </s>
<s> 

he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life </s>
<s> 

darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject </s>
<s>  at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room </s>
<s>  but on perceiving <abvr>
darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner </s>
<s> 

i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir </s>
<s>  such very
superior dancing is not often seen </s>
<s>  it is evident that you belong to the
first circles </s>
<s>  allow me to say however that your fair partner does not
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated
especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at
her sister and bingley shall take place </s>
<s>  what congratulations will then
flow in </s>
<s>  i appeal to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> but let me not interrupt you sir </s>
<s>  you
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me </s>
<s> 

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy </s>
<s>  but sir
williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane who were dancing together </s>
<s>  recovering himself however shortly
he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of </s>
<s> 

i do not think we were speaking at all </s>
<s>  sir william could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves </s>
<s> 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we
are to talk of next i cannot imagine </s>
<s> 

what think you of books </s>
<s>  said he smiling </s>
<s> 

booksoh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  i am sure we never read the same or not with the same
feelings </s>
<s> 

i am sorry you think so </s>
<s>  but if that be the case there can at least be
no want of subject </s>
<s>  we may compare our different opinions </s>
<s> 

noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom </s>
<s>  my head is always full of
something else </s>
<s> 

the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it </s>
<s>  said he
with a look of doubt </s>
<s> 

yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say <abvr> darcy
that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was
unappeasable </s>
<s>  you are very cautious i suppose as to its being
created </s>
<s> 

i am said he with a firm voice </s>
<s> 

and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice </s>
<s> 

i hope not </s>
<s> 

it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion
to be secure of judging properly at first </s>
<s> 

may i ask to what these questions tend </s>
<s> 

merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring
to shake off her gravity </s>
<s>  i am trying to make it out </s>
<s> 

and what is your success </s>
<s> 

she shook her head </s>
<s>  i do not get on at all </s>
<s>  i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly </s>
<s> 

i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me </s>
<s>  and i could wish miss bennet that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either </s>
<s> 

but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another
opportunity </s>
<s> 

i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied </s>
<s> 
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence </s>
<s>  and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree
for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against
another </s>
<s> 

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her </s>
<s> 

so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham </s>
<s> 
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand
questions </s>
<s>  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among
his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late
mr </s>
<s>  darcys steward </s>
<s>  let me recommend you however as a friend not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions </s>
<s>  for as to <abvr> darcys
using him ill it is perfectly false </s>
<s>  for on the contrary he has
always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated
mr </s>
<s>  darcy in a most infamous manner </s>
<s>  i do not know the particulars but
i know very well that <abvr> darcy is not in the least to blame that he
cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way </s>
<s>  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it </s>
<s>  i pity you
miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt </s>
<s>  but really
considering his descent one could not expect much better </s>
<s> 

his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said
elizabeth angrily </s>
<s>  for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of <abvr> darcys steward and of that i can
assure you he informed me himself </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer </s>
<s> 
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant </s>
<s> 

insolent girl </s>
<s>  said elizabeth to herself </s>
<s>  you are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this </s>
<s>  i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <abvr>
darcy </s>
<s>  she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley </s>
<s>  jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening </s>
<s> 
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for
wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way
before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness </s>
<s> 

i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her
sisters what you have learnt about <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person </s>
<s>  in which case
you may be sure of my pardon </s>
<s> 

no replied jane i have not forgotten him </s>
<s>  but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley does not know the whole of
his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  but he will vouch for the good conduct
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that
mr </s>
<s>  wickham has deserved much less attention from <abvr> darcy than he has
received </s>
<s>  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters
mr </s>
<s>  wickham is by no means a respectable young man </s>
<s>  i am afraid he has
been very imprudent and has deserved to lose <abvr> darcys regard </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley does not know <abvr> wickham himself </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton </s>
<s> 

this account then is what he has received from <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  i am
satisfied </s>
<s>  but what does he say of the living </s>
<s> 

he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard
them from <abvr> darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to
him conditionally only </s>
<s> 

i have not a doubt of <abvr> bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly </s>
<s> 
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say </s>
<s>  but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as i did before </s>
<s> 

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment </s>
<s>  elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of <abvr>
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it </s>
<s>  on their being joined by <abvr> bingley himself elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas </s>
<s>  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied before <abvr> collins came up to them
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery </s>
<s> 

i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness </s>
<s>  i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady
catherine </s>
<s>  how wonderfully these sort of things occur </s>
<s>  who would have
thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly </s>
<s>  i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to
do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before </s>
<s>  my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology </s>
<s> 

you are not going to introduce yourself to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

indeed i am </s>
<s>  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier </s>
<s> 
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew </s>
<s>  it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight </s>
<s> 

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him
that <abvr> darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt </s>
<s>  that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side </s>
<s>  and that if it were it must belong to <abvr> darcy the superior in
consequence to begin the acquaintance </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she
ceased speaking replied thus </s>
<s> 

my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding </s>
<s>  but permit me to say that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity
and those which regulate the clergy </s>
<s>  for give me leave to observe that
i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained </s>
<s>  you must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to
perform what i look on as a point of duty </s>
<s>  pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself </s>
<s>  and with a low bow he left her to attack <abvr>
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident </s>
<s>  her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the
words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh </s>
<s>  it vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder and when at last <abvr> collins allowed him time
to speak replied with an air of distant civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins however
was not discouraged from speaking again and <abvr> darcys contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins then returned to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my
reception </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy seemed much pleased with the attention </s>
<s>  he answered
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily </s>
<s>  it was really a very
handsome thought </s>
<s>  upon the whole i am much pleased with him </s>
<s> 

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane </s>
<s>  she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow </s>
<s>  and she felt capable under such circumstances of
endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters </s>
<s>  her mothers thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to
venture near her lest she might hear too much </s>
<s>  when they sat down to
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other </s>
<s>  and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely
openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon
be married to <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  it was an animating subject and <abvr> bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match </s>
<s>  his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but
three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation </s>
<s>  and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do </s>
<s>  it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men </s>
<s>  and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked </s>
<s>  it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on
such occasions it is the etiquette </s>
<s>  but no one was less likely than <abvr>
bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life </s>
<s>  she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it </s>
<s> 

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers
words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper </s>
<s>  for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by <abvr> darcy who sat opposite to them </s>
<s>  her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical </s>
<s> 

what is <abvr> darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him </s>
<s>  i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing he may not like to hear </s>
<s> 

for heavens sake madam speak lower </s>
<s>  what advantage can it be for you
to offend <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing </s>
<s> 

nothing that she could say however had any influence </s>
<s>  her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone </s>
<s>  elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation </s>
<s>  she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at <abvr> darcy though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded </s>
<s>  for though he was not always looking at her mother she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her </s>
<s>  the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity </s>
<s> 

at length however <abvr> bennet had no more to say </s>
<s>  and lady lucas who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken </s>
<s>  elizabeth now began to revive </s>
<s>  but not long was the interval of
tranquillity </s>
<s>  for when supper was over singing was talked of and
she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty
preparing to oblige the company </s>
<s>  by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance
but in vain </s>
<s>  mary would not understand them </s>
<s>  such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song </s>
<s>  elizabeths
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close </s>
<s>  for mary on receiving amongst the thanks
of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another </s>
<s> 
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display </s>
<s>  her voice was
weak and her manner affected </s>
<s>  elizabeth was in agonies </s>
<s>  she looked at
jane to see how she bore it </s>
<s>  but jane was very composedly talking to
bingley </s>
<s>  she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs
of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however
imperturbably grave </s>
<s>  she looked at her father to entreat his
interference lest mary should be singing all night </s>
<s>  he took the hint
and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do
extremely well child </s>
<s>  you have delighted us long enough </s>
<s>  let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit </s>
<s> 

mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid
her anxiety had done no good </s>
<s>  others of the party were now applied to </s>
<s> 

if i said <abvr> collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i
should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an
air </s>
<s>  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman </s>
<s>  i do not mean however
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to </s>
<s>  the
rector of a parish has much to do </s>
<s>  in the first place he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron </s>
<s>  he must write his own sermons </s>
<s>  and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible </s>
<s>  and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment </s>
<s>  i cannot acquit
him of that duty </s>
<s>  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family </s>
<s>  and with a bow to <abvr> darcy he concluded his speech which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room </s>
<s>  many staredmany
smiled </s>
<s>  but no one looked more amused than <abvr> bennet himself while his
wife seriously commended <abvr> collins for having spoken so sensibly
and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably
clever good kind of young man </s>
<s> 

to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success </s>
<s>  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed </s>
<s>  that his two sisters and <abvr> darcy however should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable </s>
<s> 

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement </s>
<s>  she was teased by
mr </s>
<s>  collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her
power to dance with others </s>
<s>  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room </s>
<s> 
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it </s>
<s> 
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening </s>
<s>  there was no arguing upon such a project </s>
<s>  she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and
goodnaturedly engaged <abvr> collinss conversation to herself </s>
<s> 

she was at least free from the offense of <abvr> darcys further notice </s>
<s> 
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite
disengaged he never came near enough to speak </s>
<s>  she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to <abvr> wickham and rejoiced in
it </s>
<s> 

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by
a manoeuvre of <abvr> bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family </s>
<s>  <abvr> hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves </s>
<s>  they repulsed
every attempt of <abvr> bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of <abvr> collins who was complimenting <abvr> bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests </s>
<s>  darcy said
nothing at all </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest and talked only to each other </s>
<s>  elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either <abvr> hurst or miss bingley </s>
<s>  and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord
how tired i am </s>
<s>  accompanied by a violent yawn </s>
<s> 

when at length they arose to take leave <abvr> bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and
addressed herself especially to <abvr> bingley to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without
the ceremony of a formal invitation </s>
<s>  bingley was all grateful pleasure
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months </s>
<s>  of having another daughter married to <abvr> collins she thought
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure </s>
<s> 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children </s>
<s>  and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each
was eclipsed by <abvr> bingley and netherfield </s>

chapter 


the next day opened a new scene at longbourn </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins made his
declaration in form </s>
<s>  having resolved to do it without loss of time as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business </s>
<s>  on
finding <abvr> bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together
soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words </s>
<s> 

may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning </s>
<s> 

before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise <abvr>
bennet answered instantly oh dear </s>
<s> yescertainly </s>
<s>  i am sure lizzy
will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection </s>
<s>  come kitty i
want you up stairs </s>
<s>  and gathering her work together she was hastening
away when elizabeth called out </s>
<s> 

dear madam do not go </s>
<s>  i beg you will not go </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins must excuse
me </s>
<s>  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear </s>
<s>  i am
going away myself </s>
<s> 

no no nonsense lizzy </s>
<s>  i desire you to stay where you are </s>
<s>  and upon
elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to
escape she added </s>
<s>  lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing <abvr>
collins </s>
<s> 

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to
conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as
they were gone <abvr> collins began </s>
<s> 

believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections </s>
<s>  you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness </s>
<s>  but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mothers permission for this address </s>
<s>  you can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble </s>
<s>  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken </s>
<s>  almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of
my future life </s>
<s>  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife as i certainly did </s>
<s> 

the idea of <abvr> collins with all his solemn composure being run away
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further
and he continued </s>
<s> 

my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish </s>
<s>  secondly that i am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness </s>
<s>  and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought
to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness </s>
<s>  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked
too </s>
<s>  on this subject </s>
<s>  and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while <abvr> jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said �mr </s>
<s>  collins you
must marry </s>
<s>  a clergyman like you must marry </s>
<s>  choose properly choose
a gentlewoman for my sake </s>
<s>  and for your own let her be an active
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small
income go a good way </s>
<s>  this is my advice </s>
<s>  find such a woman as soon as
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her </s>
<s>  allow me by the
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice
and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer </s>
<s>  you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe </s>
<s>  and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite </s>
<s>  thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony </s>
<s>  it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i
can assure you there are many amiable young women </s>
<s>  but the fact is that
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not
be for several years </s>
<s>  this has been my motive my fair cousin and
i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem </s>
<s>  and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection </s>
<s>  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with </s>
<s>  and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to </s>
<s>  on that head
therefore i shall be uniformly silent </s>
<s>  and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married </s>
<s> 

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now </s>
<s> 

you are too hasty sir she cried </s>
<s>  you forget that i have made no
answer </s>
<s>  let me do it without further loss of time </s>
<s>  accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me </s>
<s>  i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them </s>
<s> 

i am not now to learn replied <abvr> collins with a formal wave of the
hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their
favour </s>
<s>  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time </s>
<s>  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long </s>
<s> 

upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration </s>
<s>  i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time </s>
<s>  i am perfectly serious in my refusal </s>
<s>  you could not make me
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
could make you so </s>
<s>  nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation </s>
<s> 

were it certain that lady catherine would think so said <abvr> collins
very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you </s>
<s>  and you may be certain when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty economy and other amiable qualification </s>
<s> 

indeed <abvr> collins all praise of me will be unnecessary </s>
<s>  you
must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment
of believing what i say </s>
<s>  i wish you very happy and very rich and by
refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise </s>
<s> 
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach </s>
<s>  this matter may
be considered therefore as finally settled </s>
<s>  and rising as she
thus spoke she would have quitted the room had <abvr> collins not thus
addressed her </s>
<s> 

when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me </s>
<s>  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character </s>
<s> 

really <abvr> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me
exceedingly </s>
<s>  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one </s>
<s> 

you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course </s>
<s>  my reasons for
believing it are briefly these </s>
<s>  it does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable </s>
<s>  my situation in life my connections
with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are
circumstances highly in my favour </s>
<s>  and you should take it into further
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you </s>
<s>  your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications </s>
<s>  as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me
i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females </s>
<s> 

i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man </s>
<s>  i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere </s>
<s>  i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but
to accept them is absolutely impossible </s>
<s>  my feelings in every respect
forbid it </s>
<s>  can i speak plainer </s>
<s>  do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking
the truth from her heart </s>
<s> 

you are uniformly charming </s>
<s>  cried he with an air of awkward
gallantry </s>
<s>  and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable </s>
<s> 

to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make
no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew </s>
<s>  determined if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character </s>
<s> 

this information however startled <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it
and could not help saying so </s>
<s> 

but depend upon it <abvr> collins she added that lizzy shall be
brought to reason </s>
<s>  i will speak to her about it directly </s>
<s>  she is a very
headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will
make her know it </s>
<s> 

pardon me for interrupting you madam cried <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  but if
she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state </s>
<s>  if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity </s>
<s> 

sir you quite misunderstand me said <abvr> bennet alarmed </s>
<s>  lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these </s>
<s>  in everything else she is as
goodnatured a girl as ever lived </s>
<s>  i will go directly to <abvr> bennet and
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure </s>
<s> 

she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her
husband called out as she entered the library oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet you
are wanted immediately </s>
<s>  we are all in an uproar </s>
<s>  you must come and make
lizzy marry <abvr> collins for she vows she will not have him and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication </s>
<s> 

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had
finished her speech </s>
<s>  of what are you talking </s>
<s> 

of <abvr> collins and lizzy </s>
<s>  lizzy declares she will not have <abvr> collins
and <abvr> collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy </s>
<s> 

and what am i to do on the occasion </s>
<s>  it seems an hopeless business </s>
<s> 

speak to lizzy about it yourself </s>
<s>  tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him </s>
<s> 

let her be called down </s>
<s>  she shall hear my opinion </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library </s>
<s> 

come here child cried her father as she appeared </s>
<s>  i have sent for
you on an affair of importance </s>
<s>  i understand that <abvr> collins has made
you an offer of marriage </s>
<s>  is it true </s>
<s>  elizabeth replied that it was </s>
<s> 
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused </s>
<s> 

i have sir </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  we now come to the point </s>
<s>  your mother insists upon your
accepting it </s>
<s>  is it not so <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

yes or i will never see her again </s>
<s> 

an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth </s>
<s>  from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents </s>
<s>  your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry <abvr> collins and i will never see you again
if you do </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning
but <abvr> bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished was excessively disappointed </s>
<s> 

what do you mean <abvr> bennet in talking this way </s>
<s>  you promised me to
insist upon her marrying him </s>
<s> 

my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request </s>
<s> 
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion </s>
<s>  and secondly of my room </s>
<s>  i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be </s>
<s> 

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet give up the point </s>
<s>  she talked to elizabeth again and again </s>
<s> 
coaxed and threatened her by turns </s>
<s>  she endeavoured to secure jane
in her interest </s>
<s>  but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering </s>
<s>  and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks </s>
<s>  though her manner
varied however her determination never did </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed </s>
<s> 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him </s>
<s>  and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other
way </s>
<s>  his regard for her was quite imaginary </s>
<s>  and the possibility of her
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret </s>
<s> 

while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them </s>
<s>  she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to
her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such
fun here </s>
<s>  what do you think has happened this morning </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins has
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him </s>
<s> 

charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty
who came to tell the same news </s>
<s>  and no sooner had they entered the
breakfastroom where <abvr> bennet was alone than she likewise began on
the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family </s>
<s>  pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone
for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me </s>
<s>  i am cruelly used
nobody feels for my poor nerves </s>
<s> 

charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth </s>
<s> 

aye there she comes continued <abvr> bennet looking as unconcerned
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided
she can have her own way </s>
<s>  but i tell you miss lizzyif you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead </s>
<s>  i shall not be able to keep
youand so i warn you </s>
<s>  i have done with you from this very day </s>
<s>  i told
you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again
and you will find me as good as my word </s>
<s>  i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children </s>
<s>  not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking
to anybody </s>
<s>  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking </s>
<s>  nobody can tell what i suffer </s>
<s>  but it
is always so </s>
<s>  those who do not complain are never pitied </s>
<s> 

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation </s>
<s>  she talked on therefore without interruption from any of
them till they were joined by <abvr> collins who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to
the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold
your tongues and let me and <abvr> collins have a little conversation
together </s>
<s> 

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could </s>
<s>  and charlotte
detained first by the civility of <abvr> collins whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little
curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear </s>
<s>  in a doleful voice <abvr> bennet began the projected
conversation </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 

my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point </s>
<s> 
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter </s>
<s>  resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all </s>
<s>  the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment </s>
<s> 
and i trust i am resigned </s>
<s>  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand </s>
<s> 
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation </s>
<s>  you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughters favour without having paid yourself and <abvr> bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf </s>
<s>  my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own </s>
<s>  but we are all
liable to error </s>
<s>  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair </s>
<s> 
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise </s>

chapter 


the discussion of <abvr> collinss offer was now nearly at an end and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother </s>
<s>  as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly
expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence </s>
<s>  he scarcely ever spoke
to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and
especially to her friend </s>
<s> 

the morrow produced no abatement of <abvr> bennets illhumour or ill
health </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was also in the same state of angry pride </s>
<s>  elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it </s>
<s>  he was always to have gone on
saturday and to saturday he meant to stay </s>
<s> 

after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if <abvr> wickham
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball </s>
<s> 
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was
well talked over </s>
<s>  to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed </s>
<s> 

i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet
mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  that to be in the same room the same party with him for so
many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself </s>
<s> 

she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to
her </s>
<s>  his accompanying them was a double advantage </s>
<s>  she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother </s>
<s> 

soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet </s>
<s>  it came
from netherfield </s>
<s>  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little
hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages </s>
<s>  jane recollected
herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation </s>
<s>  but elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham </s>
<s>  and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane
invited her to follow her up stairs </s>
<s>  when they had gained their own room
jane taking out the letter said </s>
<s> 

this is from caroline bingley </s>
<s>  what it contains has surprised me a good
deal </s>
<s>  the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on
their way to townand without any intention of coming back again </s>
<s>  you
shall hear what she says </s>
<s> 

she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly
and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where <abvr> hurst had a
house </s>
<s>  the next was in these words </s>
<s>  i do not pretend to regret anything
i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend </s>
<s> 
but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence </s>
<s>  i depend on you for that </s>
<s>  to these highflown
expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust </s>
<s> 
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw
nothing in it really to lament </s>
<s>  it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent <abvr> bingleys being there </s>
<s>  and as
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to
regard it in the enjoyment of his </s>
<s> 

it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country </s>
<s>  but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters </s>
<s>  <abvr> bingley will not be detained in london by
them </s>

caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter </s>
<s>  i will read it to you </s>
<s> 

when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days </s>
<s>  but as we
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have
determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel </s>
<s>  many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter </s>
<s>  i wish that i could hear that you my
dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of
that i despair </s>
<s>  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you </s>
<s> 

it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this
winter </s>
<s> 

it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should </s>
<s> 

why will you think so </s>
<s>  it must be his own doing </s>
<s>  he is his own
master </s>
<s>  but you do not know all </s>
<s>  i will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me </s>
<s>  i will have no reserves from you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy is impatient to see his sister </s>
<s>  and to confess the truth
we are scarcely less eager to meet her again </s>
<s>  i really do not think
georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments </s>
<s> 
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister </s>
<s>  i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject </s>
<s>  but i will not leave the
country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable </s>
<s>  my brother admires her greatly already </s>
<s>  he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing </s>
<s> 
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own </s>
<s>  and a sisters
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most
capable of engaging any womans heart </s>
<s>  with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many </s>
<s> 

what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy </s>
<s>  said jane as she
finished it </s>
<s>  is it not clear enough </s>
<s>  does it not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister </s>
<s>  that she is
perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference </s>
<s>  and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly </s>
<s>  to
put me on my guard </s>
<s>  can there be any other opinion on the subject </s>
<s> 

yes there can </s>
<s>  for mine is totally different </s>
<s>  will you hear it </s>
<s> 

most willingly </s>
<s> 

you shall have it in a few words </s>
<s>  miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy </s>
<s>  she follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you </s>
<s> 

jane shook her head </s>
<s> 

indeed jane you ought to believe me </s>
<s>  no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection </s>
<s>  miss bingley i am sure cannot </s>
<s>  she
is not such a simpleton </s>
<s>  could she have seen half as much love in <abvr>
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes </s>
<s>  but the
case is this </s>
<s>  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them </s>
<s>  and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion
that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble
in achieving a second </s>
<s>  in which there is certainly some ingenuity and
i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way </s>
<s>  but
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead
of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend </s>
<s> 

if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your
representation of all this might make me quite easy </s>
<s>  but i know the
foundation is unjust </s>
<s>  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone </s>
<s>  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself </s>
<s> 

that is right </s>
<s>  you could not have started a more happy idea since you
will not take comfort in mine </s>
<s>  believe her to be deceived by all means </s>
<s> 
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer </s>
<s> 

but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere </s>
<s> 

you must decide for yourself said elizabeth </s>
<s>  and if upon mature
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by
all means to refuse him </s>
<s> 

how can you talk so </s>
<s>  said jane faintly smiling </s>
<s>  you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could
not hesitate </s>
<s> 

i did not think you would </s>
<s>  and that being the case i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion </s>
<s> 

but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be
required </s>
<s>  a thousand things may arise in six months </s>
<s> 

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt </s>
<s>  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone </s>
<s> 

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect </s>
<s> 
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart </s>
<s> 

they agreed that <abvr> bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct </s>
<s> 
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together </s>
<s>  after
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that <abvr>
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two
full courses </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her </s>
<s>  it keeps him in good
humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express </s>
<s> 
 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time </s>
<s>  this was
very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of </s>
<s>  its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of <abvr> collinss addresses by engaging them towards
herself </s>
<s>  such was miss lucass scheme </s>
<s>  and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very
soon </s>
<s>  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet </s>
<s>  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins
from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to
conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise </s>
<s>  for though feeling almost
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday </s>
<s> 
his reception however was of the most flattering kind </s>
<s>  miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane </s>
<s>  but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there </s>
<s> 

in as short a time as <abvr> collinss long speeches would allow
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both </s>
<s>  and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men </s>
<s>  and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness </s>
<s>  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance </s>
<s>  and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that
establishment were gained </s>
<s> 

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent </s>
<s> 
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity </s>
<s>  <abvr> collinss present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom
they could give little fortune </s>
<s>  and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair </s>
<s>  lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer
mr </s>
<s>  bennet was likely to live </s>
<s>  and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion that whenever <abvr> collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s>  the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion </s>
<s>  the younger girls formed hopes
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done </s>
<s>  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes
dying an old maid </s>
<s>  charlotte herself was tolerably composed </s>
<s>  she had
gained her point and had time to consider of it </s>
<s>  her reflections were
in general satisfactory </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins to be sure was neither sensible
nor agreeable </s>
<s>  his society was irksome and his attachment to her must
be imaginary </s>
<s>  but still he would be her husband </s>
<s>  without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object </s>
<s>  it was
the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune
and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest
preservative from want </s>
<s>  this preservative she had now obtained </s>
<s>  and at
the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all
the good luck of it </s>
<s>  the least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person </s>
<s>  elizabeth would wonder
and probably would blame her </s>
<s>  and though her resolution was not to be
shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation </s>
<s>  she resolved
to give her the information herself and therefore charged <abvr> collins
when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family </s>
<s>  a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty </s>
<s>  for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was
at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love </s>
<s> 

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet with great politeness and cordiality
said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them </s>
<s> 

my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly
gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive </s>
<s>  and
you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible </s>
<s> 

they were all astonished </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return immediately said </s>
<s> 

but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my
good sir </s>
<s>  you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness </s>
<s> 

my dear sir replied <abvr> collins i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyships concurrence </s>
<s> 

you cannot be too much upon your guard </s>
<s>  risk anything rather than her
displeasure </s>
<s>  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home
and be satisfied that we shall take no offence </s>
<s> 

believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention </s>
<s>  and depend upon it you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  as for my fair cousins though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my
cousin elizabeth </s>
<s> 

with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew </s>
<s>  all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him </s>
<s> 
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others </s>
<s>  there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very
agreeable companion </s>
<s>  but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away </s>
<s>  miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before </s>
<s> 

the possibility of <abvr> collinss fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two </s>
<s>  but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and
she could not help crying out </s>
<s> 

engaged to <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  my dear charlotteimpossible </s>
<s> 

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach </s>
<s>  though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained
her composure and calmly replied </s>
<s> 

why should you be surprised my dear eliza </s>
<s>  do you think it incredible
that <abvr> collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you </s>
<s> 

but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort
for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness </s>
<s> 

i see what you are feeling replied charlotte </s>
<s>  you must be surprised
very much surprisedso lately as <abvr> collins was wishing to marry
you </s>
<s>  but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done </s>
<s>  i am not romantic you know </s>
<s>  i never
was </s>
<s>  i ask only a comfortable home </s>
<s>  and considering <abvr> collinss
character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state </s>
<s> 

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly </s>
<s>  and after an awkward pause
they returned to the rest of the family </s>
<s>  charlotte did not stay much
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard </s>
<s> 
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match </s>
<s>  the strangeness of <abvr> collinss making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted </s>
<s>  she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible
that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage </s>
<s>  charlotte the wife of <abvr> collins was a
most humiliating picture </s>
<s>  and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what
she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family </s>
<s>  with many compliments to them
and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but
incredulous </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet with more perseverance than politeness
protested he must be entirely mistaken </s>
<s>  and lydia always unguarded and
often uncivil boisterously exclaimed </s>
<s> 

good lord </s>
<s>  sir william how can you tell such a story </s>
<s>  do not you know
that <abvr> collins wants to marry lizzy </s>
<s> 

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment </s>
<s>  but sir williams good breeding carried
him through it all </s>
<s>  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself </s>
<s>  and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she
was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character
of <abvr> collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained </s>
<s>  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent </s>
<s>  in the first place she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter </s>
<s>  secondly she was very sure that <abvr> collins
had been taken in </s>
<s>  thirdly she trusted that they would never be
happy together </s>
<s>  and fourthly that the match might be broken off </s>
<s>  two
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole </s>
<s>  one that
elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief </s>
<s>  and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all </s>
<s>  and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day </s>
<s>  nothing could
console and nothing could appease her </s>
<s>  nor did that day wear out her
resentment </s>
<s>  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort </s>
<s>  for
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and
more foolish than his daughter </s>
<s> 

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match </s>
<s>  but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness </s>
<s> 
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable </s>
<s>  kitty
and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for <abvr> collins was only a
clergyman </s>
<s>  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton </s>
<s> 

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on <abvr> bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married </s>
<s>  and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was
though <abvr> bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away </s>
<s> 

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject </s>
<s>  and elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again </s>
<s>  her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious
as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return </s>
<s> 

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again </s>
<s>  the promised
letter of thanks from <abvr> collins arrived on tuesday addressed to
their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted </s>
<s>  after discharging
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight </s>
<s>  for lady catherine
he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband </s>
<s>  it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge </s>
<s>  it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome </s>
<s>  she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable </s>
<s>  such were the gentle murmurs of <abvr> bennet and
they gave way only to the greater distress of <abvr> bingleys continued
absence </s>
<s> 

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject </s>
<s>  day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter </s>
<s>  a report which highly incensed <abvr>
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood </s>
<s> 

even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away </s>
<s>  unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its
frequently occurring </s>
<s>  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for
the strength of his attachment </s>
<s> 

as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject
was never alluded to </s>
<s>  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her
impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used </s>
<s>  it needed
all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction </s>
<s>  he was too happy however to need much attention </s>
<s> 
and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them
from a great deal of his company </s>
<s>  the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet was really in a most pitiable state </s>
<s>  the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of </s>
<s>  the sight
of miss lucas was odious to her </s>
<s>  as her successor in that house she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence </s>
<s>  whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession </s>
<s>  and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to <abvr> collins was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as <abvr> bennet were dead </s>
<s>  she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband </s>
<s> 

indeed <abvr> bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to
make way for her and live to see her take her place in it </s>
<s> 

my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts </s>
<s>  let us hope for
better things </s>
<s>  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor </s>
<s> 

this was not very consoling to <abvr> bennet and therefore instead of
making any answer she went on as before </s>
<s> 

i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate </s>
<s>  if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it </s>
<s> 

what should not you mind </s>
<s> 

i should not mind anything at all </s>
<s> 

let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility </s>
<s> 

i never can be thankful <abvr> bennet for anything about the entail </s>
<s>  how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own
daughters i cannot understand </s>
<s>  and all for the sake of <abvr> collins too </s>
<s> 
why should he have it more than anybody else </s>
<s> 

i leave it to yourself to determine said <abvr> bennet </s>

chapter 


miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt </s>
<s>  the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country </s>
<s> 

hope was over entirely over </s>
<s>  and when jane could attend to the rest
of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the
writer that could give her any comfort </s>
<s>  miss darcys praise occupied
the chief of it </s>
<s>  her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter </s>

inmate of <abvr> darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture </s>
<s> 

elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this
heard it in silent indignation </s>
<s>  her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others </s>
<s>  to carolines
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit </s>
<s>  that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she
had ever done </s>
<s>  and much as she had always been disposed to like him she
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination </s>
<s>  had his own happiness however
been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as
she thought he must be sensible himself </s>
<s>  it was a subject in short
on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing </s>
<s>  she
could think of nothing else </s>
<s>  and yet whether bingleys regard had really
died away or were suppressed by his friends interference </s>
<s>  whether
he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his
observation </s>
<s>  whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained
the same her peace equally wounded </s>
<s> 

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  but at last on <abvr> bennets leaving them together after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could
not help saying </s>
<s> 

oh that my dear mother had more command over herself </s>
<s>  she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him </s>
<s>  but
i will not repine </s>
<s>  it cannot last long </s>

and disinterestedness are really angelic </s>
<s>  i do not know what to say
to you </s>
<s>  i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you
deserve </s>
<s> 

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back
the praise on her sisters warm affection </s>
<s> 

nay said elizabeth this is not fair </s>
<s>  you wish to think all the
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody </s>
<s>  i only want
to think you perfect and you set yourself against it </s>
<s>  do not
be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal goodwill </s>
<s>  you need not </s>
<s>  there are few people
whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well </s>
<s>  the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it </s>
<s>  and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense </s>
<s>  i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention </s>
<s>  the
other is charlottes marriage </s>
<s>  it is unaccountable </s>
<s>  in every view it is
unaccountable </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these </s>
<s>  they will
ruin your happiness </s>
<s>  you do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper </s>
<s>  consider <abvr> collinss respectability and
charlottes steady prudent character </s>
<s>  remember that she is one of a
large family </s>
<s>  that as to fortune it is a most eligible match </s>
<s>  and be
ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin </s>
<s> 

to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this </s>
<s>  for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart </s>
<s>  my dear jane <abvr> collins is a
conceited pompous narrowminded silly man </s>
<s>  you know he is as well as
i do </s>
<s>  and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking </s>
<s>  you shall not defend her though
it is charlotte lucas </s>
<s>  you shall not for the sake of one individual
change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of
danger security for happiness </s>
<s> 

i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied
jane </s>
<s>  and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together </s>
<s>  but enough of this </s>
<s>  you alluded to something else </s>
<s>  you
mentioned two instances </s>
<s>  i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and
saying your opinion of him is sunk </s>
<s>  we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured </s>
<s>  we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect </s>
<s>  it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us </s>
<s>  women fancy admiration means more than
it does </s>
<s> 

and men take care that they should </s>
<s> 

if it is designedly done they cannot be justified </s>
<s>  but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine </s>
<s> 

i am far from attributing any part of <abvr> bingleys conduct to design
 said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but without scheming to do wrong or to make others
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery </s>
<s>  thoughtlessness
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution
will do the business </s>
<s> 

and do you impute it to either of those </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  to the last </s>
<s>  but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem </s>
<s>  stop me whilst you can </s>
<s> 

you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him </s>
<s> 

yes in conjunction with his friend </s>
<s> 

i cannot believe it </s>
<s>  why should they try to influence him </s>
<s>  they can
only wish his happiness </s>
<s>  and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it </s>
<s> 

your first position is false </s>
<s>  they may wish many things besides his
happiness </s>
<s>  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence </s>
<s>  they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great
connections and pride </s>
<s> 

beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane </s>
<s> 
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing </s>
<s>  they have
known her much longer than they have known me </s>
<s>  no wonder if they love
her better </s>
<s>  but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brothers </s>
<s>  what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very
objectionable </s>
<s>  if they believed him attached to me they would not try
to part us </s>
<s>  if he were so they could not succeed </s>
<s>  by supposing such an
affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most
unhappy </s>
<s>  do not distress me by the idea </s>
<s>  i am not ashamed of having been
mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what
i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters </s>
<s>  let me take it in
the best light in the light in which it may be understood </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish </s>
<s>  and from this time <abvr> bingleys
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity </s>
<s>  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her
no more </s>
<s>  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time she had the same story to repeat every day </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennets best
comfort was that <abvr> bingley must be down again in the summer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet treated the matter differently </s>
<s>  so lizzy said he one day
your sister is crossed in love i find </s>
<s>  i congratulate her </s>
<s>  next to
being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then </s>
<s> 
it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions </s>
<s>  when is your turn to come </s>
<s>  you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane </s>
<s>  now is your time </s>
<s>  here are officers enough in
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country </s>
<s>  let wickham
be your man </s>
<s>  he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably </s>
<s> 

thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me </s>
<s>  we must not
all expect janes good fortune </s>
<s> 

true said <abvr> bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family </s>
<s>  they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve </s>
<s>  the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard his claims on <abvr> darcy and all that he had suffered from him
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed </s>
<s>  and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked <abvr> darcy before they
had known anything of the matter </s>
<s> 

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society
of hertfordshire </s>
<s>  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else
mr </s>
<s>  darcy was condemned as the worst of men </s>

chapter 


after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity
mr </s>
<s>  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday </s>
<s>  the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride </s>
<s>  as he had reason
to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men </s>
<s>  he took leave of his
relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before </s>
<s>  wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another
letter of thanks </s>
<s> 

on the following monday <abvr> bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas
at longbourn </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly
superior to his sister as well by nature as education </s>
<s>  the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so
wellbred and agreeable </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner who was several years younger
than <abvr> bennet and <abvr> phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant
woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces </s>
<s>  between the
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard </s>
<s> 
they had frequently been staying with her in town </s>
<s> 

the first part of <abvr> gardiners business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions </s>
<s>  when this was
done she had a less active part to play </s>
<s>  it became her turn to listen </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of </s>
<s>  they
had all been very illused since she last saw her sister </s>
<s>  two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was
nothing in it </s>
<s> 

i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got <abvr>
bingley if she could </s>
<s>  but lizzy </s>
<s>  oh sister </s>
<s>  it is very hard to think
that she might have been <abvr> collinss wife by this time had it not
been for her own perverseness </s>
<s>  he made her an offer in this very room
and she refused him </s>
<s>  the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever </s>
<s>  the lucases are very artful people indeed
sister </s>
<s>  they are all for what they can get </s>
<s>  i am sorry to say it of
them but so it is </s>
<s>  it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted
so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else </s>
<s>  however your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before
in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her
sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation </s>
<s> 

when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject </s>
<s>  it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she </s>
<s>  i am
sorry it went off </s>
<s>  but these things happen so often </s>
<s>  a young man such
as you describe <abvr> bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets
her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent </s>
<s> 

an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not
do for us </s>
<s>  we do not suffer by accident </s>
<s>  it does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before </s>
<s> 

but that expression of �violently in love is so hackneyed so
doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea </s>
<s>  it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance
as to a real strong attachment </s>
<s>  pray how violent was <abvr> bingleys
love </s>
<s> 

i never saw a more promising inclination </s>
<s>  he was growing quite
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her </s>
<s>  every time
they met it was more decided and remarkable </s>
<s>  at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance </s>
<s>  and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer </s>
<s>  could there be
finer symptoms </s>
<s>  is not general incivility the very essence of love </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt </s>
<s>  poor
jane </s>
<s>  i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get
over it immediately </s>
<s>  it had better have happened to you lizzy </s>
<s>  you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner </s>
<s>  but do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us </s>
<s>  change of scene might be
of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded
of her sisters ready acquiescence </s>
<s> 

i hope added <abvr> gardiner that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her </s>
<s>  we live in so different a part of
town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go
out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all
unless he really comes to see her </s>
<s> 

and that is quite impossible </s>
<s>  for he is now in the custody of his
friend and <abvr> darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such
a part of london </s>
<s>  my dear aunt how could you think of it </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy may
perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he
would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities were he once to enter it </s>
<s>  and depend upon it <abvr> bingley
never stirs without him </s>
<s> 

so much the better </s>
<s>  i hope they will not meet at all </s>
<s>  but does not jane
correspond with his sister </s>
<s>  she will not be able to help calling </s>
<s> 

she will drop the acquaintance entirely </s>
<s> 

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless </s>
<s>  it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes
attractions </s>
<s> 

miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure </s>
<s>  and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of
seeing him </s>
<s> 

the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn </s>
<s>  and what with the phillipses
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its
engagement </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner </s>
<s>  when the engagement was for home some of the officers always
made part of itof which officers <abvr> wickham was sure to be one </s>
<s>  and
on these occasions <abvr> gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths
warm commendation narrowly observed them both </s>
<s>  without supposing them
from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy </s>
<s>  and
she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure
unconnected with his general powers </s>
<s>  about ten or a dozen years ago
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of derbyshire to which he belonged </s>
<s>  they had therefore many
acquaintances in common </s>
<s>  and though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late <abvr> darcy by
character perfectly well </s>
<s>  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse </s>
<s>  in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute
description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both
him and herself </s>
<s>  on being made acquainted with the present <abvr> darcys
treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard <abvr> fitzwilliam
darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mrs </s>
<s>  gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone </s>
<s>  after
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on </s>
<s> 

you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it </s>
<s>  and therefore i am not afraid of speaking
openly </s>
<s>  seriously i would have you be on your guard </s>
<s>  do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent </s>
<s>  i have nothing to say against
him </s>
<s>  he is a most interesting young man </s>
<s>  and if he had the fortune he
ought to have i should think you could not do better </s>
<s>  but as it is you
must not let your fancy run away with you </s>
<s>  you have sense and we all
expect you to use it </s>
<s>  your father would depend on your resolution and
good conduct i am sure </s>
<s>  you must not disappoint your father </s>
<s> 

my dear aunt this is being serious indeed </s>
<s> 

yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise </s>
<s> 

well then you need not be under any alarm </s>
<s>  i will take care of
myself and of <abvr> wickham too </s>
<s>  he shall not be in love with me if i
can prevent it </s>
<s> 

elizabeth you are not serious now </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon i will try again </s>
<s>  at present i am not in love with
mr </s>
<s>  wickham </s>
<s>  no i certainly am not </s>
<s>  but he is beyond all comparison
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to
mei believe it will be better that he should not </s>
<s>  i see the imprudence
of it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  that abominable <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  my fathers opinion of me does
me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it </s>
<s>  my
father however is partial to <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  in short my dear aunt i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy </s>
<s>  but
since we see every day that where there is affection young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist </s>
<s>  all that i can promise you therefore is not
to be in a hurry </s>
<s>  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object </s>
<s>  when i am in company with him i will not be wishing </s>
<s>  in short
i will do my best </s>
<s> 

perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often </s>
<s>  at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him </s>
<s> 

as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile </s>
<s>  very
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that </s>
<s>  but do not imagine
that he is always here so often </s>
<s>  it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week </s>
<s>  you know my mothers ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends </s>
<s>  but really and upon my
honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest </s>
<s>  and now i hope
you are satisfied </s>
<s> 

her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints they parted </s>
<s>  a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane </s>
<s>  but as he took up his abode with the lucases
his arrival was no great inconvenience to <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  his marriage was
now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that
she wished they might be happy </s>
<s>  thursday was to be the wedding day
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit </s>
<s>  and when she
rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and
reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her
out of the room </s>
<s>  as they went downstairs together charlotte said </s>
<s> 

i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza </s>
<s> 

that you certainly shall </s>
<s> 

and i have another favour to ask you </s>
<s>  will you come and see me </s>
<s> 

we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire </s>
<s> 

i am not likely to leave kent for some time </s>
<s>  promise me therefore to
come to hunsford </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit </s>
<s> 

my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i
hope you will consent to be of the party </s>
<s>  indeed eliza you will be as
welcome as either of them </s>
<s> 

the wedding took place </s>
<s>  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on
the subject as usual </s>
<s>  elizabeth soon heard from her friend </s>
<s>  and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been </s>
<s>  that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible </s>
<s>  elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was </s>
<s>  charlottes first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness </s>
<s>  there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be </s>
<s>  though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen </s>
<s>  she
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise </s>
<s>  the house furniture neighbourhood and
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most
friendly and obliging </s>
<s>  it was <abvr> collinss picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened </s>
<s>  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest </s>
<s> 

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london </s>
<s>  and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys </s>
<s> 

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is </s>
<s>  jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from caroline </s>
<s>  she accounted for it however by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost </s>
<s> 

my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the
town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street </s>
<s> 

she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley </s>
<s> 
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london </s>
<s>  i was right therefore my last letter had never reached
her </s>
<s>  i inquired after their brother of course </s>
<s>  he was well but so much
engaged with <abvr> darcy that they scarcely ever saw him </s>
<s>  i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner </s>
<s>  i wish i could see her </s>
<s>  my visit was
not long as caroline and <abvr> hurst were going out </s>
<s>  i dare say i shall
see them soon here </s>
<s> 

elizabeth shook her head over this letter </s>
<s>  it convinced her that
accident only could discover to <abvr> bingley her sisters being in town </s>
<s> 

four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him </s>
<s>  she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it </s>
<s>  but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingleys inattention </s>
<s>  after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the
visitor did at last appear </s>
<s>  but the shortness of her stay and yet more
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer </s>
<s>  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt </s>
<s> 

my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me </s>
<s>  but my dear sister
though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i
still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion </s>
<s>  i do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me </s>
<s>  but if the same circumstances were to
happen again i am sure i should be deceived again </s>
<s>  caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday </s>
<s>  and not a note not a line did i
receive in the meantime </s>
<s>  when she did come it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it </s>
<s>  she made a slight formal apology for not
calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was
in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer </s>
<s>  i pity
though i cannot help blaming her </s>
<s>  she was very wrong in singling me out
as she did </s>
<s>  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side </s>
<s>  but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it </s>
<s>  i need not explain myself farther </s>
<s>  and though we know
this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily
account for her behaviour to me </s>
<s>  and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable </s>
<s>  i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now
because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago </s>
<s> 
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said
herself </s>
<s>  and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy </s>
<s>  i
cannot understand it </s>
<s>  if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this </s>
<s>  but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought
and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  let me hear from you very
soon </s>
<s>  miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield
again of giving up the house but not with any certainty </s>
<s>  we had better
not mention it </s>
<s>  i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at hunsford </s>
<s>  pray go to see them with sir william and
maria </s>
<s>  i am sure you will be very comfortable there </s>
<s> yours etc </s>
<s> 

this letter gave elizabeth some pain </s>
<s>  but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least </s>
<s> 
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over </s>
<s>  she would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions </s>
<s>  his character sunk on
every review of it </s>
<s>  and as a punishment for him as well as a possible
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry <abvr>
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman and required information </s>
<s>  and elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself </s>
<s>  his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over
he was the admirer of some one else </s>
<s>  elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain </s>
<s> 
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune
permitted it </s>
<s>  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable </s>
<s>  but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than
in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence </s>
<s>

chapter 


with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold did january and february pass away </s>
<s>  march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford </s>
<s>  she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither </s>
<s>  but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty </s>
<s>  absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  there
was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake </s>
<s>  the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane </s>
<s>  and in short as the time drew near she would have
been very sorry for any delay </s>
<s>  everything however went on smoothly
and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch </s>
<s>  she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter </s>
<s>  the improvement
of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became
perfect as plan could be </s>
<s> 

the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter </s>
<s> 

the farewell between herself and <abvr> wickham was perfectly friendly </s>
<s>  on
his side even more </s>
<s>  his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired </s>
<s>  and in his manner
of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of
what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their
opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there
was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard </s>
<s>  and she parted from him convinced that
whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing </s>
<s> 

her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable </s>
<s>  sir william lucas and his daughter maria a
goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise </s>
<s>  elizabeth loved absurdities but
she had known sir williams too long </s>
<s>  he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood </s>
<s>  and his civilities were
worn out like his information </s>
<s> 

it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon </s>
<s>  as they drove to <abvr> gardiners
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival </s>
<s>  when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever </s>
<s>  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls
whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower </s>
<s>  all was joy and
kindness </s>
<s>  the day passed most pleasantly away </s>
<s>  the morning in bustle and
shopping and the evening at one of the theatres </s>
<s> 

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt </s>
<s>  their first object was her
sister </s>
<s>  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to
her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits there were periods of dejection </s>
<s>  it was reasonable however
to hope that they would not continue long </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and
complimented her on bearing it so well </s>
<s> 

but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king </s>
<s>  i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary </s>
<s> 

pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs
between the mercenary and the prudent motive </s>
<s>  where does discretion end
and avarice begin </s>
<s>  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me
because it would be imprudent </s>
<s>  and now because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is
mercenary </s>
<s> 

if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know
what to think </s>
<s> 

she is a very good kind of girl i believe </s>
<s>  i know no harm of her </s>
<s> 

but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death
made her mistress of this fortune </s>
<s> 

nowhy should he </s>
<s>  if it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally
poor </s>
<s> 

but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event </s>
<s> 

a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe </s>
<s>  if she does not object to it
why should we </s>
<s> 

her not objecting does not justify him </s>
<s>  it only shows her being
deficient in something herselfsense or feeling </s>
<s> 

well cried elizabeth have it as you choose </s>
<s>  he shall be
mercenary and she shall be foolish </s>
<s> 

no lizzy that is what i do not choose </s>
<s>  i should be sorry you know
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire </s>
<s>  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better </s>
<s>  i am sick of them all </s>
<s>  thank heaven </s>
<s>  i am going tomorrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him </s>
<s>  stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing after all </s>
<s> 

take care lizzy </s>
<s>  that speech savours strongly of disappointment </s>
<s> 

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer </s>
<s> 

we have not determined how far it shall carry us said <abvr> gardiner
but perhaps to the lakes </s>
<s> 

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful </s>
<s>  oh my dear
dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight </s>

give me fresh life and vigour </s>

chapter 


every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment </s>
<s>  for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight </s>
<s> 

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view </s>
<s> 
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side </s>
<s>  elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants </s>
<s> 

at length the parsonage was discernible </s>
<s>  the garden sloping to the
road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge
everything declared they were arriving </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins and charlotte
appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party </s>
<s>  in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing
at the sight of each other </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received </s>
<s>  she saw
instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage </s>
<s> 
his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family </s>
<s>  they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance taken into the house </s>
<s>  and as soon as they
were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes
offers of refreshment </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory </s>
<s>  and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its
aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him </s>
<s>  but
though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion </s>
<s> 
when <abvr> collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her
eye on charlotte </s>
<s>  once or twice she could discern a faint blush </s>
<s>  but
in general charlotte wisely did not hear </s>
<s>  after sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to
the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had
happened in london <abvr> collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself </s>
<s>  to work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures </s>
<s>  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible </s>
<s>  here leading the way
through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind </s>
<s>  he could number the
fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump </s>
<s>  but of all the views which his garden or which
the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the
prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house </s>
<s>  it was a handsome
modern building well situated on rising ground </s>
<s> 

from his garden <abvr> collins would have led them round his two meadows </s>
<s> 
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost turned back </s>
<s>  and while sir william accompanied him charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased
probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands
help </s>
<s>  it was rather small but well built and convenient </s>
<s>  and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit </s>
<s>  when <abvr> collins could be
forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by
charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten </s>
<s> 

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country </s>
<s>  it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when <abvr> collins joining
in observed </s>
<s> 

yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will
be delighted with her </s>
<s>  she is all affability and condescension and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over </s>
<s>  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here </s>
<s>  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming </s>
<s>  we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed
to walk home </s>
<s>  her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us </s>
<s>  i
should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several </s>
<s> 

lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added
charlotte and a most attentive neighbour </s>
<s> 

very true my dear that is exactly what i say </s>
<s>  she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference </s>
<s> 

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news
and telling again what had already been written </s>
<s>  and when it closed
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well </s>
<s>  she had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious
interruptions of <abvr> collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings </s>
<s>  a lively imagination soon settled it all </s>
<s> 

about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion </s>
<s>  and after listening a moment she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her </s>
<s>  she opened
the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with
agitation cried out

oh my dear eliza </s>
<s>  pray make haste and come into the diningroom for
there is such a sight to be seen </s>
<s>  i will not tell you what it is </s>
<s>  make
haste and come down this moment </s>
<s> 

elizabeth asked questions in vain </s>
<s>  maria would tell her nothing more
and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in
quest of this wonder </s>
<s>  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate </s>
<s> 

and is this all </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not
lady catherine </s>
<s>  the old lady is <abvr> jenkinson who lives with them </s>
<s> 
the other is miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  only look at her </s>
<s>  she is quite a little
creature </s>
<s>  who would have thought that she could be so thin and small </s>
<s> 

she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind </s>
<s> 
why does she not come in </s>
<s> 

oh charlotte says she hardly ever does </s>
<s>  it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in </s>
<s> 

i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas </s>
<s>  she
looks sickly and cross </s>
<s>  yes she will do for him very well </s>
<s>  she will
make him a very proper wife </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies </s>
<s>  and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was
stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way </s>
<s> 

at length there was nothing more to be said </s>
<s>  the ladies drove on and
the others returned into the house </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete </s>
<s> 
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife was exactly what he had wished for </s>
<s>  and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough </s>
<s> 

i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings </s>
<s>  i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it
would happen </s>
<s>  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this </s>
<s>  who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately
after your arrival </s>
<s> 

i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire </s>
<s>  about the court such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon </s>
<s> 

scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and
so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them </s>
<s> 

when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth

do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel </s>
<s>  lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter </s>
<s>  i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion
for anything more </s>
<s>  lady catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed </s>
<s>  she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved </s>
<s> 

while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner </s>
<s>  such formidable accounts of
her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at st </s>
<s>  jamess </s>
<s> 

as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park </s>
<s>  every park has its beauty and its prospects </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such
raptures as <abvr> collins expected the scene to inspire and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh </s>
<s> 

when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm </s>
<s> 
elizabeths courage did not fail her </s>
<s>  she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation </s>
<s> 

from the entrancehall of which <abvr> collins pointed out with a
rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they
followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady
catherine her daughter and <abvr> jenkinson were sitting </s>
<s>  her ladyship
with great condescension arose to receive them </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary </s>
<s> 

in spite of having been at st </s>
<s>  jamess sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word </s>
<s> 
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge
of her chair not knowing which way to look </s>
<s>  elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly </s>
<s>  lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked
features which might once have been handsome </s>
<s>  her air was not
conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank </s>
<s>  she was not rendered formidable by
silence </s>
<s>  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone
as marked her selfimportance and brought <abvr> wickham immediately to
elizabeths mind </s>
<s>  and from the observation of the day altogether she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented </s>
<s> 

when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of <abvr> darcy she turned her eyes on the
daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her
being so thin and so small </s>
<s>  there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies </s>
<s>  miss de bourgh was pale and sickly </s>
<s>  her
features though not plain were insignificant </s>
<s>  and she spoke very
little except in a low voice to <abvr> jenkinson in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes </s>
<s> 

after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view <abvr> collins attending them to point out its beauties
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer </s>
<s> 

the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which <abvr> collins had promised </s>
<s>  and as he had
likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her
ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater </s>
<s>  he carved and ate and praised with delighted
alacrity </s>
<s>  and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir
william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw
said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear </s>
<s> 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them </s>
<s>  the party did not supply much conversation </s>
<s>  elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all
dinnertime </s>
<s>  <abvr> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing
she was indisposed </s>
<s>  maria thought speaking out of the question and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire </s>
<s> 

when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to
be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted </s>
<s>  she inquired into charlottes domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all </s>
<s>  told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry </s>
<s>  elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others </s>
<s>  in the intervals of her discourse
with <abvr> collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew
the least and who she observed to <abvr> collins was a very genteel
pretty kind of girl </s>
<s>  she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of
them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been
her mothers maiden name </s>
<s>  elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly </s>
<s>  lady catherine then
observed

your fathers estate is entailed on <abvr> collins i think </s>
<s>  for your
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it </s>
<s>  but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line </s>
<s>  it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family </s>
<s>  do you play and sing miss
bennet </s>
<s> 

a little </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you </s>
<s>  our

<s>  do your sisters play and sing </s>

<s> 

no not at all </s>
<s> 

what none of you </s>
<s> 

not one </s>
<s> 

that is very strange </s>
<s>  but i suppose you had no opportunity </s>
<s>  your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters </s>
<s> 

my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london </s>
<s> 

has your governess left you </s>
<s> 

we never had any governess </s>
<s> 

no governess </s>
<s>  how was that possible </s>
<s>  five daughters brought up at home
without a governess </s>
<s>  i never heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case </s>
<s> 

then who taught you </s>
<s>  who attended to you </s>
<s>  without a governess you
must have been neglected </s>
<s> 

compared with some families i believe we were </s>
<s>  but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means </s>
<s>  we were always encouraged to
read and had all the masters that were necessary </s>
<s>  those who chose to be
idle certainly might </s>
<s> 

aye no doubt </s>
<s>  but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had
known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one </s>
<s>  i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it </s>
<s>  it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way </s>
<s>  i am always glad to get a young person well placed out </s>
<s>  four nieces
of <abvr> jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means </s>
<s>  and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person

delighted with her </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs
calling yesterday to thank me </s>
<s>  she finds miss pope a treasure </s>
<s>  �lady

<s>  are any of your

all </s>
<s>  what all five out at once </s>
<s>  very odd </s>
<s>  and you only the second </s>
<s>  the
younger ones out before the elder ones are married </s>
<s>  your younger sisters
must be very young </s>
<s> 

yes my youngest is not sixteen </s>
<s>  perhaps she is full young to be
much in company </s>
<s>  but really maam i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early </s>
<s>  the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first </s>
<s>  and to be kept back on such a motive </s>
<s>  i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind </s>
<s> 

upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person </s>
<s>  pray what is your age </s>
<s> 

with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it </s>
<s> 

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer </s>
<s> 
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence </s>
<s> 

you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not
conceal your age </s>
<s> 

i am not oneandtwenty </s>
<s> 

when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables
were placed </s>
<s>  lady catherine sir william and <abvr> and <abvr> collins sat

two girls had the honour of assisting <abvr> jenkinson to make up her
party </s>

uttered that did not relate to the game except when <abvr> jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or

and noble names </s>

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose

round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were

chapter 


sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with </s>
<s>  while sir william was with them <abvr> collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country </s>
<s>  but
when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom
which fronted the road </s>
<s>  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards </s>
<s> 
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the diningparlour for common use </s>
<s>  it was a better sized room and had a
more pleasant aspect </s>
<s>  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did for <abvr> collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively </s>
<s>  and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement </s>
<s> 

from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and
were indebted to <abvr> collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton
which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened
almost every day </s>
<s>  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and
had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out </s>
<s> 

very few days passed in which <abvr> collins did not walk to rosings and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise </s>
<s> 
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours </s>
<s>  now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits </s>
<s>  she examined into their employments looked at their work
and advised them to do it differently </s>
<s>  found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture </s>
<s>  or detected the housemaid in negligence </s>
<s>  and if she
accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that <abvr> collinss joints of meat were too large for her family </s>
<s> 

elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold
them into harmony and plenty </s>
<s> 

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week </s>
<s> 
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one
cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first </s>
<s>  their other engagements were few as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond <abvr> collinss reach </s>
<s>  this
however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough </s>
<s>  there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors </s>
<s>  her favourite walk and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity </s>
<s> 

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away </s>
<s> 
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be
important </s>
<s>  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that <abvr> darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently
destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself </s>
<s> 

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage </s>
<s>  for <abvr> collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great
intelligence </s>
<s>  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects </s>
<s>  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for
mr </s>
<s>  darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of
his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when
mr </s>
<s>  collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him </s>
<s>  charlotte had seen
them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding </s>
<s> 

i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and
address most truly the gentleman </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual
reserve to <abvr> collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend met her with every appearance of composure </s>
<s>  elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word </s>
<s> 

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly </s>
<s>  but
his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to <abvr> collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody </s>
<s> 
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family </s>
<s>  she answered him in the usual
way and after a moments pause added </s>
<s> 

my eldest sister has been in town these three months </s>
<s>  have you never
happened to see her there </s>
<s> 

she was perfectly sensible that he never had </s>
<s>  but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet </s>
<s>  the
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away </s>
<s> 



chapter 


colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at rosings </s>
<s>  it was some days however before they
received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary </s>
<s>  and it was not till easterday
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening </s>
<s>  for the last week they had seen very little
of lady catherine or her daughter </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the
parsonage more than once during the time but <abvr> darcy they had seen
only at church </s>
<s> 

the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherines drawingroom </s>
<s>  her ladyship received
them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else </s>
<s>  and she was in fact
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy
much more than to any other person in the room </s>
<s> 

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them </s>
<s>  anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings </s>
<s>  and <abvr> collinss pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much </s>
<s>  he now seated himself by her and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying
at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before </s>
<s>  and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself
as well as of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity </s>
<s>  and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not
scruple to call out </s>
<s> 

what is that you are saying fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  what is it you are talking
of </s>
<s>  what are you telling miss bennet </s>
<s>  let me hear what it is </s>
<s> 

we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid
a reply </s>
<s> 

of music </s>
<s>  then pray speak aloud </s>
<s>  it is of all subjects my delight </s>
<s>  i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music </s>
<s> 
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself or a better natural taste </s>
<s>  if i had ever learnt
i should have been a great proficient </s>
<s>  and so would anne if her health
had allowed her to apply </s>
<s>  i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully </s>
<s>  how does georgiana get on darcy </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency </s>
<s> 

i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady
catherine </s>
<s>  and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal </s>
<s> 

i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice </s>
<s> 
she practises very constantly </s>
<s> 

so much the better </s>
<s>  it cannot be done too much </s>
<s>  and when i next write
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account </s>
<s>  i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice </s>
<s>  i have told miss bennet several times that she
will never play really well unless she practises more </s>
<s>  and though <abvr>
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told
her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in <abvr>
jenkinsons room </s>
<s>  she would be in nobodys way you know in that part
of the house </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made
no answer </s>
<s> 

when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him </s>
<s>  and she sat down directly to the instrument </s>
<s>  he
drew a chair near her </s>
<s>  lady catherine listened to half a song and then
talked as before to her other nephew </s>
<s>  till the latter walked away
from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers
countenance </s>
<s>  elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said </s>
<s> 

you mean to frighten me <abvr> darcy by coming in all this state to hear
me </s>
<s>  i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well </s>
<s>  there
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others </s>
<s>  my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me </s>
<s> 

i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you </s>
<s>  and i have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own </s>
<s> 

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me and teach you not to believe a word i say </s>
<s>  i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part
of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit </s>
<s>  indeed <abvr> darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to
say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear </s>
<s> 

i am not afraid of you said he smilingly </s>
<s> 

pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel
fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  i should like to know how he behaves among strangers </s>
<s> 

you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful </s>
<s> 
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know
was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did </s>
<s>  he danced
only four dances though gentlemen were scarce </s>
<s>  and to my certain
knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy you cannot deny the fact </s>
<s> 

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s>  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom </s>
<s>  well colonel
fitzwilliam what do i play next </s>
<s>  my fingers wait your orders </s>
<s> 

perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction </s>
<s>  but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers </s>
<s> 

shall we ask your cousin the reason of this </s>
<s>  said elizabeth still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers </s>
<s> 

i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to
him </s>
<s>  it is because he will not give himself the trouble </s>
<s> 

i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before </s>
<s>  i cannot
catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their
concerns as i often see done </s>
<s> 

my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many womens do </s>
<s>  they have not the same
force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression </s>
<s>  but then i
have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the
trouble of practising </s>
<s>  it is not that i do not believe my fingers as
capable as any other womans of superior execution </s>
<s> 

darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right </s>
<s>  you have employed your
time much better </s>
<s>  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting </s>
<s>  we neither of us perform to strangers </s>
<s> 

here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know
what they were talking of </s>
<s>  elizabeth immediately began playing again </s>
<s> 
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said
to darcy </s>
<s> 

miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and
could have the advantage of a london master </s>
<s>  she has a very good notion
of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes </s>
<s>  anne would have
been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousins praise </s>
<s>  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love </s>
<s>  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation </s>
<s> 

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste </s>
<s>  elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was
ready to take them all home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane
while <abvr> collins and maria were gone on business into the village
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a
visitor </s>
<s>  as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to
be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her
halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions
when the door opened and to her very great surprise <abvr> darcy and
mr </s>
<s>  darcy only entered the room </s>
<s> 

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within </s>
<s> 

they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence </s>
<s>  it was absolutely
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure she observed </s>
<s> 

how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to <abvr> bingley to see you
all after him so soon </s>
<s>  for if i recollect right he went but the day
before </s>
<s>  he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london </s>
<s> 

perfectly so i thank you </s>
<s> 

she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short
pause added </s>
<s> 

i think i have understood that <abvr> bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again </s>
<s> 

i have never heard him say so </s>
<s>  but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future </s>
<s>  he has many friends and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing </s>
<s> 

if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we
might possibly get a settled family there </s>
<s>  but perhaps <abvr> bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle </s>
<s> 

i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no answer </s>
<s>  she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend </s>
<s>  and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him </s>
<s> 

he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable
house </s>
<s>  lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when <abvr>
collins first came to hunsford </s>
<s> 

i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife </s>
<s> 

yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made
him happy if they had </s>
<s>  my friend has an excellent understandingthough
i am not certain that i consider her marrying <abvr> collins as the
wisest thing she ever did </s>
<s>  she seems perfectly happy however and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her </s>
<s> 

it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends </s>
<s> 

an easy distance do you call it </s>
<s>  it is nearly fifty miles </s>
<s> 

and what is fifty miles of good road </s>
<s>  little more than half a days
journey </s>
<s>  yes i call it a very easy distance </s>
<s> 

i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
of the match cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  i should never have said <abvr> collins
was settled near her family </s>
<s> 

it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire </s>
<s>  anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far </s>
<s> 

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood </s>
<s>  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield and she blushed as she answered </s>
<s> 

i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family </s>
<s>  the far and the near must be relative and depend on many
varying circumstances </s>
<s>  where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil </s>
<s>  but that is not the
case here </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> collins have a comfortable income but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half
the present distance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment </s>
<s>  you cannot have
been always at longbourn </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked surprised </s>
<s>  the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling </s>
<s>  he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and
glancing over it said in a colder voice </s>
<s> 

are you pleased with kent </s>
<s> 

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side
calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister just returned from her walk </s>
<s>  the teteatete surprised
them </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody went away </s>
<s> 

what can be the meaning of this </s>
<s>  said charlotte as soon as he was
gone </s>
<s>  my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never
have called us in this familiar way </s>
<s> 

but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely
even to charlottes wishes to be the case </s>
<s>  and after various
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable
from the time of year </s>
<s>  all field sports were over </s>
<s>  within doors there
was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors </s>
<s>  and in the nearness of the parsonage or the
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day </s>
<s>  they called at various times of the morning sometimes
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their
aunt </s>
<s>  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more </s>
<s>  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her
former favourite george wickham </s>
<s>  and though in comparing them she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners
she believed he might have the best informed mind </s>
<s> 

but why <abvr> darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand </s>
<s>  it could not be for society as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips </s>
<s>  and when he did speak
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice
to propriety not a pleasure to himself </s>
<s>  he seldom appeared really
animated </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins knew not what to make of him </s>
<s>  colonel
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her </s>
<s>  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself
seriously to work to find it out </s>
<s>  she watched him whenever they were at
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford </s>
<s>  but without much success </s>
<s>  he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that
look was disputable </s>
<s>  it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind </s>
<s> 

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment </s>
<s>  for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would
vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power </s>
<s> 


in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s>  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man </s>
<s>  he
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible </s>
<s>  but
to counterbalance these advantages <abvr> darcy had considerable patronage
in the church and his cousin could have none at all </s>
<s> 



chapter 


more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park
unexpectedly meet <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to
prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers </s>
<s>  how it could occur a second time
therefore was very odd </s>
<s>  yet it did and even a third </s>
<s>  it seemed like
wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her </s>
<s>  he
never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much </s>
<s>  but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout
her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her
opinion of <abvr> and <abvr> collinss happiness </s>
<s>  and that in speaking of
rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
there too </s>
<s>  his words seemed to imply it </s>
<s>  could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts </s>
<s>  she supposed if he meant anything he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter </s>
<s>  it distressed
her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the parsonage </s>
<s> 

she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter
and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in
spirits when instead of being again surprised by <abvr> darcy she saw
on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her </s>
<s>  putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile she said </s>
<s> 

i did not know before that you ever walked this way </s>
<s> 

i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally
do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage </s>
<s>  are
you going much farther </s>
<s> 

no i should have turned in a moment </s>
<s> 

and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage
together </s>
<s> 

do you certainly leave kent on saturday </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

yesif darcy does not put it off again </s>
<s>  but i am at his disposal </s>
<s>  he
arranges the business just as he pleases </s>
<s> 

and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice </s>
<s>  i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam </s>
<s> 
but so we all do </s>
<s>  it is only that he has better means of having it
than many others because he is rich and many others are poor </s>
<s>  i speak
feelingly </s>
<s>  a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and
dependence </s>
<s> 

in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either </s>
<s>  now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and
dependence </s>
<s>  when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for </s>
<s> 

these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature </s>
<s>  but in matters of greater
weight i may suffer from want of money </s>
<s>  younger sons cannot marry where
they like </s>
<s> 

unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often
do </s>
<s> 

our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money </s>
<s> 

is this thought elizabeth meant for me </s>
<s>  and she coloured at the
idea </s>
<s>  but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what
is the usual price of an earls younger son </s>
<s>  unless the elder brother is
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped </s>
<s>  to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed
she soon afterwards said </s>
<s> 

i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal </s>
<s>  i wonder he does not marry to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind </s>
<s>  but perhaps his sister does as well
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he
likes with her </s>
<s> 

no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must
divide with me </s>
<s>  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy </s>
<s> 

are you indeed </s>
<s>  and pray what sort of guardians do you make </s>
<s>  does your
charge give you much trouble </s>
<s>  young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she
may like to have her own way </s>
<s> 

as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly </s>
<s>  and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth </s>
<s>  she directly replied </s>
<s> 

you need not be frightened </s>
<s>  i never heard any harm of her </s>
<s>  and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world </s>
<s>  she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance <abvr> hurst and
miss bingley </s>
<s>  i think i have heard you say that you know them </s>
<s> 

i know them a little </s>
<s>  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe
is a great friend of darcys </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes said elizabeth drily </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is uncommonly kind to <abvr>
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him </s>
<s> 

care of him </s>
<s>  yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care </s>
<s>  from something that he told me in
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him </s>
<s>  but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant </s>
<s>  it was all conjecture </s>
<s> 

what is it you mean </s>
<s> 

it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known
because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an
unpleasant thing </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon my not mentioning it </s>
<s> 

and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley </s>
<s>  what he told me was merely this </s>
<s>  that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer </s>
<s> 

did <abvr> darcy give you reasons for this interference </s>
<s> 

i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady </s>
<s> 

and what arts did he use to separate them </s>
<s> 

he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling </s>
<s>  he
only told me what i have now told you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with
indignation </s>
<s>  after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful </s>
<s> 

i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she </s>
<s>  your
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings </s>
<s>  why was he to be the judge </s>
<s> 

you are rather disposed to call his interference officious </s>
<s> 

i do not see what right <abvr> darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy </s>
<s> 
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the
particulars it is not fair to condemn him </s>
<s>  it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case </s>
<s> 

that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly </s>
<s> 

this was spoken jestingly </s>
<s>  but it appeared to her so just a picture
of <abvr> darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the parsonage </s>
<s>  there shut into her own room
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard </s>
<s>  it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected </s>
<s>  there
could not exist in the world two men over whom <abvr> darcy could have
such boundless influence </s>
<s>  that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted </s>
<s>  but she had
always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them </s>
<s>  if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was
the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had
suffered and still continued to suffer </s>
<s>  he had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the
world </s>
<s>  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted </s>
<s> 

there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel
fitzwilliams words </s>
<s>  and those strong objections probably were her
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in
business in london </s>
<s> 

to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of
objection </s>
<s>  all loveliness and goodness as she is </s>
<s> her understanding
excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating </s>
<s>  neither
could anything be urged against my father who though with some
peculiarities has abilities <abvr> darcy himself need not disdain and
respectability which he will probably never reach </s>
<s>  when she thought of
her mother her confidence gave way a little </s>
<s>  but she would not allow
that any objections there had material weight with <abvr> darcy whose
pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense </s>
<s> 
and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining <abvr>
bingley for his sister </s>
<s> 

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache </s>
<s>  and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to
her unwillingness to see <abvr> darcy it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her </s>
<s>  but <abvr> collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather
displeased by her staying at home </s>
<s> 



chapter 


when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against <abvr> darcy chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent </s>
<s>  they contained no actual complaint nor was there any
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering </s>
<s> 
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded </s>
<s>  elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcys
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her
a keener sense of her sisters sufferings </s>
<s>  it was some consolation
to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the
nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits by all that affection could do </s>
<s> 

she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him </s>
<s>  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not
mean to be unhappy about him </s>
<s> 

while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in
the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her </s>
<s> 
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently
affected when to her utter amazement she saw <abvr> darcy walk into the
room </s>
<s>  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better </s>
<s> 
she answered him with cold civility </s>
<s>  he sat down for a few moments and
then getting up walked about the room </s>
<s>  elizabeth was surprised but
said not a word </s>
<s>  after a silence of several minutes he came towards her
in an agitated manner and thus began </s>
<s> 

in vain i have struggled </s>
<s>  it will not do </s>
<s>  my feelings will not be
repressed </s>
<s>  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you </s>
<s> 

elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression </s>
<s>  she stared coloured
doubted and was silent </s>
<s>  this he considered sufficient encouragement </s>
<s> 
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her
immediately followed </s>
<s>  he spoke well </s>
<s>  but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed </s>
<s>  and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride </s>
<s>  his sense of her inferiorityof
its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit </s>
<s> 

in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive </s>
<s>  till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she
lost all compassion in anger </s>
<s>  she tried however to compose herself to
answer him with patience when he should have done </s>
<s>  he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite
of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer </s>
<s>  and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand </s>
<s>  as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer </s>
<s>  he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but
his countenance expressed real security </s>
<s>  such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her
cheeks and she said </s>
<s> 

in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however
unequally they may be returned </s>
<s>  it is natural that obligation should
be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you </s>
<s>  but i
cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly </s>
<s>  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone </s>
<s>  it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be
of short duration </s>
<s>  the feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise </s>
<s>  his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature </s>
<s>  he was struggling for the
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it </s>
<s>  the pause was to elizabeths feelings
dreadful </s>
<s>  at length with a voice of forced calmness he said </s>
<s> 

and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting </s>
<s> 
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at
civility i am thus rejected </s>
<s>  but it is of small importance </s>
<s> 

i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will against your reason and even against your character </s>
<s> 
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil </s>
<s>  but i have
other provocations </s>
<s>  you know i have </s>
<s>  had not my feelings decided against
youhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most
beloved sister </s>
<s> 

as she pronounced these words <abvr> darcy changed colour </s>
<s>  but the emotion
was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued </s>
<s> 

i have every reason in the world to think ill of you </s>
<s>  no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there </s>
<s>  you dare not
you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means
of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind </s>
<s> 

she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse </s>
<s> 
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity </s>
<s> 

can you deny that you have done it </s>
<s>  she repeated </s>
<s> 

with assumed tranquillity he then replied </s>
<s>  i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister or that i rejoice in my success </s>
<s>  towards him i have been
kinder than towards myself </s>
<s> 

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her </s>
<s> 

but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike
is founded </s>
<s>  long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided </s>
<s>  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  on this subject what can you have to
say </s>
<s>  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself </s>
<s> 
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others </s>
<s> 

you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy
in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour </s>
<s> 

who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him </s>
<s> 

his misfortunes </s>
<s>  repeated darcy contemptuously </s>
<s>  yes his misfortunes
have been great indeed </s>
<s> 

and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy </s>
<s>  you have reduced
him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty </s>
<s>  you have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him </s>
<s>  you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert </s>
<s>  you have done all this </s>
<s> 
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule </s>
<s> 

and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room
is your opinion of me </s>
<s>  this is the estimation in which you hold me </s>
<s> 
i thank you for explaining it so fully </s>
<s>  my faults according to this
calculation are heavy indeed </s>
<s>  but perhaps added he stopping in
his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design </s>
<s>  these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater
policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination </s>
<s>  by reason by
reflection by everything </s>
<s>  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence </s>
<s> 
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related </s>
<s>  they were natural and
just </s>
<s>  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections </s>
<s> to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment </s>
<s>  yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken <abvr> darcy if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern
which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner </s>
<s> 

she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued </s>
<s> 

you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it </s>
<s> 

again his astonishment was obvious </s>
<s>  and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification </s>
<s>  she went on </s>
<s> 

from the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayof
my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike </s>
<s>  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry </s>
<s> 

you have said quite enough madam </s>
<s>  i perfectly comprehend your
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been </s>
<s> 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness </s>
<s> 

and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house </s>
<s> 

the tumult of her mind was now painfully great </s>
<s>  she knew not how
to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
halfanhour </s>
<s>  her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed
was increased by every review of it </s>
<s>  that she should receive an offer of
marriage from <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  that he should have been in love with her for
so many months </s>
<s>  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying
her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own casewas almost incredible </s>
<s>  it was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection </s>
<s>  but his pride his abominable
pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could
not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned <abvr>
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited </s>
<s>  she continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes </s>
<s>  she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened </s>
<s>  it was impossible to think of anything
else </s>
<s>  and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise </s>
<s>  she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of <abvr> darcys
sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park
she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad </s>
<s>  the
park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground </s>
<s> 

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and
look into the park </s>
<s>  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees </s>
<s>  she was on the point of continuing her walk
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park </s>
<s>  he was moving that way </s>
<s>  and fearful of its being <abvr>
darcy she was directly retreating </s>
<s>  but the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced
her name </s>
<s>  she had turned away </s>
<s>  but on hearing herself called though
in a voice which proved it to be <abvr> darcy she moved again towards the
gate </s>
<s>  he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure
i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you </s>
<s> 
will you do me the honour of reading that letter </s>
<s>  and then with a
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight </s>
<s> 

with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity
elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written
quite through in a very close hand </s>
<s>  the envelope itself was likewise
full </s>
<s>  pursuing her way along the lane she then began it </s>
<s>  it was dated
from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows </s>
<s> 

be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you </s>
<s>  i write without any
intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes
which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten </s>
<s>  and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion
should have been spared had not my character required it to be written
and read </s>
<s>  you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention </s>
<s>  your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i
demand it of your justice </s>
<s> 

two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal
magnitude you last night laid to my charge </s>
<s>  the first mentioned was
that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <abvr> bingley
from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various
claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged
favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could
bear no comparison </s>
<s>  but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope
to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read </s>
<s>  if in the explanation of them which
is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry </s>
<s>  the necessity
must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd </s>
<s> 

i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with
others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country </s>
<s>  but it was not till the evening of the dance
at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment </s>
<s>  i had often seen him in love before </s>
<s>  at that ball while i
had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir
william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage </s>
<s> 
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could
be undecided </s>
<s>  from that moment i observed my friends behaviour
attentively </s>
<s>  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss
bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him </s>
<s>  your sister i also
watched </s>
<s>  her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever
but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced
from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions
with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment </s>
<s>  if you have not been mistaken here i must have been
in error </s>
<s>  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable </s>
<s>  if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable </s>
<s>  but i shall not
scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be
easily touched </s>
<s>  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears </s>
<s>  i did not believe
her to be indifferent because i wished it </s>
<s>  i believed it on impartial
conviction as truly as i wished it in reason </s>
<s>  my objections to the
marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case </s>
<s>  the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me </s>
<s>  but
there were other causes of repugnance </s>
<s>  causes which though still
existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had
myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before
me </s>
<s>  these causes must be stated though briefly </s>
<s>  the situation of your
mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your
father </s>
<s>  pardon me </s>
<s>  it pains me to offend you </s>
<s>  but amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this
representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both </s>
<s>  i will only say
farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties
was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
connection </s>
<s>  he left netherfield for london on the day following as
you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning </s>
<s> 

the part which i acted is now to be explained </s>
<s>  his sisters uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own </s>
<s>  our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
london </s>
<s>  we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice </s>
<s>  i
described and enforced them earnestly </s>
<s>  but however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been
seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your
sisters indifference </s>
<s>  he had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere if not with equal regard </s>
<s>  but bingley has great
natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own </s>
<s>  to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was
no very difficult point </s>
<s>  to persuade him against returning into
hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the
work of a moment </s>
<s>  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much </s>
<s>  there
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not
reflect with satisfaction </s>
<s>  it is that i condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in
town </s>
<s>  i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley </s>
<s>  but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it </s>
<s>  that they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable </s>
<s>  but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger </s>
<s>  perhaps this
concealment this disguise was beneath me </s>
<s>  it is done however and it
was done for the best </s>
<s>  on this subject i have nothing more to say no
other apology to offer </s>
<s>  if i have wounded your sisters feelings it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn
them </s>
<s> 

with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured
mr </s>
<s>  wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family </s>
<s>  of what he has particularly accused me i
am ignorant </s>
<s>  but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many
years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him </s>
<s>  and on george wickham who was his godson his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed </s>
<s>  my father supported him at
school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his
own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have
been unable to give him a gentlemans education </s>
<s>  my father was not only
fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging </s>
<s>  he
had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be
his profession intended to provide for him in it </s>
<s>  as for myself it is
many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different
manner </s>
<s>  the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <abvr>
darcy could not have </s>
<s>  here again i shall give you painto what degree
you only can tell </s>
<s>  but whatever may be the sentiments which <abvr> wickham
has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive </s>
<s> 

my excellent father died about five years ago </s>
<s>  and his attachment to
mr </s>
<s>  wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant </s>
<s>  there
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds </s>
<s>  his own father did not long
survive mine and within half a year from these events <abvr> wickham
wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders
he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he
could not be benefited </s>
<s>  he had some intention he added of studying
law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein </s>
<s>  i rather wished than believed
him to be sincere </s>
<s>  but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal </s>
<s>  i knew that <abvr> wickham ought not to be a clergyman </s>
<s>  the
business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance
in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds </s>
<s>  all connection
between us seemed now dissolved </s>
<s>  i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley or admit his society in town </s>
<s>  in town i believe he chiefly
lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free
from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation </s>
<s> 
for about three years i heard little of him </s>
<s>  but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation </s>
<s>  his circumstances he assured
me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad </s>
<s>  he
had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in
questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was
well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not
have forgotten my revered fathers intentions </s>
<s>  you will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every
repetition to it </s>
<s>  his resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself </s>
<s>  after this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped </s>
<s>  how he lived i know not </s>
<s>  but
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice </s>
<s> 

i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being </s>
<s>  having said thus much i feel no doubt of your
secrecy </s>
<s>  my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to
the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself </s>
<s> 
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed
for her in london </s>
<s>  and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it to ramsgate </s>
<s>  and thither also went <abvr> wickham undoubtedly by
design </s>
<s>  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and <abvr> younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived </s>
<s>  and
by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and
to consent to an elopement </s>
<s>  she was then but fifteen which must be her
excuse </s>
<s>  and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed
the knowledge of it to herself </s>
<s>  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father acknowledged the whole to me </s>
<s>  you may imagine what i felt and
how i acted </s>
<s>  regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure </s>
<s>  but i wrote to <abvr> wickham who left the place
immediately and <abvr> younge was of course removed from her charge </s>
<s>  <abvr>
wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which
is thirty thousand pounds </s>
<s>  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement </s>
<s>  his revenge would have
been complete indeed </s>
<s> 

this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together </s>
<s>  and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <abvr>
wickham </s>
<s>  i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you </s>
<s>  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at </s>
<s>  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either
detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination </s>
<s> 

you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night </s>
<s>  but
i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed </s>
<s>  for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of
the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions </s>
<s>  if your abhorrence of me
should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin </s>
<s>  and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning </s>
<s>  i will only add god bless you </s>

fitzwilliam darcy



chapter 


if elizabeth when <abvr> darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents </s>
<s>  but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited </s>
<s> 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined </s>
<s>  with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power </s>
<s> 
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation
to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal </s>
<s>  with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what
had happened at netherfield </s>
<s>  she read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes </s>
<s>  his belief of her sisters insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false </s>
<s>  and his account of the real the worst
objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice </s>
<s>  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her </s>
<s>  his style was not penitent but haughty </s>
<s>  it was all pride and
insolence </s>
<s> 

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <abvr> wickhamwhen
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition </s>
<s> 
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her </s>
<s>  she wished
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false </s>
<s> 
this cannot be </s>
<s>  this must be the grossest falsehood </s>
<s> and when she had
gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not
regard it that she would never look in it again </s>
<s> 

in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on
nothing she walked on </s>
<s>  but it would not do </s>
<s>  in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence </s>
<s> 
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself </s>
<s>  and the kindness of the late <abvr> darcy though
she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own
words </s>
<s>  so far each recital confirmed the other </s>
<s>  but when she came to the
will the difference was great </s>
<s>  what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other </s>
<s>  and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err </s>
<s>  but when she read and reread with the closest attention the
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate </s>
<s>  she put down
the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with
little success </s>
<s>  on both sides it was only assertion </s>
<s>  again she read
on </s>
<s>  but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render <abvr> darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole </s>
<s> 

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
mr </s>
<s>  wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her </s>
<s>  the more so as she could
bring no proof of its injustice </s>
<s>  she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town
had there renewed a slight acquaintance </s>
<s>  of his former way of life
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself </s>
<s>  as
to his real character had information been in her power she had
never felt a wish of inquiring </s>
<s>  his countenance voice and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue </s>
<s>  she tried
to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of
mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what <abvr> darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance </s>
<s>  but
no such recollection befriended her </s>
<s>  she could see him instantly before
her in every charm of air and address </s>
<s>  but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess </s>
<s>  after
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to
read </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  the story which followed of his designs on miss
darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before </s>
<s>  and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no
reason to question </s>
<s>  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that <abvr> darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his
cousins corroboration </s>
<s> 

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at <abvr> phillipss </s>
<s> 
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory </s>
<s>  she was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and
wondered it had escaped her before </s>
<s>  she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct </s>
<s>  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing <abvr> darcythat <abvr> darcy might leave the country but that
he should stand his ground </s>
<s>  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week </s>
<s>  she remembered also that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but
herself </s>
<s>  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed </s>
<s> 
that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking <abvr> darcys
character though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son </s>
<s> 

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned </s>
<s> 
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary </s>
<s>  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything </s>
<s> 
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive </s>
<s>  he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown </s>
<s>  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter </s>
<s>  and in farther justification of <abvr> darcy she could not
but allow that <abvr> bingley when questioned by jane had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair </s>
<s>  that proud and repulsive as
were his manners she had never in the whole course of their
acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits </s>
<s>  that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling </s>
<s>  that had his
actions been what <abvr> wickham represented them so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world </s>
<s>  and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as <abvr> bingley was incomprehensible </s>
<s> 

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself </s>
<s>  of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced
absurd </s>
<s> 

how despicably i have acted </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  i who have prided myself
on my discernment </s>
<s>  i who have valued myself on my abilities </s>
<s>  who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust </s>
<s>  how humiliating is this
discovery </s>
<s>  yet how just a humiliation </s>
<s>  had i been in love i could
not have been more wretchedly blind </s>
<s>  but vanity not love has been my
folly </s>
<s>  pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were
concerned </s>
<s>  till this moment i never knew myself </s>
<s> 

from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that <abvr> darcys explanation
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again </s>
<s>  widely
different was the effect of a second perusal </s>
<s>  how could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to
give in the other </s>
<s>  he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sisters attachment </s>
<s>  and she could not help remembering what charlottes
opinion had always been </s>
<s>  neither could she deny the justice of his
description of jane </s>
<s>  she felt that janes feelings though fervent were
little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility </s>
<s> 

when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense
of shame was severe </s>
<s>  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers </s>
<s> 

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt </s>
<s>  it soothed
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
selfattracted by the rest of her family </s>
<s>  and as she considered
that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before </s>
<s> 

after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every
variety of thoughtreconsidering events determining probabilities
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made
her at length return home </s>
<s>  and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation </s>
<s> 

she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy only for a few minutes to take
leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found </s>
<s>  elizabeth could but just affect concern
in missing him </s>
<s>  she really rejoiced at it </s>
<s>  colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object </s>
<s>  she could think only of her letter </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and <abvr> collins having
been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings </s>
<s>  to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter </s>
<s>  and on his return
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece </s>
<s>  nor could she think without a smile of what her
ladyships indignation would have been </s>
<s>  what would she have said </s>
<s>  how
would she have behaved </s>
<s>  were questions with which she amused herself </s>
<s> 

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party </s>
<s>  i assure
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine </s>
<s>  i believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as i do </s>
<s>  but i am particularly
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to
me </s>
<s>  they were excessively sorry to go </s>
<s>  but so they always are </s>
<s>  the
dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last </s>
<s>  but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year </s>
<s>  his
attachment to rosings certainly increases </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter </s>
<s> 

lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits and immediately accounting for it by herself by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon she added </s>
<s> 

but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins will be very glad of your
company i am sure </s>
<s> 

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied
elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it </s>
<s>  i must be in town
next saturday </s>
<s> 

why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks </s>
<s>  i expected
you to stay two months </s>
<s>  i told <abvr> collins so before you came </s>
<s>  there
can be no occasion for your going so soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight </s>
<s> 

but my father cannot </s>
<s>  he wrote last week to hurry my return </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  your father of course may spare you if your mother can </s>
<s>  daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father </s>
<s>  and if you will stay
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london for i am going there early in june for a week </s>
<s>  and as
dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room
for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large </s>
<s> 

you are all kindness madam </s>
<s>  but i believe we must abide by our
original plan </s>
<s> 

lady catherine seemed resigned </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins you must send a servant
with them </s>
<s>  you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves </s>
<s>  it is highly improper </s>
<s> 
you must contrive to send somebody </s>
<s>  i have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing </s>
<s>  young women should always be properly
guarded and attended according to their situation in life </s>
<s>  when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her
having two menservants go with her </s>
<s>  miss darcy the daughter of
mr </s>
<s>  darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner </s>
<s>  i am excessively attentive to all those
things </s>
<s>  you must send john with the young ladies <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  i
am glad it occurred to me to mention it </s>
<s>  for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone </s>
<s> 

my uncle is to send a servant for us </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  your uncle </s>
<s>  he keeps a manservant does he </s>
<s>  i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things </s>
<s>  where shall you change horses </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  bromley of course </s>
<s>  if you mention my name at the bell you will be
attended to </s>
<s> 

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her </s>
<s>  or with a mind so
occupied she might have forgotten where she was </s>
<s>  reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours </s>
<s>  whenever she was alone she gave way to it
as the greatest relief </s>
<s>  and not a day went by without a solitary
walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart </s>
<s>  she
studied every sentence </s>
<s>  and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different </s>
<s>  when she remembered the style of his address
she was still full of indignation </s>
<s>  but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against
herself </s>
<s>  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion </s>
<s> 
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect </s>
<s>  but she
could not approve him </s>
<s>  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again </s>
<s>  in her own past
behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret </s>
<s>  and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin </s>
<s> 
they were hopeless of remedy </s>
<s>  her father contented with laughing at
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters </s>
<s>  and her mother with manners so far from right
herself was entirely insensible of the evil </s>
<s>  elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia </s>
<s>  but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence
what chance could there be of improvement </s>
<s>  catherine weakspirited
irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always
affronted by their advice </s>
<s>  and lydia selfwilled and careless would
scarcely give them a hearing </s>
<s>  they were ignorant idle and vain </s>
<s>  while
there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him </s>
<s>  and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there
forever </s>
<s> 

anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern </s>
<s>  and <abvr> darcys
explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion
heightened the sense of what jane had lost </s>
<s>  his affection was proved
to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend </s>
<s>  how
grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every
respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had
been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family </s>
<s> 

when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful </s>
<s> 

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first </s>
<s>  the very last evening was spent
there </s>
<s>  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh </s>
<s> 

when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them
a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year </s>
<s> 
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both </s>
<s> 



chapter 


on saturday morning elizabeth and <abvr> collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared </s>
<s>  and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary </s>
<s> 

i know not miss elizabeth said he whether <abvr> collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us </s>
<s>  but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it </s>
<s>  the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you </s>
<s>  we
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode </s>
<s>  our plain
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we
see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself </s>
<s>  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness </s>
<s>  she
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment </s>
<s>  and the pleasure of being with
charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her
feel the obliged </s>
<s>  <abvr> collins was gratified and with a more smiling
solemnity replied </s>
<s> 

it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably </s>
<s>  we have certainly done our best </s>
<s>  and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and
from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome </s>
<s>  our situation with regard to
lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast </s>
<s>  you see on what a footing we are </s>
<s>  you
see how continually we are engaged there </s>
<s>  in truth i must acknowledge
that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are
sharers of our intimacy at rosings </s>
<s> 

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings </s>
<s>  and he was
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences </s>
<s> 

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire my dear cousin </s>
<s>  i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so </s>
<s>  lady catherines great attentions to <abvr> collins you
have been a daily witness of </s>
<s>  and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be
as well to be silent </s>
<s>  only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage </s>
<s>  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking </s>
<s>  there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us </s>
<s>  we seem to have been designed for each
other </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts </s>
<s>  she was not sorry however to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang </s>
<s> 
poor charlotte </s>
<s>  it was melancholy to leave her to such society </s>
<s>  but she
had chosen it with her eyes open </s>
<s>  and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion </s>
<s>  her
home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their
dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms </s>
<s> 

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready </s>
<s>  after an affectionate
parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr </s>
<s>  collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his
compliments to <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner though unknown </s>
<s>  he then handed her
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed
when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings </s>
<s> 

but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no objection </s>
<s>  the door was then allowed to be shut and
the carriage drove off </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems
but a day or two since we first came </s>
<s>  and yet how many things have
happened </s>
<s> 

a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh </s>
<s> 

we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice </s>
<s> 
how much i shall have to tell </s>
<s> 

elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to conceal </s>
<s> 

their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm </s>
<s>  and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached <abvr> gardiners
house where they were to remain a few days </s>
<s> 

jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them </s>
<s>  but jane was to go home with her and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation </s>
<s> 

it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn before she told her sister of <abvr> darcys proposals </s>
<s>  to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate </s>
<s> 
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried
into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister
further </s>

chapter 


it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of  in hertfordshire </s>
<s> 
and as they drew near the appointed inn where <abvr> bennets carriage
was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs </s>
<s> 
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and
dressing a salad and cucumber </s>
<s> 

after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming
is not this nice </s>
<s>  is not this an agreeable surprise </s>
<s> 

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there </s>
<s>  then showing
her purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet </s>
<s>  i do not think
it is very pretty </s>
<s>  but i thought i might as well buy it as not </s>
<s>  i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any
better </s>
<s> 

and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect
unconcern oh </s>
<s>  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop </s>
<s>  and
when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i
think it will be very tolerable </s>
<s>  besides it will not much signify what
one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they
are going in a fortnight </s>
<s> 

are they indeed </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction </s>
<s> 

they are going to be encamped near brighton </s>
<s>  and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer </s>
<s>  it would be such a delicious scheme </s>
<s> 
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all </s>
<s>  mamma would like to
go too of all things </s>
<s>  only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have </s>
<s> 

yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed
and completely do for us at once </s>
<s>  good heaven </s>
<s>  brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton </s>
<s> 

now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down at
table </s>
<s>  what do you think </s>
<s>  it is excellent newscapital newsand about
a certain person we all like </s>
<s> 

jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need
not stay </s>
<s>  lydia laughed and said </s>
<s> 

aye that is just like your formality and discretion </s>
<s>  you thought the
waiter must not hear as if he cared </s>
<s>  i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say </s>
<s>  but he is an ugly fellow </s>
<s>  i am glad
he is gone </s>
<s>  i never saw such a long chin in my life </s>
<s>  well but now for
my news </s>
<s>  it is about dear wickham </s>
<s>  too good for the waiter is it not </s>
<s> 
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king </s>
<s>  theres for you </s>
<s>  she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool </s>
<s>  gone to stay </s>
<s>  wickham is safe </s>
<s> 

and mary king is safe </s>
<s>  added elizabeth </s>
<s>  safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune </s>
<s> 

she is a great fool for going away if she liked him </s>
<s> 

but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane </s>
<s> 

i am sure there is not on his </s>
<s>  i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled
thing </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal </s>
<s> 

as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was
ordered </s>
<s>  and after some contrivance the whole party with all their
boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and
lydias purchases were seated in it </s>
<s> 

how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia </s>
<s>  i am glad i bought my
bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox </s>
<s>  well now
let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way
home </s>
<s>  and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away </s>
<s>  have you seen any pleasant men </s>
<s>  have you had any
flirting </s>
<s>  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back </s>
<s>  jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare </s>
<s> 
she is almost threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  lord how ashamed i should be of not
being married before threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  my aunt phillips wants you so to
get husbands you cant think </s>
<s>  she says lizzy had better have taken <abvr>
collins </s>
<s>  but i do not think there would have been any fun in it </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s> 
how i should like to be married before any of you </s>
<s>  and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls </s>
<s>  dear me </s>
<s>  we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forsters </s>
<s>  kitty and me were to spend
the day there and <abvr> forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening </s>
<s>  by the bye <abvr> forster and me are such friends </s>
<s>  and so
she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen
was forced to come by herself </s>
<s>  and then what do you think we did </s>
<s>  we
dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady only think what fun </s>
<s>  not a soul knew of it but colonel and <abvr>
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns </s>
<s>  and you cannot imagine how well he looked </s>
<s>  when denny
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they
did not know him in the least </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s>  how i laughed </s>
<s>  and so did <abvr>
forster </s>
<s>  i thought i should have died </s>
<s>  and that made the men suspect
something and then they soon found out what was the matter </s>
<s> 

with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did
lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn </s>
<s>  elizabeth listened as little as she
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name </s>
<s> 

their reception at home was most kind </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty </s>
<s>  and more than once during dinner did <abvr> bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

i am glad you are come back lizzy </s>
<s> 

their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news </s>
<s>  and various were the subjects that
occupied them </s>
<s>  lady lucas was inquiring of maria after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was doubly engaged on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat
some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger
lucases </s>
<s>  and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun </s>
<s> 
as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there
was nobody in the coach </s>
<s>  and i should have gone so all the way if kitty
had not been sick </s>
<s>  and when we got to the george i do think we behaved
very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated
you too </s>
<s>  and then when we came away it was such fun </s>
<s>  i thought we never
should have got into the coach </s>
<s>  i was ready to die of laughter </s>
<s>  and then
we were so merry all the way home </s>
<s>  we talked and laughed so loud that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off </s>
<s> 

to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister
to depreciate such pleasures </s>
<s>  they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds </s>
<s>  but i confess they would have no charms for
mei should infinitely prefer a book </s>
<s> 

but of this answer lydia heard not a word </s>
<s>  she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all </s>
<s> 

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to meryton and to see how everybody went on </s>
<s>  but elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme </s>
<s>  it should not be said that the miss bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers </s>
<s> 
there was another reason too for her opposition </s>
<s>  she dreaded seeing <abvr>
wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible </s>
<s>  the
comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression </s>
<s>  in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account </s>
<s> 

she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under
frequent discussion between her parents </s>
<s>  elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding </s>
<s>  but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome </s>
<s>  and at length resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be
surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between <abvr> darcy and herself </s>
<s> 

miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural </s>
<s>  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings </s>
<s>  she was
sorry that <abvr> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them </s>
<s>  but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him </s>
<s> 

his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly
ought not to have appeared </s>
<s>  but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment </s>
<s> 

indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him </s>
<s>  but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me </s>
<s> 
you do not blame me however for refusing him </s>
<s> 

blame you </s>
<s>  oh no </s>
<s> 

but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham </s>
<s> 

noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did </s>
<s> 

but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next
day </s>
<s> 

she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham </s>
<s>  what a stroke was this for poor jane </s>
<s> 
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual </s>
<s>  nor was darcys vindication though
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery </s>
<s> 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and
seek to clear the one without involving the other </s>
<s> 

this will not do said elizabeth </s>
<s>  you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything </s>
<s>  take your choice but you must be satisfied
with only one </s>
<s>  there is but such a quantity of merit between them </s>
<s>  just
enough to make one good sort of man </s>
<s>  and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much </s>
<s>  for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys </s>
<s> 
but you shall do as you choose </s>
<s> 

it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane </s>
<s> 

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she </s>
<s>  wickham so
very bad </s>
<s>  it is almost past belief </s>
<s>  and poor <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  dear lizzy only
consider what he must have suffered </s>
<s>  such a disappointment </s>
<s>  and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too </s>
<s>  and having to relate such a thing
of his sister </s>
<s>  it is really too distressing </s>
<s>  i am sure you must feel it
so </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both </s>
<s>  i know you will do him such ample justice that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent </s>
<s>  your profusion
makes me saving </s>
<s>  and if you lament over him much longer my heart will
be as light as a feather </s>
<s> 

poor wickham </s>
<s>  there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance </s>
<s>  such an openness and gentleness in his manner </s>
<s> 

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men </s>
<s>  one has got all the goodness and the other all the
appearance of it </s>
<s> 

i never thought <abvr> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
used to do </s>
<s> 

and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him without any reason </s>
<s>  it is such a spur to ones genius such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind </s>
<s>  one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just </s>
<s>  but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty </s>
<s> 

lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now </s>
<s> 

indeed i could not </s>
<s>  i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy </s>
<s>  and
with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say
that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i
had </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  how i wanted you </s>
<s> 

how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to <abvr> darcy for now they do appear wholly
undeserved </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging </s>
<s>  there
is one point on which i want your advice </s>
<s>  i want to be told whether i
ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand
wickhams character </s>
<s> 

miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully </s>
<s>  what is your opinion </s>
<s> 

that it ought not to be attempted </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public </s>
<s>  on the contrary every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself </s>
<s>  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct who will believe me </s>
<s>  the general prejudice against <abvr> darcy
is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light </s>
<s>  i am not equal
to it </s>
<s>  wickham will soon be gone </s>
<s>  and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is </s>
<s>  some time hence it will be all found out
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before </s>
<s>  at
present i will say nothing about it </s>
<s> 

you are quite right </s>
<s>  to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever </s>
<s>  he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to
reestablish a character </s>
<s>  we must not make him desperate </s>
<s> 

the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation </s>
<s>  she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight
and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish
to talk again of either </s>
<s>  but there was still something lurking behind
of which prudence forbade the disclosure </s>
<s>  she dared not relate the other
half of <abvr> darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend </s>
<s>  here was knowledge in which no one
could partake </s>
<s>  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery </s>
<s>  and then said she if that very
improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to
tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself </s>
<s>  the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value </s>
<s> 

she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real
state of her sisters spirits </s>
<s>  jane was not happy </s>
<s>  she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley </s>
<s>  having never even fancied herself
in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment
and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast </s>
<s>  and so fervently did she value his remembrance
and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity </s>
<s> 

well lizzy said <abvr> bennet one day what is your opinion now of
this sad business of janes </s>
<s>  for my part i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody </s>
<s>  i told my sister phillips so the other day </s>
<s>  but
i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london </s>
<s>  well he is
a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now </s>
<s>  there is no talk of
his coming to netherfield again in the summer </s>
<s>  and i have inquired of
everybody too who is likely to know </s>
<s> 

i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more </s>
<s> 

oh well </s>
<s>  it is just as he chooses </s>
<s>  nobody wants him to come </s>
<s>  though i
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill </s>
<s>  and if i was her i
would not have put up with it </s>
<s>  well my comfort is i am sure jane will
die of a broken heart </s>
<s>  and then he will be sorry for what he has done </s>
<s> 

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation
she made no answer </s>
<s> 

well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the
collinses live very comfortable do they </s>
<s>  well well i only hope
it will last </s>
<s>  and what sort of table do they keep </s>
<s>  charlotte is an
excellent manager i dare say </s>
<s>  if she is half as sharp as her
mother she is saving enough </s>
<s>  there is nothing extravagant in their
housekeeping i dare say </s>
<s> 

no nothing at all </s>
<s> 

a great deal of good management depend upon it </s>
<s>  yes yes they will
take care not to outrun their income </s>
<s>  they will never be distressed
for money </s>
<s>  well much good may it do them </s>
<s>  and so i suppose they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead </s>
<s>  they look upon it as
quite their own i dare say whenever that happens </s>
<s> 

it was a subject which they could not mention before me </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  it would have been strange if they had </s>
<s>  but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves </s>
<s>  well if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better </s>
<s>  i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me </s>
<s> 



chapter 


the first week of their return was soon gone </s>
<s>  the second began </s>
<s>  it was
the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace </s>
<s>  the dejection was almost
universal </s>
<s>  the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink
and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments </s>
<s>  very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such
hardheartedness in any of the family </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>  what is to become of us </s>
<s>  what are we to do </s>
<s>  would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe </s>
<s>  how can you be smiling so
lizzy </s>
<s> 

their affectionate mother shared all their grief </s>
<s>  she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years
ago </s>
<s> 

i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel
millers regiment went away </s>
<s>  i thought i should have broken my heart </s>
<s> 

i am sure i shall break mine said lydia </s>
<s> 

if one could but go to brighton </s>
<s>  observed <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> if one could but go to brighton </s>
<s>  but papa is so
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

a little seabathing would set me up forever </s>
<s> 

and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
 added kitty </s>
<s> 

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house </s>
<s>  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them </s>
<s>  but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame </s>
<s>  she felt anew the justice of <abvr> darcys
objections </s>
<s>  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend </s>
<s> 

but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away </s>
<s>  for she
received an invitation from <abvr> forster the wife of the colonel of
the regiment to accompany her to brighton </s>
<s>  this invaluable friend was a
very young woman and very lately married </s>
<s>  a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two </s>
<s> 

the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of <abvr> forster
the delight of <abvr> bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely
to be described </s>
<s>  wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever </s>
<s> 
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish </s>
<s> 

i cannot see why <abvr> forster should not ask me as well as lydia
 said she though i am not her particular friend </s>
<s>  i have just as much
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older </s>
<s> 

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make
her resigned </s>
<s>  as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter </s>
<s>  and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go </s>
<s>  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as <abvr> forster and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must
be greater than at home </s>
<s>  he heard her attentively and then said </s>
<s> 

lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances </s>
<s> 

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and
imprudent mannernay which has already arisen from it i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair </s>
<s> 

already arisen </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  what has she frightened away
some of your lovers </s>
<s>  poor little lizzy </s>
<s>  but do not be cast down </s>
<s>  such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret </s>
<s>  come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by lydias folly </s>
<s> 

indeed you are mistaken </s>
<s>  i have no such injuries to resent </s>
<s>  it is not
of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining </s>
<s>  our
importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydias character </s>
<s>  excuse me for i must speak plainly </s>
<s>  if you my dear
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment </s>
<s>  her character
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous </s>
<s>  a flirt too in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation </s>
<s>  without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person </s>
<s>  and from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite </s>
<s>  in this danger
kitty also is comprehended </s>
<s>  she will follow wherever lydia leads </s>
<s>  vain
ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  my dear father can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply </s>
<s> 

do not make yourself uneasy my love </s>
<s>  wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued </s>
<s>  and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly
sisters </s>
<s>  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton </s>
<s>  let her go then </s>
<s>  colonel forster is a sensible man and will
keep her out of any real mischief </s>
<s>  and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody </s>
<s>  at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here </s>
<s>  the officers will find
women better worth their notice </s>
<s>  let us hope therefore that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance </s>
<s>  at any rate she cannot grow
many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life </s>
<s> 

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content </s>
<s>  but her own opinion
continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry </s>
<s>  it was not
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them </s>
<s>  she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret
over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her
disposition </s>
<s> 

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility </s>
<s>  in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness </s>
<s>  she saw with the creative eye
of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers </s>
<s> 
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown </s>
<s>  she saw all the glories of the campits tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young
and the gay and dazzling with scarlet </s>
<s>  and to complete the view she
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once </s>
<s> 

had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these what would have been her sensations </s>
<s>  they could have
been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same </s>
<s> 
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself </s>
<s> 

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed </s>
<s>  and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving
home </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was now to see <abvr> wickham for the last time </s>
<s>  having been
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty
well over </s>
<s>  the agitations of former partiality entirely so </s>
<s>  she had even
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary </s>
<s>  in his present
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after
what had since passed to provoke her </s>
<s>  she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry </s>
<s>  and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal </s>
<s> 

on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined
with other of the officers at longbourn </s>
<s>  and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and <abvr> darcys having both spent three
weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former </s>
<s> 

he looked surprised displeased alarmed </s>
<s>  but with a moments
recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen
him often </s>
<s>  and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man
asked her how she had liked him </s>
<s>  her answer was warmly in his favour </s>
<s> 
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added </s>
<s> 

how long did you say he was at rosings </s>
<s> 

nearly three weeks </s>
<s> 

and you saw him frequently </s>
<s> 

yes almost every day </s>
<s> 

his manners are very different from his cousins </s>
<s> 

yes very different </s>
<s>  but i think <abvr> darcy improves upon acquaintance </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> wickham with a look which did not escape her </s>
<s>  and
pray may i ask </s>
<s>  but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is
it in address that he improves </s>
<s>  has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style </s>
<s> for i dare not hope he continued in a lower
and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  said elizabeth </s>
<s>  in essentials i believe he is very much
what he ever was </s>
<s> 

while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning </s>
<s>  there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention while she added </s>
<s> 

when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from
knowing him better his disposition was better understood </s>
<s> 

wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look </s>
<s>  for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his
embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of
accents </s>
<s> 

you who so well know my feeling towards <abvr> darcy will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right </s>
<s>  his pride in that direction
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by </s>
<s>  i only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been
alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe </s>
<s>  his fear of her has always
operated i know when they were together </s>
<s>  and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i
am certain he has very much at heart </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head </s>
<s>  she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge
him </s>
<s>  the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his
side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth </s>
<s>  and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again </s>
<s> 

when the party broke up lydia returned with <abvr> forster to meryton
from whence they were to set out early the next morning </s>
<s>  the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic </s>
<s>  kitty was the
only one who shed tears </s>
<s>  but she did weep from vexation and envy </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to </s>
<s>  and in
the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard </s>
<s> 



chapter 


had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort </s>
<s>  her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her </s>
<s>  respect
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever </s>
<s>  and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice </s>
<s>  he was fond of
the country and of books </s>
<s>  and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments </s>
<s>  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement </s>
<s>  this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife </s>
<s>  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given </s>
<s> 

elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her
fathers behaviour as a husband </s>
<s>  she had always seen it with pain </s>
<s>  but
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children was so highly reprehensible </s>
<s>  but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so illjudged a direction of talents </s>
<s>  talents which rightly used
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife </s>
<s> 

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment </s>
<s>  their parties
abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle </s>
<s>  and though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
wateringplace and a camp </s>
<s>  upon the whole therefore she found what
has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself </s>
<s>  it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the
present and prepare for another disappointment </s>
<s>  her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts </s>
<s>  it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable </s>
<s>  and could she have included jane in the
scheme every part of it would have been perfect </s>
<s> 

but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for </s>
<s> 
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain </s>
<s> 
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised </s>
<s>  a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful </s>
<s>  and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation </s>
<s> 

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty </s>
<s>  but her letters were always long expected and
always very short </s>
<s>  those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers
had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild </s>
<s>  that she had a new gown or a new parasol which
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry as <abvr> forster called her and they were going off to
the camp </s>
<s>  and from her correspondence with her sister there was still
less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public </s>
<s> 

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good
humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn </s>
<s>  everything wore
a happier aspect </s>
<s>  the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity </s>
<s>  and by the middle of
june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears </s>
<s>  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in
meryton </s>
<s> 

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter
arrived from <abvr> gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the
present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire </s>
<s>  in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks </s>
<s>  and to <abvr> gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction </s>
<s>  the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where
they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth
dovedale or the peak </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was excessively disappointed </s>
<s>  she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough </s>
<s>  but it
was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy </s>
<s> 
and all was soon right again </s>
<s> 

with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected </s>
<s>  it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner </s>
<s>  but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me </s>
<s> 

the period of expectation was now doubled </s>
<s>  four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunts arrival </s>
<s>  but they did pass away and <abvr>
and <abvr> gardiner with their four children did at length appear at
longbourn </s>
<s>  the children two girls of six and eight years old and two
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
wayteaching them playing with them and loving them </s>
<s> 

the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the
next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement </s>
<s> 
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions </s>
<s> 
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection

disappointments abroad </s>
<s> 

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay </s>

sufficiently known </s>
<s>  a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern </s>
<s>  to the little town of lambton the scene of <abvr> gardiners
former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country </s>
<s>  and within five miles of lambton
elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated </s>
<s>  it was not
in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it </s>
<s>  in
talking over their route the evening before <abvr> gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner declared his
willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation </s>
<s> 

my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much </s>
<s>  said her aunt </s>
<s>  a place too with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected </s>
<s>  wickham passed all his youth there you
know </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was distressed </s>
<s>  she felt that she had no business at
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it </s>
<s>  she
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses </s>
<s>  after going over so
many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner abused her stupidity </s>
<s>  if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself </s>
<s>  but
the grounds are delightful </s>
<s>  they have some of the finest woods in the
country </s>
<s> 

elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce </s>
<s>  the
possibility of meeting <abvr> darcy while viewing the place instantly
occurred </s>
<s>  it would be dreadful </s>
<s>  she blushed at the very idea and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk </s>
<s>  but against this there were objections </s>
<s>  and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered </s>
<s> 

accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place </s>
<s>  what was the name of its
proprietor </s>
<s>  and with no little alarm whether the family were down for
the summer </s>
<s>  a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her
alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself </s>
<s>  and when the subject was revived the
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme </s>
<s>  to pemberley therefore they were to go </s>

chapter 


elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation </s>
<s>  and when at length they turned
in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter </s>
<s> 

the park was very large and contained great variety of ground </s>
<s>  they
entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent </s>
<s> 

elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view </s>
<s>  they gradually ascended for
halfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which
the road with some abruptness wound </s>
<s>  it was a large handsome stone
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills </s>
<s>  and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance </s>
<s>  its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned </s>
<s>  elizabeth was delighted </s>
<s>  she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste </s>
<s>  they were
all of them warm in their admiration </s>
<s>  and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something </s>
<s> 

they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door </s>
<s>  and
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned </s>
<s>  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken </s>
<s>  on applying to see the place they were admitted into the
hall </s>
<s>  and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was </s>
<s> 

the housekeeper came </s>
<s>  a respectablelooking elderly woman much less
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her </s>
<s>  they
followed her into the diningparlour </s>
<s>  it was a large well proportioned
room handsomely fitted up </s>
<s>  elizabeth after slightly surveying it went
to a window to enjoy its prospect </s>
<s>  the hill crowned with wood which
they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance
was a beautiful object </s>
<s>  every disposition of the ground was good </s>
<s>  and
she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it
with delight </s>
<s>  as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions </s>
<s>  but from every window there were beauties to be
seen </s>
<s>  the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor </s>
<s>  but elizabeth saw with admiration of
his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine </s>
<s>  with less of
splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings </s>
<s> 

and of this place thought she i might have been mistress </s>
<s>  with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted </s>
<s>  instead of
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  but norecollecting
herselfthat could never be </s>
<s>  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me </s>
<s>  i should not have been allowed to invite them </s>
<s> 

this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like
regret </s>
<s> 

she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent but had not the courage for it </s>
<s>  at length however the question
was asked by her uncle </s>
<s>  and she turned away with alarm while <abvr>
reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with
a large party of friends </s>
<s>  how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day </s>
<s> 

her aunt now called her to look at a picture </s>
<s>  she approached and saw the
likeness of <abvr> wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures
over the mantelpiece </s>
<s>  her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it </s>
<s> 
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought
up by him at his own expense </s>
<s>  he is now gone into the army she added </s>
<s> 
but i am afraid he has turned out very wild </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not
return it </s>
<s> 

and that said <abvr> reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures
is my masterand very like him </s>
<s>  it was drawn at the same time as the
otherabout eight years ago </s>
<s> 

i have heard much of your masters fine person said <abvr> gardiner
looking at the picture </s>
<s>  it is a handsome face </s>
<s>  but lizzy you can tell
us whether it is like or not </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master </s>
<s> 

does that young lady know <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

elizabeth coloured and said </s>
<s>  a little </s>
<s> 

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam </s>
<s> 

yes very handsome </s>
<s> 

i am sure i know none so handsome </s>
<s>  but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer larger picture of him than this </s>
<s>  this room was my late
masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then </s>
<s>  he was very fond of them </s>
<s> 

this accounted to elizabeth for <abvr> wickhams being among them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn
when she was only eight years old </s>
<s> 

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother </s>
<s>  said <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen </s>
<s>  and so
accomplished </s>
<s> she plays and sings all day long </s>
<s>  in the next room is
a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master </s>
<s>  she
comes here tomorrow with him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks </s>
<s>  <abvr> reynolds either
by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister </s>
<s> 

is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year </s>
<s> 

not so much as i could wish sir </s>
<s>  but i dare say he may spend half his
time here </s>
<s>  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months </s>
<s> 

except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate </s>
<s> 

if your master would marry you might see more of him </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>
<s>  but i do not know when that will be </s>
<s>  i do not know who is
good enough for him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gardiner smiled </s>
<s>  elizabeth could not help saying it is
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so </s>
<s> 

i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him
 replied the other </s>
<s>  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far </s>
<s>  and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have
never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever
since he was four years old </s>
<s> 

this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her
ideas </s>
<s>  that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion </s>
<s> 
her keenest attention was awakened </s>
<s>  she longed to hear more and was
grateful to her uncle for saying </s>
<s> 

there are very few people of whom so much can be said </s>
<s>  you are lucky in
having such a master </s>
<s> 

yes sir i know i am </s>
<s>  if i were to go through the world i could
not meet with a better </s>
<s>  but i have always observed that they who are
goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up </s>
<s>  and
he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the
world </s>
<s> 

elizabeth almost stared at her </s>
<s>  can this be <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  thought she </s>
<s> 

his father was an excellent man said <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s> 

yes maam that he was indeed </s>
<s>  and his son will be just like himjust
as affable to the poor </s>
<s> 

elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more </s>
<s>  <abvr>
reynolds could interest her on no other point </s>
<s>  she related the subjects
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the
furniture in vain </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master soon led again to the subject </s>
<s>  and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase </s>
<s> 

he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever
lived </s>
<s>  not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but
themselves </s>
<s>  there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name </s>
<s>  some people call him proud </s>
<s>  but i am sure i never saw
anything of it </s>
<s>  to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men </s>
<s> 

in what an amiable light does this place him </s>
<s>  thought elizabeth </s>
<s> 

this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend </s>
<s> 

perhaps we might be deceived </s>
<s> 

that is not very likely </s>
<s>  our authority was too good </s>
<s> 

on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below </s>
<s>  and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when
last at pemberley </s>
<s> 

he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards
one of the windows </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter
the room </s>
<s>  and this is always the way with him she added </s>
<s>  whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment </s>
<s>  there
is nothing he would not do for her </s>
<s> 

the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were
all that remained to be shown </s>
<s>  in the former were many good paintings </s>
<s> 
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art </s>
<s>  and from such as had been already
visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and
also more intelligible </s>
<s> 

in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger </s>
<s>  elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her </s>
<s>  at last it arrested
herand she beheld a striking resemblance to <abvr> darcy with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her </s>
<s>  she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest
contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers
lifetime </s>
<s> 

there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance </s>
<s>  the commendation bestowed on him by <abvr> reynolds
was of no trifling nature </s>
<s>  what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant </s>
<s>  as a brother a landlord a master she
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship </s>
<s> how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow </s>
<s> how much of
good or evil must be done by him </s>
<s>  every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his
eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before </s>
<s>  she remembered its warmth and
softened its impropriety of expression </s>
<s> 

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen
they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were
consigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor </s>
<s> 

as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back
to look again </s>
<s>  her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables </s>
<s> 

they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight </s>
<s>  their eyes
instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush </s>
<s>  he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise </s>
<s>  but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party
and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least
of perfect civility </s>
<s> 

she had instinctively turned away </s>
<s>  but stopping on his approach
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome </s>
<s>  had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw <abvr> darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on
beholding his master must immediately have told it </s>
<s>  they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family </s>
<s>  amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment </s>
<s>  and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life </s>
<s>  nor did he seem much more at ease </s>
<s>  when he spoke his accent
had none of its usual sedateness </s>
<s>  and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed in
derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts </s>
<s> 

at length every idea seemed to fail him </s>
<s>  and after standing a few
moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took
leave </s>
<s> 

the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure </s>
<s>  but
elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings
followed them in silence </s>
<s>  she was overpowered by shame and vexation </s>
<s>  her
coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the
world </s>
<s>  how strange it must appear to him </s>
<s>  in what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man </s>
<s>  it might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  why did she come </s>
<s>  or why did he
thus come a day before he was expected </s>
<s>  had they been only ten minutes
sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination </s>
<s> 
for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage </s>
<s>  she blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting </s>
<s>  and his behaviour so strikingly
alteredwhat could it mean </s>
<s>  that he should even speak to her was
amazing </s>
<s> but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family </s>
<s> 
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting </s>
<s>  what
a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put
his letter into her hand </s>
<s>  she knew not what to think or how to account
for it </s>
<s> 

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching </s>
<s>  but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it </s>
<s>  and though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she
distinguished no part of the scene </s>
<s>  her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where <abvr> darcy then
was </s>
<s>  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything
she was still dear to him </s>
<s>  perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease </s>
<s>  yet there had been that in his voice which was
not like ease </s>
<s>  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with
composure </s>
<s> 

at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself </s>
<s> 

they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while
ascended some of the higher grounds </s>
<s>  when in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the
valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading
many and occasionally part of the stream </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk </s>
<s> 
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round </s>
<s> 
it settled the matter </s>
<s>  and they pursued the accustomed circuit </s>
<s>  which
brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods
to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts </s>
<s>  they crossed
it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene </s>
<s> 
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited </s>
<s>  and the
valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it </s>
<s> 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings </s>
<s>  but when they had crossed the
bridge and perceived their distance from the house <abvr> gardiner
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible </s>
<s>  her niece was
therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction </s>
<s>  but their
progress was slow for <abvr> gardiner though seldom able to indulge the
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the
man about them that he advanced but little </s>
<s>  whilst wandering on in this
slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of <abvr> darcy
approaching them and at no great distance </s>
<s>  the walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before
they met </s>
<s>  elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared
for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness if he really intended to meet them </s>
<s>  for a few moments indeed
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path </s>
<s>  the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view </s>
<s>  the
turning past he was immediately before them </s>
<s>  with a glance she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility </s>
<s>  and to imitate his
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place </s>
<s> 
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when
some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed </s>
<s>  her colour changed
and she said no more </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner was standing a little behind </s>
<s>  and on her pausing he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends </s>
<s> 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared </s>
<s> 
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself </s>
<s>  what will be his surprise thought
she when he knows who they are </s>
<s>  he takes them now for people of
fashion </s>
<s> 

the introduction however was immediately made </s>
<s>  and as she named their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions </s>
<s>  that he was surprised by the
connection was evident </s>
<s>  he sustained it however with fortitude and
so far from going away turned back with them and entered into
conversation with <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  elizabeth could not but be pleased
could not but triumph </s>
<s>  it was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush </s>
<s>  she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence
his taste or his good manners </s>
<s> 

the conversation soon turned upon fishing </s>
<s>  and she heard <abvr> darcy
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner who was
walking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder </s>
<s> 
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly </s>
<s>  the compliment
must be all for herself </s>
<s>  her astonishment however was extreme and
continually was she repeating why is he so altered </s>
<s>  from what can
it proceed </s>
<s>  it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that his
manners are thus softened </s>
<s>  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a
change as this </s>
<s>  it is impossible that he should still love me </s>
<s> 

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration </s>
<s>  it originated
in <abvr> gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found
elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred
her husbands </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on
together </s>
<s>  after a short silence the lady first spoke </s>
<s>  she wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that
you would certainly not be here till tomorrow </s>
<s>  and indeed before we
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country </s>
<s>  he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling </s>
<s>  they
will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with youmr </s>
<s>  bingley and his sisters </s>
<s> 

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow </s>
<s>  her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when <abvr> bingleys name had been the last
mentioned between them </s>
<s>  and if she might judge by his complexion his
mind was not very differently engaged </s>
<s> 

there is also one other person in the party he continued after a
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you </s>
<s>  will you allow
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton </s>
<s> 

the surprise of such an application was great indeed </s>
<s>  it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it </s>
<s>  she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was
satisfactory </s>
<s>  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her </s>
<s> 

they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought </s>
<s>  elizabeth
was not comfortable </s>
<s>  that was impossible </s>
<s>  but she was flattered and
pleased </s>
<s>  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind </s>
<s>  they soon outstripped the others and when they had
reached the carriage <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind </s>
<s> 

he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not
tired and they stood together on the lawn </s>
<s>  at such a time much might
have been said and silence was very awkward </s>
<s>  she wanted to talk but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject </s>
<s>  at last she recollected
that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale
with great perseverance </s>
<s>  yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete was
over </s>
<s>  on <abvr> and <abvr> gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment </s>
<s>  but this was declined and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage </s>
<s>  and when it drove off elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house </s>
<s> 

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began </s>
<s>  and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected </s>
<s> 
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle </s>
<s> 

there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming </s>
<s>  i can now
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i
have seen nothing of it </s>
<s> 

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us </s>
<s>  it was more
than civil </s>
<s>  it was really attentive </s>
<s>  and there was no necessity for such
attention </s>
<s>  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling </s>
<s> 

to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham </s>
<s> 
or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features
are perfectly good </s>
<s>  but how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could </s>
<s>  said that she had liked
him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning </s>
<s> 

but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied
her uncle </s>
<s>  your great men often are </s>
<s>  and therefore i shall not take him
at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off
his grounds </s>
<s> 

elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but
said nothing </s>
<s> 

from what we have seen of him continued <abvr> gardiner i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham </s>
<s>  he has not an illnatured look </s>
<s> 
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks </s>
<s>  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart </s>
<s>  but to be sure the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character </s>
<s> 
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes </s>
<s>  but he is a liberal
master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue </s>
<s> 

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham </s>
<s>  and therefore gave them to understand in
as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from
his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different
construction </s>
<s>  and that his character was by no means so faulty nor
wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  in
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner was surprised and concerned </s>
<s>  but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection </s>
<s>  and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else </s>
<s>  fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance </s>
<s> 

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends </s>
<s>  and she could do nothing
but think and think with wonder of <abvr> darcys civility and above
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth had settled it that <abvr> darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley </s>
<s>  and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning </s>
<s> 
but her conclusion was false </s>
<s>  for on the very morning after their
arrival at lambton these visitors came </s>
<s>  they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street </s>
<s>  elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected </s>
<s>  her uncle and aunt were all amazement </s>
<s>  and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on
the business </s>
<s>  nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece </s>
<s>  while these
newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of
elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing </s>
<s>  she was quite
amazed at her own discomposure </s>
<s>  but amongst other causes of disquiet
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour </s>
<s>  and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her </s>
<s> 

she retreated from the window fearful of being seen </s>
<s>  and as she walked
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse </s>
<s> 

miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction
took place </s>
<s>  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself </s>
<s>  since her
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud </s>
<s> 
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy </s>
<s>  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable </s>
<s> 

miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth </s>
<s>  and though
little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance
womanly and graceful </s>
<s>  she was less handsome than her brother </s>
<s>  but there
was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle </s>
<s>  elizabeth who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <abvr> darcy had been was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings </s>
<s> 

they had not long been together before <abvr> darcy told her that bingley
was also coming to wait on her </s>
<s>  and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick
step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room </s>
<s>  all
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away </s>
<s>  but had she still
felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again </s>
<s>  he
inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked
and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself </s>
<s>  they had long wished to see him </s>
<s>  the whole party before
them indeed excited a lively attention </s>
<s>  the suspicions which had just
arisen of <abvr> darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry </s>
<s>  and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love </s>
<s>  of the ladys sensations they remained a little
in doubt </s>
<s>  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough </s>
<s> 

elizabeth on her side had much to do </s>
<s>  she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors </s>
<s>  she wanted to compose her own and
to make herself agreeable to all </s>
<s>  and in the latter object where she
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour </s>
<s>  bingley
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased </s>
<s> 

in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister </s>
<s>  and oh </s>
<s> 
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner </s>
<s>  sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance </s>
<s>  but
though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane </s>
<s>  no look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard </s>
<s>  nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister </s>
<s>  on this point
she was soon satisfied </s>
<s>  and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a
recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared </s>
<s>  he observed
to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone
which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her </s>
<s>  and before she could reply
he added it is above eight months </s>
<s>  we have not met since the th of
november when we were all dancing together at netherfield </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact </s>
<s>  and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether
all her sisters were at longbourn </s>
<s>  there was not much in the question
nor in the preceding remark </s>
<s>  but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning </s>
<s> 

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on <abvr> darcy himself </s>
<s> 
but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day </s>
<s>  when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change was
so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible </s>
<s>  never even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations
at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from
selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings </s>
<s> 

their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour </s>
<s>  and when they arose
to depart <abvr> darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner and miss bennet to dinner
at pemberley before they left the country </s>
<s>  miss darcy though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations
readily obeyed </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its
acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head </s>
<s>  presuming however
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of
society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on </s>
<s> 

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends </s>
<s>  elizabeth construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on
this account as well as some others found herself when their
visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little </s>
<s>  eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress </s>
<s> 

but she had no reason to fear <abvr> and <abvr> gardiners curiosity </s>
<s>  it was
not their wish to force her communication </s>
<s>  it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with <abvr> darcy than they had before any idea of </s>
<s> 
it was evident that he was very much in love with her </s>
<s>  they saw much to
interest but nothing to justify inquiry </s>
<s> 

of <abvr> darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well </s>
<s>  and as far
as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find </s>
<s>  they could
not be untouched by his politeness </s>
<s>  and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  there was now an interest
however in believing the housekeeper </s>
<s>  and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be
hastily rejected </s>
<s>  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight </s>
<s>  they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride </s>
<s>  pride he probably had and if not
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown
where the family did not visit </s>
<s>  it was acknowledged however that he
was a liberal man and did much good among the poor </s>
<s> 

with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation </s>
<s>  for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind
him which <abvr> darcy afterwards discharged </s>
<s> 

as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last </s>
<s>  and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion </s>
<s> 
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out </s>
<s>  she
certainly did not hate him </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  hatred had vanished long ago and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him
that could be so called </s>
<s>  the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling </s>
<s>  and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in
his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light
which yesterday had produced </s>
<s>  but above all above respect and esteem
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked </s>
<s> 
it was gratitude </s>
<s>  gratitude not merely for having once loved her
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection </s>
<s>  he who she had been persuaded would avoid
her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most
eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display
of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only
were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent
on making her known to his sister </s>
<s>  such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent
love it must be attributed </s>
<s>  and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be
exactly defined </s>
<s>  she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him
she felt a real interest in his welfare </s>
<s>  and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her
fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses </s>
<s> 

it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled
by some exertion of politeness on their side </s>
<s>  and consequently that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning </s>
<s>  they were therefore to go </s>
<s>  elizabeth was pleased </s>
<s>  though when
she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply </s>

renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon </s>

originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how

however did her justice and pitied her </s>
<s> 

by <abvr> hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey </s>
<s>  and
on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be
succeeded for a few moments </s>
<s>  it was first broken by <abvr> annesley a
genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the
others </s>
<s>  and between her and <abvr> gardiner with occasional help from
elizabeth the conversation was carried on </s>
<s>  miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it </s>
<s>  and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard </s>
<s> 

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without
calling her attention </s>
<s>  this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance </s>
<s>  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much </s>
<s>  her own thoughts were employing her </s>
<s>  she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room </s>
<s>  she wished she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them </s>
<s>  and whether
she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine </s>
<s>  after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss
bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family </s>
<s>  she answered with equal
indifference and brevity and the other said no more </s>
<s> 

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season </s>
<s>  but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from <abvr> annesley to miss darcy had been
given to remind her of her post </s>
<s>  there was now employment for the whole
partyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat </s>
<s>  and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected
them round the table </s>
<s> 

while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of <abvr> darcy by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room </s>
<s>  and then though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to
regret that he came </s>
<s> 

he had been some time with <abvr> gardiner who with two or three other
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning </s>
<s>  no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed </s>
<s>  a resolution the more
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room </s>
<s>  in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects </s>
<s>  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions
to <abvr> darcy were by no means over </s>
<s>  miss darcy on her brothers
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side </s>
<s>  miss
bingley saw all this likewise </s>
<s>  and in the imprudence of anger took the
first opportunity of saying with sneering civility </s>
<s> 

pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton </s>
<s> 
they must be a great loss to your family </s>
<s> 

in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name </s>
<s>  but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts </s>
<s>  and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress </s>
<s> 
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone </s>
<s>  while
she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened
complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes </s>
<s>  had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint </s>
<s>  but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps </s>
<s>  not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys
meditated elopement </s>
<s>  to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy
was possible except to elizabeth </s>
<s>  and from all bingleys connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very
wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming
hereafter her own </s>
<s>  he had certainly formed such a plan and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend </s>
<s> 

elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion </s>
<s>  and
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to
wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able
to speak any more </s>
<s>  her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully </s>
<s> 

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned </s>
<s>  and while <abvr> darcy was attending them to their carriage miss
bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person
behaviour and dress </s>
<s>  but georgiana would not join her </s>
<s>  her brothers
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour </s>
<s>  his judgement could not
err </s>
<s>  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable </s>
<s>  when
darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister </s>
<s> 

how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning <abvr> darcy she
cried </s>
<s>  i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter </s>
<s>  she is grown so brown and coarse </s>
<s>  louisa and i were agreeing
that we should not have known her again </s>
<s> 

however little <abvr> darcy might have liked such an address he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer </s>
<s> 

for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could
see any beauty in her </s>
<s>  her face is too thin </s>
<s>  her complexion has no
brilliancy </s>
<s>  and her features are not at all handsome </s>
<s>  her nose
wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines </s>
<s>  her teeth are
tolerable but not out of the common way </s>
<s>  and as for her eyes
which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything
extraordinary in them </s>
<s>  they have a sharp shrewish look which i do
not like at all </s>
<s>  and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency
without fashion which is intolerable </s>
<s> 

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not
the best method of recommending herself </s>
<s>  but angry people are not always
wise </s>
<s>  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the
success she expected </s>
<s>  he was resolutely silent however and from a
determination of making him speak she continued </s>
<s> 

i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty </s>
<s>  and i particularly recollect
your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield �she
a beauty </s>
<s> i should as soon call her mother a wit </s>
<s>  but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time </s>
<s> 

yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that
was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance </s>
<s> 

he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them
both </s>
<s>  the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention </s>
<s>  they talked
of his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything but
himself </s>
<s>  yet elizabeth was longing to know what <abvr> gardiner thought of
him and <abvr> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces
beginning the subject </s>

chapter 


elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton </s>
<s>  and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there </s>
<s>  but
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere </s>
<s>  elizabeth was not surprised at it as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill </s>
<s> 

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in </s>
<s>  and
her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by
themselves </s>
<s>  the one missent must first be attended to </s>
<s>  it had been
written five days ago </s>
<s>  the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded </s>
<s> 
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident
agitation gave more important intelligence </s>
<s>  it was to this effect </s>
<s> 

since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature </s>
<s>  but i am afraid of alarming yoube
assured that we are all well </s>
<s>  what i have to say relates to poor lydia </s>
<s> 
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed
from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers </s>
<s>  to own the truth with wickham </s>
<s>  imagine our
surprise </s>
<s>  to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected </s>
<s>  i am
very very sorry </s>
<s>  so imprudent a match on both sides </s>
<s>  but i am willing
to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood </s>
<s> 
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step
and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart </s>
<s>  his choice is
disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing </s>
<s> 
our poor mother is sadly grieved </s>
<s>  my father bears it better </s>
<s>  how
thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against
him </s>
<s>  we must forget it ourselves </s>
<s>  they were off saturday night about
twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight </s>
<s>  the express was sent off directly </s>
<s>  my dear lizzy they must have
passed within ten miles of us </s>
<s>  colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon </s>
<s>  lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of
their intention </s>
<s>  i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor
mother </s>
<s>  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly
know what i have written </s>
<s> 

without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing
what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows </s>
<s>  it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first </s>
<s> 

by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter </s>
<s>  i
wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my
head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent </s>
<s>  dearest
lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you
and it cannot be delayed </s>
<s>  imprudent as the marriage between <abvr> wickham
and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland </s>
<s>  colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the
day before not many hours after the express </s>
<s>  though lydias short
letter to <abvr> f </s>
<s>  gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w </s>
<s> 
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was
repeated to colonel f </s>
<s>  who instantly taking the alarm set off from b </s>
<s> 
intending to trace their route </s>
<s>  he did trace them easily to clapham
but no further </s>
<s>  for on entering that place they removed into a hackney
coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom </s>
<s>  all that
is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road </s>
<s> 
i know not what to think </s>
<s>  after making every possible inquiry on that
side london colonel f </s>
<s>  came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but
without any successno such people had been seen to pass through </s>
<s>  with
the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart </s>
<s>  i am sincerely grieved
for him and <abvr> f </s>
<s>  but no one can throw any blame on them </s>
<s>  our
distress my dear lizzy is very great </s>
<s>  my father and mother believe the
worst but i cannot think so ill of him </s>
<s>  many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan </s>
<s>  and even if he could form such a design against a
young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose
her so lost to everything </s>
<s>  impossible </s>
<s>  i grieve to find however that
colonel f </s>
<s>  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage </s>
<s>  he shook his
head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w </s>
<s>  was not a man to
be trusted </s>
<s>  my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room </s>
<s>  could she
exert herself it would be better </s>
<s>  but this is not to be expected </s>
<s>  and
as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected </s>
<s>  poor kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment </s>
<s>  but as it was a matter of
confidence one cannot wonder </s>
<s>  i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes </s>
<s>  but now as the
first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return </s>
<s>  i am not
so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient </s>
<s>  adieu </s>
<s>  i
take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not </s>
<s>  but
circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible </s>
<s>  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well
that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something
more to ask of the former </s>
<s>  my father is going to london with colonel
forster instantly to try to discover her </s>
<s>  what he means to do i am sure
i know not </s>
<s>  but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to
be at brighton again tomorrow evening </s>
<s>  in such an exigence my
uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world </s>
<s>  he will
immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  where where is my uncle </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth darting from her seat
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing
a moment of the time so precious </s>
<s>  but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant and <abvr> darcy appeared </s>
<s>  her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak
she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation
hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you </s>
<s>  i must find
mr </s>
<s>  gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed </s>
<s>  i have not
an instant to lose </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  what is the matter </s>
<s>  cried he with more feeling than
politeness </s>
<s>  then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute </s>
<s> 
but let me or let the servant go after <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  you are
not well enough </s>
<s>  you cannot go yourself </s>
<s> 

elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them </s>
<s>  calling back
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly </s>
<s> 

on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her
or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration
let me call your maid </s>
<s>  is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief </s>
<s>  a glass of wine </s>
<s>  shall i get you one </s>
<s>  you are very ill </s>
<s> 

no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself </s>
<s>  there
is nothing the matter with me </s>
<s>  i am quite well </s>
<s>  i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn </s>
<s> 

she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could
not speak another word </s>
<s>  darcy in wretched suspense could only say
something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate
silence </s>
<s>  at length she spoke again </s>
<s>  i have just had a letter from jane
with such dreadful news </s>
<s>  it cannot be concealed from anyone </s>
<s>  my younger
sister has left all her friendshas eloped </s>
<s>  has thrown herself into
the power ofof <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  they are gone off together from brighton </s>
<s> 
you know him too well to doubt the rest </s>
<s>  she has no money no
connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever </s>
<s> 

darcy was fixed in astonishment </s>
<s>  when i consider she added in a yet
more agitated voice that i might have prevented it </s>
<s>  i who knew what
he was </s>
<s>  had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i
learnt to my own family </s>
<s>  had his character been known this could not
have happened </s>
<s>  but it is allall too late now </s>
<s> 

i am grieved indeed cried darcy </s>
<s>  grievedshocked </s>
<s>  but is it
certainabsolutely certain </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced
almost to london but not beyond </s>
<s>  they are certainly not gone to
scotland </s>
<s> 

and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her </s>
<s> 

my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles
immediate assistance </s>
<s>  and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour </s>
<s>  but
nothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done </s>
<s>  how is
such a man to be worked on </s>
<s>  how are they even to be discovered </s>
<s>  i have
not the smallest hope </s>
<s>  it is every way horrible </s>
<s> 

darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence </s>
<s> 

when my eyes were opened to his real characteroh </s>
<s>  had i known what
i ought what i dared to do </s>
<s>  but i knew noti was afraid of doing too
much </s>
<s>  wretched wretched mistake </s>
<s> 

darcy made no answer </s>
<s>  he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air
gloomy </s>
<s>  elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it </s>
<s>  her
power was sinking </s>
<s>  everything must sink under such a proof of family
weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace </s>
<s>  she could neither
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress </s>
<s>  it
was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes </s>
<s>  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him as now when all love must be vain </s>
<s> 

but self though it would intrude could not engross her </s>
<s>  lydiathe
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed
up every private care </s>
<s>  and covering her face with her handkerchief
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else </s>
<s>  and after a pause of
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my
stay but real though unavailing concern </s>
<s>  would to heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress </s>
<s>  but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks </s>
<s>  this unfortunate affair will i
fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley
today </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy </s>
<s>  say that
urgent business calls us home immediately </s>
<s>  conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible i know it cannot be long </s>
<s> 

he readily assured her of his secrecy </s>
<s>  again expressed his sorrow for
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only
one serious parting look went away </s>
<s> 

as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in derbyshire </s>
<s>  and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full
of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination </s>
<s> 

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty </s>
<s>  but if
otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object and even before two words have been
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham
and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment </s>
<s>  be that as it may she saw him
go with regret </s>
<s>  and in this early example of what lydias infamy must
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business </s>
<s>  never since reading janes second letter had she entertained
a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her </s>
<s>  no one but jane she thought
could flatter herself with such an expectation </s>
<s>  surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development </s>
<s>  while the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money </s>
<s>  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible </s>
<s>  but now it was all too natural </s>
<s>  for such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms </s>
<s>  and though she did not suppose
lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey </s>
<s> 

she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that
lydia had any partiality for him </s>
<s>  but she was convinced that lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody </s>
<s>  sometimes one
officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions
raised them in her opinion </s>
<s>  her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object </s>
<s>  the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh </s>
<s>  how acutely did she now
feel it </s>
<s> 

she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and
requiring constant attendance </s>
<s>  and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost
importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe </s>
<s>  <abvr>
and <abvr> gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill </s>
<s>  but satisfying them
instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy </s>
<s> though lydia had never been a
favourite with them <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted </s>
<s>  not lydia only but all were concerned in it </s>
<s>  and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror <abvr> gardiner promised every
assistance in his power </s>
<s>  elizabeth though expecting no less thanked
him with tears of gratitude </s>
<s>  and all three being actuated by one spirit
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled </s>
<s>  they were to
be off as soon as possible </s>
<s>  but what is to be done about pemberley </s>
<s> 
 cried <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  john told us <abvr> darcy was here when you sent for
us </s>
<s>  was it so </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement </s>
<s> 
that is all settled </s>
<s> 

what is all settled </s>
<s>  repeated the other as she ran into her room to
prepare </s>
<s>  and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth </s>
<s>  oh that i knew how it was </s>
<s> 

but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour </s>
<s>  had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself </s>
<s>  but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their
sudden departure </s>
<s>  an hour however saw the whole completed </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing
remained to be done but to go </s>
<s>  and elizabeth after all the misery of
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn </s>
<s> 



chapter 


i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they
drove from the town </s>
<s>  and really upon serious consideration i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter </s>
<s>  it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best </s>
<s>  could he expect that her friends
would not step forward </s>
<s>  could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster </s>
<s>  his temptation is
not adequate to the risk </s>
<s> 

do you really think so </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment </s>
<s> 

upon my word said <abvr> gardiner i begin to be of your uncles
opinion </s>
<s>  it is really too great a violation of decency honour and
interest for him to be guilty of </s>
<s>  i cannot think so very ill of
wickham </s>
<s>  can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe
him capable of it </s>
<s> 

not perhaps of neglecting his own interest </s>
<s>  but of every other
neglect i can believe him capable </s>
<s>  if indeed it should be so </s>
<s>  but i
dare not hope it </s>
<s>  why should they not go on to scotland if that had been
the case </s>
<s> 

in the first place replied <abvr> gardiner there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption </s>
<s>  and besides no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road </s>
<s> 

well thensupposing them to be in london </s>
<s>  they may be there though
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose </s>
<s>  it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side </s>
<s>  and it
might strike them that they could be more economically though less
expeditiously married in london than in scotland </s>
<s> 

but why all this secrecy </s>
<s>  why any fear of detection </s>
<s>  why must their
marriage be private </s>
<s>  oh no nothis is not likely </s>
<s>  his most particular
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her </s>
<s>  wickham will never marry a woman without some money </s>
<s>  he
cannot afford it </s>
<s>  and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well </s>
<s>  as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge </s>
<s>  for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce </s>
<s>  but as to your
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good </s>
<s>  lydia has
no brothers to step forward </s>
<s>  and he might imagine from my fathers
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in
such a matter </s>
<s> 

but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage </s>
<s> 

it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with
tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt </s>
<s>  but really i know not what to say </s>
<s> 
perhaps i am not doing her justice </s>
<s>  but she is very young </s>
<s>  she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects </s>
<s>  and for the last halfyear
nay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity </s>
<s>  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way </s>
<s> 
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love
flirtation and officers have been in her head </s>
<s>  she has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give
greaterwhat shall i call it </s>
<s>  susceptibility to her feelings </s>
<s>  which are
naturally lively enough </s>
<s>  and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman </s>
<s> 

but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt </s>
<s> 

of whom does jane ever think ill </s>
<s>  and who is there whatever might be
their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt
till it were proved against them </s>
<s>  but jane knows as well as i do what
wickham really is </s>
<s>  we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word </s>
<s>  that he has neither integrity nor honour </s>
<s>  that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating </s>
<s> 

and do you really know all this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> gardiner whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive </s>
<s> 

i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring </s>
<s>  i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  and you yourself when last at
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him </s>
<s>  and there are other
circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to
relate </s>
<s>  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless </s>
<s>  from
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud
reserved disagreeable girl </s>
<s>  yet he knew to the contrary himself </s>
<s>  he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her </s>
<s> 

but does lydia know nothing of this </s>
<s>  can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> that that is the worst of all </s>
<s>  till i was in kent and saw
so much both of <abvr> darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was
ignorant of the truth myself </s>
<s>  and when i returned home the shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time </s>
<s>  as that was the
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public </s>
<s>  for of what use could
it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown </s>
<s>  and even when it was
settled that lydia should go with <abvr> forster the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me </s>
<s>  that she could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head </s>
<s>  that such a
consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts </s>
<s> 

when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i
suppose to believe them fond of each other </s>
<s> 

not the slightest </s>
<s>  i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side </s>
<s>  and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away </s>
<s>  when first
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him </s>
<s>  but so we all
were </s>
<s>  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months </s>
<s>  but he never distinguished her by any particular
attention </s>
<s>  and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment
who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites </s>
<s> 

                              

it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during
the whole of the journey </s>
<s>  from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent </s>
<s> 
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness </s>
<s> 

they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night
on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day </s>
<s>  it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations </s>
<s> 

the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock </s>
<s>  and when the
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome </s>
<s> 

elizabeth jumped out </s>
<s>  and after giving each of them a hasty kiss
hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her
mothers apartment immediately met her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the
eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives </s>
<s> 

not yet replied jane </s>
<s>  but now that my dear uncle is come i hope
everything will be well </s>
<s> 

is my father in town </s>
<s> 

yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word </s>
<s> 

and have you heard from him often </s>
<s> 

we have heard only twice </s>
<s>  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i
particularly begged him to do </s>
<s>  he merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention </s>
<s> 

and my motherhow is she </s>
<s>  how are you all </s>
<s> 

my mother is tolerably well i trust </s>
<s>  though her spirits are greatly
shaken </s>
<s>  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all </s>
<s>  she does not yet leave her dressingroom </s>
<s>  mary and kitty thank
heaven are quite well </s>
<s> 

but youhow are you </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  you look pale </s>
<s>  how much you
must have gone through </s>
<s> 

her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well </s>
<s>  and their
conversation which had been passing while <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner were
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party </s>
<s>  jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears </s>
<s> 

when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give </s>
<s>  the sanguine hope of
good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her </s>
<s>  she still expected that it would all end well and that
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected </s>
<s>  with
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage </s>
<s> 
blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing </s>
<s> 

if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton
with all my family this would not have happened </s>
<s>  but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her </s>
<s>  why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight </s>
<s>  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after </s>
<s>  i always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her </s>
<s>  but i was overruled as i always am </s>
<s>  poor dear child </s>
<s> 
and now heres <abvr> bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become
of us all </s>
<s>  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we
shall do </s>
<s> 

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas </s>
<s>  and <abvr> gardiner after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist <abvr>
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia </s>
<s> 

do not give way to useless alarm added he </s>
<s>  though it is right to be
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain </s>
<s> 
it is not quite a week since they left brighton </s>
<s>  in a few days more we
may gain some news of them </s>
<s>  and till we know that they are not married
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as
lost </s>
<s>  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make
him come home with me to gracechurch street </s>
<s>  and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear brother replied <abvr> bennet that is exactly what i
could most wish for </s>
<s>  and now do when you get to town find them out
wherever they may be </s>
<s>  and if they are not married already make them
marry </s>
<s>  and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them
after they are married </s>
<s>  and above all keep <abvr> bennet from fighting </s>
<s> 
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my
witsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch
spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that
i can get no rest by night nor by day </s>
<s>  and tell my dear lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does
not know which are the best warehouses </s>
<s>  oh brother how kind you are </s>
<s>  i
know you will contrive it all </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well
in her hopes as her fear </s>
<s>  and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters </s>
<s> 

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to
oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject </s>
<s> 

in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before </s>
<s>  one came from her books and the other from her toilette </s>
<s>  the
faces of both however were tolerably calm </s>
<s>  and no change was visible
in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty </s>
<s>  as for mary she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance
of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table </s>
<s> 

this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of </s>
<s> 
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation </s>
<s> 

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful
lesson </s>
<s>  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable </s>
<s>  that one
false step involves her in endless ruin </s>
<s>  that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful </s>
<s>  and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex </s>
<s> 

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed
to make any reply </s>
<s>  mary however continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them </s>
<s> 

in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for
halfanhour by themselves </s>
<s>  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy </s>
<s>  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued
the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which
i have not already heard </s>
<s>  give me further particulars </s>
<s>  what did colonel
forster say </s>
<s>  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place </s>
<s>  they must have seen them together for ever </s>
<s> 

colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm </s>
<s>  i am so
grieved for him </s>
<s>  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost </s>
<s>  he
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland </s>
<s>  when that apprehension
first got abroad it hastened his journey </s>
<s> 

and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry </s>
<s>  did he know of
their intending to go off </s>
<s>  had colonel forster seen denny himself </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of
their plans and would not give his real opinion about it </s>
<s>  he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before </s>
<s> 

and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a
doubt i suppose of their being really married </s>
<s> 

how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains </s>
<s>  i felt
a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him
in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right </s>
<s>  my father and mother knew nothing of that </s>
<s>  they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be </s>
<s>  kitty then owned with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter
she had prepared her for such a step </s>
<s>  she had known it seems of their
being in love with each other many weeks </s>
<s> 

but not before they went to brighton </s>
<s> 

no i believe not </s>
<s> 

and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself </s>
<s>  does
he know his real character </s>
<s> 

i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did </s>
<s>  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant </s>
<s>  and since this sad
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt </s>
<s> 
but i hope this may be false </s>
<s> 

oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him
this could not have happened </s>
<s> 

perhaps it would have been better replied her sister </s>
<s>  but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were seemed unjustifiable </s>
<s>  we acted with the best intentions </s>
<s> 

could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his
wife </s>
<s> 

he brought it with him for us to see </s>
<s> 

jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth </s>
<s>  these
were the contents </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet

you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am
missed </s>
<s>  i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who
i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i
love and he is an angel </s>
<s>  i should never be happy without him so think
it no harm to be off </s>
<s>  you need not send them word at longbourn of my
going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater
when i write to them and sign my name �lydia wickham </s>
<s>  what a good joke
it will be </s>
<s>  i can hardly write for laughing </s>
<s>  pray make my excuses to
pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight </s>
<s> 
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all </s>
<s>  and tell him i will
dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure </s>
<s>  i shall
send for my clothes when i get to longbourn </s>
<s>  but i wish you would tell
sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s>  give my love to colonel forster </s>
<s>  i hope you will
drink to our good journey </s>
<s> 

your affectionate friend

lydia bennet </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  thoughtless thoughtless lydia </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth when she had
finished it </s>
<s>  what a letter is this to be written at such a moment </s>
<s> 
but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their
journey </s>
<s>  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her
side a scheme of infamy </s>
<s>  my poor father </s>
<s>  how he must have felt it </s>
<s> 

i never saw anyone so shocked </s>
<s>  he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes </s>
<s>  my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in
such confusion </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  i hope there was </s>
<s>  but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult </s>
<s>  my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so
much as i might have done </s>
<s>  but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties </s>
<s> 

your attendance upon her has been too much for you </s>
<s>  you do not look
well </s>
<s>  oh that i had been with you </s>
<s>  you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone </s>
<s> 

mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every
fatigue i am sure </s>
<s>  but i did not think it right for either of them </s>
<s> 
kitty is slight and delicate </s>
<s>  and mary studies so much that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on </s>
<s>  my aunt phillips came to longbourn
on tuesday after my father went away </s>
<s>  and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me </s>
<s>  she was of great use and comfort to us all </s>
<s>  and
lady lucas has been very kind </s>
<s>  she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if
they should be of use to us </s>
<s> 

she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth </s>
<s>  perhaps she
meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see
too little of ones neighbours </s>
<s>  assistance is impossible </s>
<s>  condolence
insufferable </s>
<s>  let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied </s>
<s> 

she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter </s>
<s> 

he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where
they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them </s>
<s>  his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham </s>
<s>  it had come
with a fare from london </s>
<s>  and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham </s>
<s>  if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he
determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach </s>
<s>  i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed </s>
<s>  but he was in such a hurry to be gone
and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this </s>

chapter 


the whole party were in hopes of a letter from <abvr> bennet the next
morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him </s>
<s> 
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent </s>
<s>  but at such a time they had hoped for exertion </s>
<s> 
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send </s>
<s>  but even of that they would have been glad to be certain </s>
<s>  <abvr>
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off </s>
<s> 

when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting
to prevail on <abvr> bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could
to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces </s>
<s>  she shared in their attendance on <abvr> bennet and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom </s>
<s>  their other aunt also
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of
cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them </s>
<s> 

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months
before had been almost an angel of light </s>
<s>  he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family </s>
<s> 
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world </s>
<s> 
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness </s>
<s>  elizabeth though she did not credit above
half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sisters ruin more certain </s>
<s>  and even jane who believed still less
of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come
when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely
despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner left longbourn on sunday </s>
<s>  on tuesday his wife received a
letter from him </s>
<s>  it told them that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street </s>
<s> 
that <abvr> bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival
but without gaining any satisfactory information </s>
<s>  and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as <abvr> bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first
coming to london before they procured lodgings </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it </s>
<s>  he added that <abvr>
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised
to write again very soon </s>
<s>  there was also a postscript to this effect </s>
<s> 

i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if
possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself </s>
<s>  if there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that it might be of essential consequence </s>
<s>  at present we have
nothing to guide us </s>
<s>  colonel forster will i dare say do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head </s>
<s>  but on second thoughts perhaps
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded </s>
<s>  but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved </s>
<s>  she had never
heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both
of whom had been dead many years </s>
<s>  it was possible however that some of
his companions in the shire might be able to give more information </s>
<s> 
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application
was a something to look forward to </s>
<s> 

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety </s>
<s>  but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected </s>
<s>  the arrival of letters
was the grand object of every mornings impatience </s>
<s>  through letters
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance </s>
<s> 

but before they heard again from <abvr> gardiner a letter arrived for
their father from a different quarter from <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  which as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence
she accordingly read </s>
<s>  and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise </s>
<s>  it was as
follows </s>
<s> 

my dear sir

i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation
in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
hertfordshire </s>
<s>  be assured my dear sir that <abvr> collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in
your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove </s>
<s>  no arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that
may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parents mind </s>
<s>  the death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this </s>
<s>  and it is the more to
be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte
informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence </s>
<s>  though at the same time
for the consolation of yourself and <abvr> bennet i am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity at so early an age </s>
<s>  howsoever that may be
you are grievously to be pitied </s>
<s>  in which opinion i am not only joined
by <abvr> collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to
whom i have related the affair </s>
<s>  they agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others </s>
<s>  for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says
will connect themselves with such a family </s>
<s>  and this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event
of last november </s>
<s>  for had it been otherwise i must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace </s>
<s>  let me then advise you dear sir to
console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense </s>
<s> 

i am dear sir etc </s>
<s>  etc </s>

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
colonel forster </s>
<s>  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send </s>
<s> 
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one
living </s>
<s>  his former acquaintances had been numerous </s>
<s>  but since he
had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them </s>
<s>  there was no one therefore
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him </s>
<s>  and in the
wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount </s>
<s>  colonel forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton </s>
<s> 
he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more
formidable </s>
<s>  <abvr> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the longbourn family </s>

<s>  gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day which was saturday </s>
<s>  rendered
spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded
to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit </s>
<s>  when <abvr> bennet was told of this she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before </s>
<s> 

what is he coming home and without poor lydia </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  sure he
will not leave london before he has found them </s>
<s>  who is to fight wickham
and make him marry her if he comes away </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she
and the children should go to london at the same time that <abvr> bennet
came from it </s>
<s>  the coach therefore took them the first stage of their
journey and brought its master back to longbourn </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world </s>
<s>  his
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece </s>
<s>  and
the kind of halfexpectation which <abvr> gardiner had formed of their
being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing </s>
<s>  elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from pemberley </s>
<s> 

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary </s>
<s>  nothing therefore could be
fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of
lydias infamy somewhat better </s>
<s>  it would have spared her she thought
one sleepless night out of two </s>
<s> 

when <abvr> bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure </s>
<s>  he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying </s>
<s>  made no mention of the business that had taken him
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it </s>
<s> 

it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject </s>
<s>  and then on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say
nothing of that </s>
<s>  who should suffer but myself </s>
<s>  it has been my own doing
and i ought to feel it </s>
<s> 

you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth </s>
<s> 

you may well warn me against such an evil </s>
<s>  human nature is so prone
to fall into it </s>
<s>  no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame </s>
<s>  i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression </s>
<s> 
it will pass away soon enough </s>
<s> 

do you suppose them to be in london </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  where else can they be so well concealed </s>
<s> 

and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty </s>
<s> 

she is happy then said her father drily </s>
<s>  and her residence there
will probably be of some duration </s>
<s> 

then after a short silence he continued </s>
<s> 

lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me
last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers
tea </s>
<s> 

this is a parade he cried which does one good </s>
<s>  it gives such an
elegance to misfortune </s>
<s>  another day i will do the same </s>
<s>  i will sit in my
library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as
i can </s>
<s>  or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away </s>
<s> 

i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully </s>
<s>  if i should
ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia </s>
<s> 

you go to brighton </s>
<s>  i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne
for fifty pounds </s>
<s>  no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and
you will feel the effects of it </s>
<s>  no officer is ever to enter into
my house again nor even to pass through the village </s>
<s>  balls will be
absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters </s>
<s> 
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner </s>
<s> 

kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry </s>
<s> 

well well said he do not make yourself unhappy </s>
<s>  if you are a good
girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of
them </s>

chapter 


two days after <abvr> bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother went forward to meet her </s>
<s>  but instead of the expected summons
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask </s>
<s> 

what do you mean hill </s>
<s>  we have heard nothing from town </s>
<s> 

dear madam cried <abvr> hill in great astonishment dont you know
there is an express come for master from <abvr> gardiner </s>
<s>  he has been here
this halfhour and master has had a letter </s>
<s> 

away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech </s>
<s>  they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom </s>
<s>  from thence to the
library </s>
<s>  their father was in neither </s>
<s>  and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the
butler who said </s>
<s> 

if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the
little copse </s>
<s> 

upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once
more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock </s>
<s> 

jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath
came up with him and eagerly cried out </s>
<s> 

oh papa what newswhat news </s>
<s>  have you heard from my uncle </s>
<s> 

yes i have had a letter from him by express </s>
<s> 

well and what news does it bringgood or bad </s>
<s> 

what is there of good to be expected </s>
<s>  said he taking the letter from
his pocket </s>
<s>  but perhaps you would like to read it </s>
<s> 

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand </s>
<s>  jane now came up </s>
<s> 

read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is
about </s>
<s> 

gracechurch street monday august  </s>
<s> 

my dear brother

at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as
upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction </s>
<s>  soon after you
left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
london they were </s>
<s>  the particulars i reserve till we meet </s>
<s>  it is enough
to know they are discovered </s>
<s>  i have seen them both

then it is as i always hoped cried jane </s>
<s>  they are married </s>
<s> 

elizabeth read on </s>
<s> 

i have seen them both </s>
<s>  they are not married nor can i find there
was any intention of being so </s>
<s>  but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will
not be long before they are </s>
<s>  all that is required of you is to assure
to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister </s>
<s>  and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her
during your life one hundred pounds per annum </s>
<s>  these are conditions
which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with
as far as i thought myself privileged for you </s>
<s>  i shall send this by
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer </s>
<s>  you
will easily comprehend from these particulars that <abvr> wickhams
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be </s>
<s> 
the world has been deceived in that respect </s>
<s>  and i am happy to say there
will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to
settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune </s>
<s>  if as i conclude
will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to
haggerston for preparing a proper settlement </s>
<s>  there will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again </s>
<s>  therefore stay quiet at
longbourn and depend on my diligence and care </s>
<s>  send back your answer as
fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly </s>
<s>  we have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope
you will approve </s>
<s>  she comes to us today </s>
<s>  i shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on </s>
<s>  yours etc </s>
<s> 

edw </s>
<s>  gardiner </s>
<s> 

is it possible </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth when she had finished </s>
<s>  can it be
possible that he will marry her </s>
<s> 

wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her
sister </s>
<s>  my dear father i congratulate you </s>
<s> 

and have you answered the letter </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  but it must be done soon </s>
<s> 

most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear father she cried come back and write immediately </s>
<s> 
consider how important every moment is in such a case </s>
<s> 

let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble
yourself </s>
<s> 

i dislike it very much he replied </s>
<s>  but it must be done </s>
<s> 

and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house </s>
<s> 

and may i ask said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but the terms i suppose must be
complied with </s>
<s> 

complied with </s>
<s>  i am only ashamed of his asking so little </s>
<s> 

and they must marry </s>
<s>  yet he is such a man </s>
<s> 

yes yes they must marry </s>
<s>  there is nothing else to be done </s>
<s>  but there
are two things that i want very much to know </s>
<s>  one is how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about </s>
<s>  and the other how am i ever
to pay him </s>
<s> 

money </s>
<s>  my uncle </s>
<s>  cried jane what do you mean sir </s>
<s> 

i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am
gone </s>
<s> 

that is very true said elizabeth </s>
<s>  though it had not occurred to me
before </s>
<s>  his debts to be discharged and something still to remain </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
it must be my uncles doings </s>
<s>  generous good man i am afraid he has
distressed himself </s>
<s>  a small sum could not do all this </s>
<s> 

no said her father </s>
<s>  wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds </s>
<s>  i should be sorry to think so ill of him
in the very beginning of our relationship </s>
<s> 

ten thousand pounds </s>
<s>  heaven forbid </s>
<s>  how is half such a sum to be
repaid </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued
silent till they reached the house </s>
<s>  their father then went on to the
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom </s>
<s> 

and they are really to be married </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth as soon as they
were by themselves </s>
<s>  how strange this is </s>
<s>  and for this we are to be
thankful </s>
<s>  that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice </s>
<s>  oh lydia </s>
<s> 

i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would
not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her </s>
<s>  though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced </s>
<s>  he has children
of his own and may have more </s>
<s>  how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds </s>
<s> 

if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall
exactly know what <abvr> gardiner has done for them because wickham has
not sixpence of his own </s>
<s>  the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited </s>
<s>  their taking her home and affording her their personal
protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge </s>
<s>  by this time she is
actually with them </s>
<s>  if such goodness does not make her miserable now
she will never deserve to be happy </s>
<s>  what a meeting for her when she
first sees my aunt </s>
<s> 

we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said
jane </s>
<s>  i hope and trust they will yet be happy </s>
<s>  his consenting to
marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of
thinking </s>
<s>  their mutual affection will steady them </s>
<s>  and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten </s>
<s> 

their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor
i nor anybody can ever forget </s>
<s>  it is useless to talk of it </s>
<s> 

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened </s>
<s>  they went to the library
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her </s>
<s>  he was writing and without raising his head coolly
replied </s>
<s> 

just as you please </s>
<s> 

may we take my uncles letter to read to her </s>
<s> 

take whatever you like and get away </s>
<s> 

elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs
together </s>
<s>  mary and kitty were both with <abvr> bennet </s>
<s>  one communication
would therefore do for all </s>
<s>  after a slight preparation for good news
the letter was read aloud </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could hardly contain herself </s>
<s>  as
soon as jane had read <abvr> gardiners hope of lydias being soon
married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its
exuberance </s>
<s>  she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation </s>
<s>  to know that her daughter
would be married was enough </s>
<s>  she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct </s>
<s> 

my dear dear lydia </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  this is delightful indeed </s>
<s>  she will
be married </s>
<s>  i shall see her again </s>
<s>  she will be married at sixteen </s>
<s> 
my good kind brother </s>
<s>  i knew how it would be </s>
<s>  i knew he would manage
everything </s>
<s>  how i long to see her </s>
<s>  and to see dear wickham too </s>
<s>  but the
clothes the wedding clothes </s>
<s>  i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly </s>
<s>  lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him
how much he will give her </s>
<s>  stay stay i will go myself </s>
<s>  ring the bell
kitty for hill </s>
<s>  i will put on my things in a moment </s>
<s>  my dear dear
lydia </s>
<s>  how merry we shall be together when we meet </s>
<s> 

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which <abvr>
gardiners behaviour laid them all under </s>
<s> 

for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great
measure to his kindness </s>
<s>  we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist <abvr> wickham with money </s>
<s> 

well cried her mother it is all very right </s>
<s>  who should do it but
her own uncle </s>
<s>  if he had not had a family of his own i and my children
must have had all his money you know </s>
<s>  and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  i am so happy </s>
<s> 
in a short time i shall have a daughter married </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham </s>
<s>  how well
it sounds </s>
<s>  and she was only sixteen last june </s>
<s>  my dear jane i am in
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write </s>
<s>  so i will dictate and
you write for me </s>
<s>  we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards </s>
<s>  but the things should be ordered immediately </s>
<s> 

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had
not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted </s>
<s>  one days delay she observed
would be of small importance </s>
<s>  and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual </s>
<s>  other schemes too came into her head </s>
<s> 

i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the
good good news to my sister philips </s>
<s>  and as i come back i can call
on lady lucas and <abvr> long </s>
<s>  kitty run down and order the carriage </s>
<s> 
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure </s>
<s>  girls can i do
anything for you in meryton </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  here comes hill </s>
<s>  my dear hill have you
heard the good news </s>
<s>  miss lydia is going to be married </s>
<s>  and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hill began instantly to express her joy </s>
<s>  elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom </s>
<s> 

poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough </s>
<s>  but that it was
no worse she had need to be thankful </s>
<s>  she felt it so </s>
<s>  and though in
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had
feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived
him </s>
<s>  he now wished it more than ever </s>
<s>  had he done his duty in that
respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her </s>
<s>  the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place </s>
<s> 

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he
was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could </s>
<s> 

when first <abvr> bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly
useless for of course they were to have a son </s>
<s>  the son was to join
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for </s>
<s>  five daughters
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he
would </s>
<s>  this event had at last been despaired of but it was then
too late to be saving </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet had no turn for economy and her
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income </s>
<s> 

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <abvr> bennet and
the children </s>
<s>  but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents </s>
<s>  this was one point with
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and <abvr> bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him </s>
<s>  in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother
though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him </s>
<s>  he had never before supposed
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement </s>
<s>  he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them </s>
<s>  for what with her board and pocket
allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within
that sum </s>
<s> 

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was
another very welcome surprise </s>
<s>  for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible </s>
<s>  when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he
naturally returned to all his former indolence </s>
<s>  his letter was soon
dispatched </s>
<s>  for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick
in its execution </s>
<s>  he begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her </s>
<s> 

the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood </s>
<s>  it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy </s>
<s>  to be sure it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town </s>
<s>  or as the
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant
farmhouse </s>
<s>  but there was much to be talked of in marrying her </s>
<s>  and the
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain </s>
<s> 

it was a fortnight since <abvr> bennet had been downstairs </s>
<s>  but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in
spirits oppressively high </s>
<s>  no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph </s>
<s>  the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object
of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and
servants </s>
<s>  she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering
what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and
importance </s>
<s> 

haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor the
great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger </s>
<s>  but ashworth is
too far off </s>
<s>  i could not bear to have her ten miles from me </s>
<s>  and as for
pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful </s>
<s> 

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained </s>
<s>  but when they had withdrawn he said to her </s>
<s>  <abvr>
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter let us come to a right understanding </s>
<s>  into one house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance </s>
<s>  i will not encourage the
impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn </s>
<s> 

a long dispute followed this declaration </s>
<s>  but <abvr> bennet was firm </s>
<s>  it
soon led to another </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet found with amazement and horror
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter </s>
<s>  he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could hardly comprehend
it </s>
<s>  that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe
possible </s>
<s>  she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of
the moment been led to make <abvr> darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister </s>
<s>  for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot </s>
<s> 

she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means </s>
<s>  there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended </s>
<s> 
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters
frailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate
there seemed a gulf impassable between them </s>
<s>  had lydias marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that
mr </s>
<s>  darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned </s>
<s> 

from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink </s>
<s>  the
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this </s>
<s>  she was humbled she was grieved </s>
<s>  she repented though she
hardly knew of what </s>
<s>  she became jealous of his esteem when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it </s>
<s>  she wanted to hear of him when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence </s>
<s>  she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they
should meet </s>
<s> 

what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received </s>
<s>  he was as generous she
doubted not as the most generous of his sex </s>
<s>  but while he was mortal
there must be a triumph </s>
<s> 

she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in
disposition and talents would most suit her </s>
<s>  his understanding and
temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes </s>
<s>  it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both </s>
<s>  by her ease
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved </s>
<s> 
and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she
must have received benefit of greater importance </s>
<s> 

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was </s>
<s>  an union of a different tendency and
precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their
family </s>
<s> 

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence
she could not imagine </s>
<s>  but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture </s>
<s> 

                              

mr </s>
<s>  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother </s>
<s>  to <abvr> bennets
acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family </s>
<s>  and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again </s>
<s>  the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that <abvr> wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia </s>
<s> 

it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as
his marriage was fixed on </s>
<s>  and i think you will agree with me in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on
his account and my nieces </s>
<s>  it is <abvr> wickhams intention to go into
the regulars </s>
<s>  and among his former friends there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army </s>
<s>  he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general �s regiment now quartered in the north </s>
<s>  it
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom </s>
<s>  he
promises fairly </s>
<s>  and i hope among different people where they may each
have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent </s>
<s>  i have
written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of <abvr> wickham
in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i
have pledged myself </s>
<s>  and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin
a list according to his information </s>
<s>  he has given in all his debts </s>
<s>  i
hope at least he has not deceived us </s>
<s>  haggerston has our directions
and all will be completed in a week </s>
<s>  they will then join his regiment
unless they are first invited to longbourn </s>
<s>  and i understand from <abvr>
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she

from the shire as clearly as <abvr> gardiner could do </s>

was not so well pleased with it </s>
<s>  lydias being settled in the north
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company

she is so fond of <abvr> forster said she it will be quite shocking

chapter 


their sisters wedding day arrived </s>
<s>  and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself </s>
<s>  the carriage was sent to
meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime </s>
<s>  their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she
been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure </s>
<s> 

they came </s>
<s>  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them </s>
<s>  smiles decked the face of <abvr> bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door </s>
<s>  her husband looked impenetrably grave </s>
<s>  her daughters alarmed
anxious uneasy </s>
<s> 

lydias voice was heard in the vestibule </s>
<s>  the door was thrown open and
she ran into the room </s>
<s>  her mother stepped forwards embraced her and
welcomed her with rapture </s>
<s>  gave her hand with an affectionate smile
to wickham who followed his lady </s>
<s>  and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness </s>
<s> 

their reception from <abvr> bennet to whom they then turned was not quite
so cordial </s>
<s>  his countenance rather gained in austerity </s>
<s>  and he scarcely
opened his lips </s>
<s>  the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was
enough to provoke him </s>
<s>  elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet
was shocked </s>
<s>  lydia was lydia still </s>
<s>  untamed unabashed wild noisy
and fearless </s>
<s>  she turned from sister to sister demanding their
congratulations </s>
<s>  and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and
observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been
there </s>
<s> 

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all </s>
<s>  elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance </s>
<s>  but she sat down
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man </s>
<s>  she blushed and jane blushed </s>
<s>  but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour </s>
<s> 

there was no want of discourse </s>
<s>  the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough </s>
<s>  and wickham who happened to sit near
elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies </s>
<s>  they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world </s>
<s>  nothing of the past was recollected with pain </s>
<s>  and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world </s>
<s> 

only think of its being three months she cried since i went away </s>
<s> 
it seems but a fortnight i declare </s>
<s>  and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time </s>
<s>  good gracious </s>
<s>  when i went away i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again </s>
<s>  though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was </s>
<s> 

her father lifted up his eyes </s>
<s>  jane was distressed </s>
<s>  elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia </s>
<s>  but she who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh </s>
<s>  mamma do the
people hereabouts know i am married today </s>
<s>  i was afraid they might not </s>
<s> 
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he
should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took
off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that
he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could bear it no longer </s>
<s>  she got up and ran out of the room </s>
<s> 
and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour </s>
<s>  she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say
to her eldest sister ah </s>
<s>  jane i take your place now and you must go
lower because i am a married woman </s>
<s> 

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first </s>
<s>  her ease and good
spirits increased </s>
<s>  she longed to see <abvr> phillips the lucases and
all their other neighbours and to hear herself called <abvr> wickham
 by each of them </s>
<s>  and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her
ring and boast of being married to <abvr> hill and the two housemaids </s>
<s> 

well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast
room and what do you think of my husband </s>
<s>  is not he a charming man </s>
<s>  i
am sure my sisters must all envy me </s>
<s>  i only hope they may have half
my good luck </s>
<s>  they must all go to brighton </s>
<s>  that is the place to get
husbands </s>
<s>  what a pity it is mamma we did not all go </s>
<s> 

very true </s>
<s>  and if i had my will we should </s>
<s>  but my dear lydia i dont
at all like your going such a way off </s>
<s>  must it be so </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> there is nothing in that </s>
<s>  i shall like it of all
things </s>
<s>  you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us </s>
<s>  we
shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some
balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all </s>
<s> 

i should like it beyond anything </s>
<s>  said her mother </s>
<s> 

and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you </s>
<s>  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over </s>
<s> 

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth </s>
<s>  but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands </s>
<s> 

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them </s>
<s>  <abvr> wickham
had received his commission before he left london and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight </s>
<s> 

no one but <abvr> bennet regretted that their stay would be so short </s>
<s>  and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and
having very frequent parties at home </s>
<s>  these parties were acceptable to
all </s>
<s>  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not </s>
<s> 

wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected
to find it </s>
<s>  not equal to lydias for him </s>
<s>  she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his </s>
<s>  and she would have wondered why without violently caring
for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances </s>
<s>  and
if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion </s>
<s> 

lydia was exceedingly fond of him </s>
<s>  he was her dear wickham on every
occasion </s>
<s>  no one was to be put in competition with him </s>
<s>  he did every
thing best in the world </s>
<s>  and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september than any body else in the country </s>
<s> 

one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters she said to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe </s>
<s>  you
were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it </s>
<s>  are not you
curious to hear how it was managed </s>
<s> 

no really replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  you are so strange </s>
<s>  but i must tell you how it went off </s>
<s>  we were
married you know at st </s>
<s>  clements because wickhams lodgings were in
that parish </s>
<s>  and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
oclock </s>
<s>  my uncle and aunt and i were to go together </s>
<s>  and the others
were to meet us at the church </s>
<s>  well monday morning came and i was in
such a fuss </s>
<s>  i was so afraid you know that something would happen to
put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted </s>
<s>  and there was
my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon </s>
<s>  however i did not hear above one word in
ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham </s>
<s>  i longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat </s>
<s> 

well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual </s>
<s>  i thought it would never
be over </s>
<s>  for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them </s>
<s>  if youll believe
me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a
fortnight </s>
<s>  not one party or scheme or anything </s>
<s>  to be sure london was
rather thin but however the little theatre was open </s>
<s>  well and so
just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man <abvr> stone </s>
<s>  and then you know when once
they get together there is no end of it </s>
<s>  well i was so frightened i
did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away </s>
<s>  and if we
were beyond the hour we could not be married all day </s>
<s>  but luckily he
came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out </s>
<s>  however
i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the
wedding need not be put off for <abvr> darcy might have done as well </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy </s>
<s>  repeated elizabeth in utter amazement </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> he was to come there with wickham you know </s>
<s>  but gracious
me </s>
<s>  i quite forgot </s>
<s>  i ought not to have said a word about it </s>
<s>  i promised
them so faithfully </s>
<s>  what will wickham say </s>
<s>  it was to be such a secret </s>
<s> 

if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the
subject </s>
<s>  you may depend upon my seeking no further </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity </s>
<s>  we will
ask you no questions </s>
<s> 

thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you
all and then wickham would be angry </s>
<s> 

on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power by running away </s>
<s> 

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible </s>
<s>  or at least
it was impossible not to try for information </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy had been at
her sisters wedding </s>
<s>  it was exactly a scene and exactly among people
where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go </s>
<s> 
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her
brain </s>
<s>  but she was satisfied with none </s>
<s>  those that best pleased her as
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable </s>
<s>  she
could not bear such suspense </s>
<s>  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper
wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended </s>
<s> 

you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such
a time </s>
<s>  pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is
for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems
to think necessary </s>
<s>  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance </s>
<s> 

not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished
the letter </s>
<s>  and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out </s>
<s> 

janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall </s>
<s>  elizabeth was glad
of it </s>
<s> till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could </s>
<s>  she was no sooner in possession of it
than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to
be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy </s>
<s>  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial </s>
<s> 

gracechurch street sept </s>
<s>   </s>
<s> 

my dear niece

i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise
what i have to tell you </s>
<s>  i must confess myself surprised by your
application </s>
<s>  i did not expect it from you </s>
<s>  dont think me angry
however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on your side </s>
<s>  if you do not choose to
understand me forgive my impertinence </s>
<s>  your uncle is as much surprised
as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done </s>
<s>  but if you are really
innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit </s>
<s> 

on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy called and was shut up with him several
hours </s>
<s>  it was all over before i arrived </s>
<s>  so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been </s>
<s>  he came to tell <abvr>
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and <abvr> wickham were
and that he had seen and talked with them both </s>
<s>  wickham repeatedly
lydia once </s>
<s>  from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day
after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them </s>
<s>  the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him </s>
<s>  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world </s>
<s>  his character was to speak for itself </s>
<s>  he
called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself </s>
<s>  if he had another
motive i am sure it would never disgrace him </s>
<s>  he had been some days
in town before he was able to discover them </s>
<s>  but he had something to
direct his search which was more than we had </s>
<s>  and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us </s>
<s> 

there is a lady it seems a <abvr> younge who was some time ago
governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation though he did not say what </s>
<s>  she then took a large
house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings </s>
<s>  this <abvr> younge was he knew intimately acquainted with
wickham </s>
<s>  and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town </s>
<s>  but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted </s>
<s>  she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and
corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found </s>
<s> 
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had
she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up
their abode with her </s>
<s>  at length however our kind friend procured the
wishedfor direction </s>
<s>  they were in  street </s>
<s>  he saw wickham and
afterwards insisted on seeing lydia </s>
<s>  his first object with her he
acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go </s>
<s>  but
he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was </s>
<s>  she cared
for none of her friends </s>
<s>  she wanted no help of his </s>
<s>  she would not hear
of leaving wickham </s>
<s>  she was sure they should be married some time or
other and it did not much signify when </s>
<s>  since such were her feelings
it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which
in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never
been his design </s>
<s>  he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment
on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing </s>
<s>  and
scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her
own folly alone </s>
<s>  he meant to resign his commission immediately </s>
<s>  and as
to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it </s>
<s>  he
must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have
nothing to live on </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once </s>
<s>  though
mr </s>
<s>  bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able
to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage </s>
<s>  but he found in reply to this question that wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country </s>
<s>  under such circumstances however he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief </s>
<s> 

they met several times for there was much to be discussed </s>
<s>  wickham of
course wanted more than he could get </s>
<s>  but at length was reduced to be
reasonable </s>
<s> 

every thing being settled between them <abvr> darcys next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch
street the evening before i came home </s>
<s>  but <abvr> gardiner could not be
seen and <abvr> darcy found on further inquiry that your father was
still with him but would quit town the next morning </s>
<s>  he did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former </s>
<s>  he did not leave his name and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business </s>
<s> 

on saturday he came again </s>
<s>  your father was gone your uncle at home
and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together </s>
<s> 

they met again on sunday and then i saw him too </s>
<s>  it was not all
settled before monday </s>
<s>  as soon as it was the express was sent off to
longbourn </s>
<s>  but our visitor was very obstinate </s>
<s>  i fancy lizzy that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all </s>
<s>  he has been
accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one </s>
<s> 
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself </s>
<s>  though i am sure and
i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole </s>
<s> 

they battled it together for a long time which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved </s>
<s>  but at last your uncle
was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it
which went sorely against the grain </s>
<s>  and i really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where
it was due </s>
<s>  but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane
at most </s>
<s> 

you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young
people </s>
<s>  his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably
more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon her and his commission purchased </s>
<s>  the reason why all
this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above </s>
<s>  it
was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that
wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was </s>
<s>  perhaps there was some truth
in this </s>
<s>  though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve
can be answerable for the event </s>
<s>  but in spite of all this fine talking
my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another
interest in the affair </s>
<s> 

when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who
were still staying at pemberley </s>
<s>  but it was agreed that he should be in
london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish </s>
<s> 

i believe i have now told you every thing </s>
<s>  it is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise </s>
<s>  i hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure </s>
<s>  lydia came to us </s>
<s>  and wickham had constant
admission to the house </s>
<s>  he was exactly what he had been when i
knew him in hertfordshire </s>
<s>  but i would not tell you how little i was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not
perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell
you can give you no fresh pain </s>
<s>  i talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family </s>
<s>  if she
heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen </s>
<s>  i was
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and
jane and for their sakes had patience with her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you
attended the wedding </s>
<s>  he dined with us the next day and was to leave
town again on wednesday or thursday </s>
<s>  will you be very angry with me my
dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
enough to say before how much i like him </s>
<s>  his behaviour to us has
in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire </s>
<s>  his
understanding and opinions all please me </s>
<s>  he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach
him </s>
<s>  i thought him very sly </s>
<s> he hardly ever mentioned your name </s>
<s>  but
slyness seems the fashion </s>
<s> 

pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from p </s>
<s>  i shall never be quite happy
till i have been all round the park </s>
<s>  a low phaeton with a nice little
pair of ponies would be the very thing </s>
<s> 

but i must write no more </s>
<s>  the children have been wanting me this half
hour </s>
<s> 

yours very sincerely

<s> 

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share </s>
<s>  the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what <abvr> darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the
pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true </s>
<s> 
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research </s>
<s>  in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason
with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce </s>
<s>  he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem </s>
<s>  her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her </s>
<s>  but it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor
a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham </s>
<s>  brotherinlaw
of wickham </s>
<s>  every kind of pride must revolt from the connection </s>
<s>  he had
to be sure done much </s>
<s>  she was ashamed to think how much </s>
<s>  but he had
given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief </s>
<s>  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong </s>
<s>  he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it </s>
<s>  and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she
could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned </s>
<s>  it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return </s>
<s>  they
owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him </s>
<s>  for
herself she was humbled </s>
<s>  but she was proud of him </s>
<s>  proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself </s>
<s> 
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again </s>
<s>  it
was hardly enough </s>
<s>  but it pleased her </s>
<s>  she was even sensible of some
pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between <abvr> darcy and herself </s>
<s> 

she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones
approach </s>
<s>  and before she could strike into another path she was
overtaken by wickham </s>
<s> 

i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister </s>

as he joined her </s>
<s> 

you certainly do she replied with a smile </s>

she replied in the affirmative </s>

i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle </s>

yes she did </s>

and what did she say </s>

out well </s>

i was surprised to see darcy in town last month </s>
<s>  we passed each other
several times </s>
<s>  i wonder what he can be doing there </s>
<s> 

perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said
elizabeth </s>
<s>  it must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  did you see him while you were at lambton </s>
<s>  i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  he introduced us to his sister </s>
<s> 

and do you like her </s>
<s> 

very much </s>
<s> 

i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two </s>
<s>  when i last saw her she was not very promising </s>
<s>  i am very glad
you liked her </s>
<s>  i hope she will turn out well </s>
<s> 

i dare say she will </s>
<s>  she has got over the most trying age </s>
<s> 

did you go by the village of kympton </s>
<s> 

i do not recollect that we did </s>
<s> 

i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had </s>
<s>  a
most delightful place </s>
<s> excellent parsonage house </s>
<s>  it would have suited
me in every respect </s>
<s> 

how should you have liked making sermons </s>
<s> 

exceedingly well </s>
<s>  i should have considered it as part of my duty
and the exertion would soon have been nothing </s>
<s>  one ought not to
repine </s>
<s> but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me </s>
<s>  the
quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness </s>
<s>  but it was not to be </s>
<s>  did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent </s>
<s> 

i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was
left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron </s>
<s> 

you have </s>
<s>  yes there was something in that </s>
<s>  i told you so from the
first you may remember </s>
<s> 

i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present </s>
<s>  that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business
had been compromised accordingly </s>
<s> 

you did </s>
<s>  and it was not wholly without foundation </s>
<s>  you may remember
what i told you on that point when first we talked of it </s>
<s> 

they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast
to get rid of him </s>
<s>  and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him
she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile </s>
<s> 

come <abvr> wickham we are brother and sister you know </s>
<s>  do not let
us quarrel about the past </s>
<s>  in future i hope we shall be always of one
mind </s>

she held out her hand </s>
<s>  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though
he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house </s>

chapter 


mr </s>
<s>  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth
by introducing the subject of it </s>
<s>  and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet </s>
<s> 

the day of his and lydias departure soon came and <abvr> bennet was
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again </s>
<s> 

oh lord </s>
<s>  i dont know </s>
<s>  not these two or three years perhaps </s>
<s> 

write to me very often my dear </s>
<s> 

as often as i can </s>
<s>  but you know married women have never much time for
writing </s>
<s>  my sisters may write to me </s>
<s>  they will have nothing else to
do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes </s>
<s>  he
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things </s>
<s> 

he is as fine a fellow said <abvr> bennet as soon as they were out of
the house as ever i saw </s>
<s>  he simpers and smirks and makes love to
us all </s>
<s>  i am prodigiously proud of him </s>
<s>  i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw </s>
<s> 

the loss of her daughter made <abvr> bennet very dull for several days </s>
<s> 

i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with
ones friends </s>
<s>  one seems so forlorn without them </s>
<s> 

this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said
elizabeth </s>
<s>  it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single </s>
<s> 

it is no such thing </s>
<s>  lydia does not leave me because she is married
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off </s>
<s>  if
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon </s>
<s> 

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation </s>
<s>  the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several
weeks </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was quite in the fidgets </s>
<s>  she looked at jane and
smiled and shook her head by turns </s>
<s> 

well well and so <abvr> bingley is coming down sister for <abvr>
phillips first brought her the news </s>
<s>  well so much the better </s>
<s>  not
that i care about it though </s>
<s>  he is nothing to us you know and i am
sure i never want to see him again </s>
<s>  but however he is very welcome
to come to netherfield if he likes it </s>
<s>  and who knows what may happen </s>
<s> 
but that is nothing to us </s>
<s>  you know sister we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it </s>
<s>  and so is it quite certain he is coming </s>
<s> 

you may depend on it replied the other for <abvr> nicholls was in
meryton last night </s>
<s>  i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it </s>
<s>  and she told me that it was certain true </s>
<s>  he
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday </s>
<s>  she was
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed </s>
<s> 

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour </s>
<s>  it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth </s>
<s>  but now as soon as they were alone together she said </s>
<s> 

i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present
report </s>
<s>  and i know i appeared distressed </s>
<s>  but dont imagine it was from
any silly cause </s>
<s>  i was only confused for the moment because i felt that
i should be looked at </s>
<s>  i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain </s>
<s>  i am glad of one thing that he comes
alone </s>
<s>  because we shall see the less of him </s>
<s>  not that i am afraid of
myself but i dread other peoples remarks </s>
<s> 

elizabeth did not know what to make of it </s>
<s>  had she not seen him in
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged </s>
<s>  but she still thought him partial
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come
without it </s>
<s> 

yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this
speculation </s>
<s>  i will leave him to himself </s>
<s> 

in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it </s>
<s>  they were more disturbed
more unequal than she had often seen them </s>
<s> 

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents
about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again </s>
<s> 

as soon as ever <abvr> bingley comes my dear said <abvr> bennet you
will wait on him of course </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i
went to see him he should marry one of my daughters </s>
<s>  but it ended in
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again </s>
<s> 

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to
netherfield </s>
<s> 

�tis an etiquette i despise said he </s>
<s>  if he wants our society
let him seek it </s>
<s>  he knows where we live </s>
<s>  i will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again </s>
<s> 

well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him </s>
<s>  but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i
am determined </s>
<s>  we must have <abvr> long and the gouldings soon </s>
<s>  that will
make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for
him </s>
<s> 

consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her
husbands incivility </s>
<s>  though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see <abvr> bingley in consequence of it before
they did </s>
<s>  as the day of his arrival drew near

i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister </s>
<s>  it
would be nothing </s>
<s>  i could see him with perfect indifference but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of </s>
<s>  my mother means well </s>
<s> 
but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says </s>
<s>  happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over </s>
<s> 

i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but it
is wholly out of my power </s>
<s>  you must feel it </s>
<s>  and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have
always so much </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley arrived </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet through the assistance of servants
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could </s>
<s>  she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent </s>
<s> 
hopeless of seeing him before </s>
<s>  but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window
enter the paddock and ride towards the house </s>
<s> 

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy </s>
<s>  jane resolutely
kept her place at the table </s>
<s>  but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went
to the windowshe lookedshe saw <abvr> darcy with him and sat down
again by her sister </s>
<s> 

there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty </s>
<s>  who can it be </s>
<s> 

some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose </s>
<s>  i am sure i do not
know </s>
<s> 

la </s>
<s>  replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before </s>
<s>  <abvr> whatshisname </s>
<s>  that tall proud man </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> and so it does i vow </s>
<s>  well any friend of
mr </s>
<s>  bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure </s>
<s>  but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him </s>
<s> 

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern </s>
<s>  she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter </s>
<s>  both sisters were uncomfortable
enough </s>
<s>  each felt for the other and of course for themselves </s>
<s>  and their
mother talked on of her dislike of <abvr> darcy and her resolution to be
civil to him only as <abvr> bingleys friend without being heard by either
of them </s>
<s>  but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew <abvr>
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him </s>
<s> 
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused
and whose merit she had undervalued </s>
<s>  but to her own more extensive
information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as
what jane felt for bingley </s>
<s>  her astonishment at his comingat his
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire </s>
<s> 

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken </s>
<s>  but she would not be secure </s>
<s> 

let me first see how he behaves said she </s>
<s>  it will then be early
enough for expectation </s>
<s> 

she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door </s>
<s>  jane looked a little
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected </s>
<s>  on the
gentlemens appearing her colour increased </s>
<s>  yet she received them with
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance </s>
<s> 

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command </s>
<s>  she
had ventured only one glance at darcy </s>
<s>  he looked serious as usual </s>
<s>  and
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as
she had seen him at pemberley </s>
<s>  but perhaps he could not in her mothers
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt </s>
<s>  it was a painful but
not an improbable conjecture </s>
<s> 

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed </s>
<s>  he was received by <abvr>
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend </s>
<s> 

elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied </s>
<s> 

darcy after inquiring of her how <abvr> and <abvr> gardiner did a question
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything </s>
<s>  he
was not seated by her </s>
<s>  perhaps that was the reason of his silence </s>
<s>  but
it had not been so in derbyshire </s>
<s>  there he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself </s>
<s>  but now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice </s>
<s>  and when occasionally unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but
the ground </s>
<s>  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when
they last met were plainly expressed </s>
<s>  she was disappointed and angry
with herself for being so </s>
<s> 

could i expect it to be otherwise </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  yet why did he come </s>
<s> 

she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself </s>
<s>  and to
him she had hardly courage to speak </s>
<s> 

she inquired after his sister but could do no more </s>
<s> 

it is a long time <abvr> bingley since you went away said <abvr> bennet </s>
<s> 

he readily agreed to it </s>
<s> 

i began to be afraid you would never come back again </s>
<s>  people did say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas </s>
<s>  but however i hope
it is not true </s>
<s>  a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away </s>
<s>  miss lucas is married and settled </s>
<s>  and one of my
own daughters </s>
<s>  i suppose you have heard of it </s>
<s>  indeed you must have
seen it in the papers </s>
<s>  it was in the times and the courier i know </s>
<s> 
though it was not put in as it ought to be </s>
<s>  it was only said �lately
george wickham esq </s>
<s>  to miss lydia bennet without there being a
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything </s>
<s> 
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it </s>
<s>  did you see it </s>
<s> 

bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations </s>
<s>  elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes </s>
<s>  how <abvr> darcy looked therefore she could
not tell </s>
<s> 

it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married
 continued her mother but at the same time <abvr> bingley it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me </s>
<s>  they are gone down to
newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay
i do not know how long </s>
<s>  his regiment is there </s>
<s>  for i suppose you have
heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the
regulars </s>
<s>  thank heaven </s>
<s>  he has some friends though perhaps not so
many as he deserves </s>
<s> 

elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at <abvr> darcy was in such
misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat </s>
<s>  it drew from her
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually
done before </s>
<s>  and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present </s>
<s>  a few weeks he believed </s>
<s> 

when you have killed all your own birds <abvr> bingley said her mother
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on <abvr>
bennets manor </s>
<s>  i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and
will save all the best of the covies for you </s>
<s> 

elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious
attention </s>
<s>  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion </s>
<s>  at that instant she felt
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion </s>
<s> 

the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to
be in company with either of them </s>
<s>  their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this </s>
<s>  let me never see either
one or the other again </s>
<s> 

yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her
former lover </s>
<s>  when first he came in he had spoken to her but little </s>
<s> 
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention </s>
<s>  he
found her as handsome as she had been last year </s>
<s>  as good natured and
as unaffected though not quite so chatty </s>
<s>  jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever </s>
<s>  but her mind was so busily engaged
that she did not always know when she was silent </s>
<s> 

when the gentlemen rose to go away <abvr> bennet was mindful of her
intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time </s>
<s> 

you are quite a visit in my debt <abvr> bingley she added for when
you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned </s>
<s>  i have not forgot you see </s>
<s>  and i assure
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement </s>
<s> 

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business </s>
<s>  they then went away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day </s>
<s>  but though she always kept a very good table she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year </s>
<s> 



chapter 


as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits </s>
<s> 
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her </s>
<s> 

why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she
did he come at all </s>
<s> 

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure </s>
<s> 

he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when
he was in town </s>
<s>  and why not to me </s>
<s>  if he fears me why come hither </s>
<s>  if
he no longer cares for me why silent </s>
<s>  teasing teasing man </s>
<s>  i will
think no more about him </s>
<s> 

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth </s>
<s> 

now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly
easy </s>
<s>  i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming </s>
<s>  i am glad he dines here on tuesday </s>
<s>  it will then be publicly
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly </s>
<s>  oh jane
take care </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now </s>
<s> 

i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever </s>
<s> 

                              

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet in
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good
humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had
revived </s>
<s> 

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn </s>
<s>  and the two
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen were in very good time </s>
<s>  when they repaired to the
diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by
her sister </s>
<s>  her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore
to invite him to sit by herself </s>
<s>  on entering the room he seemed to
hesitate </s>
<s>  but jane happened to look round and happened to smile </s>
<s>  it was
decided </s>
<s>  he placed himself by her </s>
<s> 

elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend </s>
<s> 
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards <abvr> darcy with an expression of halflaughing
alarm </s>
<s> 

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his
own would be speedily secured </s>
<s>  though she dared not depend upon the
consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour </s>
<s>  it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast </s>
<s>  for she was in
no cheerful humour </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them </s>
<s>  he was on one side of her mother </s>
<s>  she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to
advantage </s>
<s>  she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did </s>
<s>  her mothers ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind </s>
<s> 
and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family </s>
<s> 

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together </s>
<s>  that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance </s>
<s>  anxious
and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil </s>
<s>  she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend </s>
<s> 

if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for
ever </s>
<s> 

the gentlemen came </s>
<s>  and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  the ladies had crowded round the table
where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair </s>
<s>  and on the gentlemens approaching one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper </s>
<s> 

the men shant come and part us i am determined </s>
<s>  we want none of them </s>
<s> 
do we </s>
<s> 

darcy had walked away to another part of the room </s>
<s>  she followed him with
her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee </s>
<s>  and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly </s>
<s> 

a man who has once been refused </s>
<s>  how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love </s>
<s>  is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman </s>
<s> 
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings </s>
<s> 

she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself </s>
<s>  and she seized the opportunity of saying </s>
<s> 

is your sister at pemberley still </s>
<s> 

yes she will remain there till christmas </s>
<s> 

and quite alone </s>
<s>  have all her friends left her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  annesley is with her </s>
<s>  the others have been gone on to scarborough
these three weeks </s>
<s> 

she could think of nothing more to say </s>
<s>  but if he wished to converse
with her he might have better success </s>
<s>  he stood by her however for
some minutes in silence </s>
<s>  and at last on the young ladys whispering
to elizabeth again he walked away </s>
<s> 

when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies
all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party </s>
<s>  she now lost every expectation of pleasure </s>
<s> 
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper </s>
<s>  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others and she had no opportunity of detaining them </s>
<s> 

well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what
say you to the day </s>
<s>  i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well
i assure you </s>
<s>  the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw </s>
<s>  the
venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch </s>
<s>  the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases last week </s>
<s>  and even <abvr> darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done </s>
<s>  and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least </s>
<s>  and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater
beauty </s>
<s>  <abvr> long said so too for i asked her whether you did not </s>
<s>  and
what do you think she said besides </s>
<s>  �ah </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet we shall have her
at netherfield at last </s>
<s>  she did indeed </s>
<s>  i do think <abvr> long is as good
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls
and not at all handsome </s>
<s>  i like them prodigiously </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet in short was in very great spirits </s>
<s>  she had seen enough of
bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last </s>
<s>  and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals </s>
<s> 

it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth </s>
<s>  the
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other </s>
<s>  i hope we
may often meet again </s>
<s> 

elizabeth smiled </s>
<s> 

lizzy you must not do so </s>
<s>  you must not suspect me </s>
<s>  it mortifies me </s>
<s> 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it </s>
<s>  i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had
any design of engaging my affection </s>
<s>  it is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man </s>
<s> 

you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and
are provoking me to it every moment </s>
<s> 

how hard it is in some cases to be believed </s>
<s> 

and how impossible in others </s>
<s> 

but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge </s>
<s> 

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer </s>
<s>  we all love to
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing </s>
<s>  forgive
me </s>
<s>  and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante </s>

chapter 


a few days after this visit <abvr> bingley called again and alone </s>
<s>  his
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in
ten days time </s>
<s>  he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably
good spirits </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet invited him to dine with them </s>
<s>  but with many
expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere </s>
<s> 

next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky </s>
<s> 

he should be particularly happy at any time etc </s>
<s>  etc </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and if she would
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them </s>
<s> 

can you come tomorrow </s>
<s> 

yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow </s>
<s>  and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity </s>
<s> 

he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed </s>
<s>  in ran <abvr> bennet to her daughters room in her dressing
gown and with her hair half finished crying out </s>
<s> 

my dear jane make haste and hurry down </s>
<s>  he is comemr </s>
<s>  bingley is
come </s>
<s>  he is indeed </s>
<s>  make haste make haste </s>
<s>  here sarah come to miss
bennet this moment and help her on with her gown </s>
<s>  never mind miss
lizzys hair </s>
<s> 

we will be down as soon as we can said jane </s>
<s>  but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  hang kitty </s>
<s>  what has she to do with it </s>
<s>  come be quick be quick </s>
<s> 
where is your sash my dear </s>
<s> 

but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters </s>
<s> 

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening </s>
<s>  after tea <abvr> bennet retired to the library as was his
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument </s>
<s>  two obstacles of
the five being thus removed <abvr> bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any
impression on them </s>
<s>  elizabeth would not observe her </s>
<s>  and when at last
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma </s>
<s>  what do
you keep winking at me for </s>
<s>  what am i to do </s>
<s> 

nothing child nothing </s>
<s>  i did not wink at you </s>
<s>  she then sat still
five minutes longer </s>
<s>  but unable to waste such a precious occasion she
suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to
speak to you took her out of the room </s>
<s>  jane instantly gave a look
at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her
entreaty that she would not give in to it </s>
<s>  in a few minutes <abvr>
bennet halfopened the door and called out </s>
<s> 

lizzy my dear i want to speak with you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was forced to go </s>
<s> 

we may as well leave them by themselves you know </s>
<s>  said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall </s>
<s>  kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in
my dressingroom </s>
<s> 

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned
into the drawingroom </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual </s>
<s>  bingley was every
thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter </s>
<s>  his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party </s>
<s>  and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter </s>
<s> 

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper </s>
<s>  and before he went
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and <abvr>
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband </s>
<s> 

after this day jane said no more of her indifference </s>
<s>  not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley </s>
<s>  but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless <abvr> darcy
returned within the stated time </s>
<s>  seriously however she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans
concurrence </s>
<s> 

bingley was punctual to his appointment </s>
<s>  and he and <abvr> bennet spent
the morning together as had been agreed on </s>
<s>  the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected </s>
<s>  there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into
silence </s>
<s>  and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him </s>
<s>  bingley of course returned with him to dinner </s>
<s> 
and in the evening <abvr> bennets invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter </s>
<s>  elizabeth who had a letter
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea </s>
<s> 
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes </s>
<s> 

but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her </s>
<s>  on opening the door she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in
earnest conversation </s>
<s>  and had this led to no suspicion the faces of
both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would
have told it all </s>
<s>  their situation was awkward enough </s>
<s>  but hers she
thought was still worse </s>
<s>  not a syllable was uttered by either </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few
words to her sister ran out of the room </s>
<s> 

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give
pleasure </s>
<s>  and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world </s>
<s> 

�tis too much </s>
<s>  she added by far too much </s>
<s>  i do not deserve it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
why is not everybody as happy </s>
<s> 

elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth
a delight which words could but poorly express </s>
<s>  every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane </s>
<s>  but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be
said for the present </s>
<s> 

i must go instantly to my mother </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s>  i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude </s>
<s>  or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself </s>
<s>  he is gone to my father already </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  lizzy to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family </s>
<s>  how shall i bear so much happiness </s>
<s> 

she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the
card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty </s>
<s> 

elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation </s>
<s> 

and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious
circumspection </s>
<s>  of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance </s>
<s>  the
happiest wisest most reasonable end </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose </s>
<s> 

where is your sister </s>
<s>  said he hastily as he opened the door </s>
<s> 

with my mother up stairs </s>
<s>  she will be down in a moment i dare say </s>
<s> 

he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister </s>
<s>  elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship </s>
<s>  they shook hands with
great cordiality </s>
<s>  and then till her sister came down she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections </s>
<s> 
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself </s>
<s> 

it was an evening of no common delight to them all </s>
<s>  the satisfaction of
miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as
made her look handsomer than ever </s>
<s>  kitty simpered and smiled and hoped
her turn was coming soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour </s>
<s>  and when
mr </s>
<s>  bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was </s>
<s> 

not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their
visitor took his leave for the night </s>
<s>  but as soon as he was gone he
turned to his daughter and said </s>
<s> 

jane i congratulate you </s>
<s>  you will be a very happy woman </s>
<s> 

jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his
goodness </s>
<s> 

you are a good girl </s>
<s>  he replied and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled </s>
<s>  i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together </s>
<s>  your tempers are by no means unlike </s>
<s>  you are
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on </s>
<s>  so
easy that every servant will cheat you </s>
<s>  and so generous that you will
always exceed your income </s>
<s> 

i hope not so </s>
<s>  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me </s>
<s> 

exceed their income </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> bennet cried his wife what are you
talking of </s>
<s>  why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely
more </s>
<s>  then addressing her daughter oh </s>
<s>  my dear dear jane i am so
happy </s>
<s>  i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night </s>
<s>  i knew how it
would be </s>
<s>  i always said it must be so at last </s>
<s>  i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing </s>
<s>  i remember as soon as ever i saw him when
he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was
that you should come together </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen </s>
<s> 

wickham lydia were all forgotten </s>
<s>  jane was beyond competition her
favourite child </s>
<s>  at that moment she cared for no other </s>
<s>  her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense </s>
<s> 

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield </s>
<s>  and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter </s>
<s> 

bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn </s>
<s> 
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after
supper </s>
<s>  unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough
detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister </s>
<s>  for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else </s>
<s> 
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur </s>
<s>  in the absence of jane he
always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of
her </s>
<s>  and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of
relief </s>
<s> 

he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring </s>
<s>  i had not believed
it possible </s>
<s> 

i suspected as much replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but how did he account for
it </s>
<s> 

it must have been his sisters doing </s>
<s>  they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects </s>
<s>  but when they see
as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again </s>
<s>  though we
can never be what we once were to each other </s>
<s> 

that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever
heard you utter </s>
<s>  good girl </s>
<s>  it would vex me indeed to see you again
the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard </s>
<s> 

would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again </s>
<s> 

he made a little mistake to be sure </s>
<s>  but it is to the credit of his
modesty </s>
<s> 

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and
the little value he put on his own good qualities </s>
<s>  elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend </s>
<s>  for
though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him </s>
<s> 

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed </s>
<s>  cried
jane </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed
above them all </s>
<s>  if i could but see you as happy </s>
<s>  if there were but
such another man for you </s>
<s> 

if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as
you </s>
<s>  till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your
happiness </s>
<s>  no no let me shift for myself </s>
<s>  and perhaps if i have very
good luck i may meet with another <abvr> collins in time </s>
<s> 

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was privileged to whisper it to <abvr> phillips
and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton </s>
<s> 

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune </s>
<s> 



chapter 


one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been
formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage </s>
<s>  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn </s>
<s>  it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours </s>
<s>  the horses
were post </s>
<s>  and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it were familiar to them </s>
<s>  as it was certain however that
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the
shrubbery </s>
<s>  they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered </s>
<s>  it was lady catherine de bourgh </s>
<s> 

they were of course all intending to be surprised </s>
<s>  but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation </s>
<s>  and on the part of <abvr>
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even
inferior to what elizabeth felt </s>
<s> 

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no
other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the
head and sat down without saying a word </s>
<s>  elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of
introduction had been made </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance received her with the utmost politeness </s>
<s>  after sitting
for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth

i hope you are well miss bennet </s>
<s>  that lady i suppose is your
mother </s>
<s> 

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was </s>
<s> 

and that i suppose is one of your sisters </s>
<s> 

yes madam said <abvr> bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine </s>
<s> 
she is my youngest girl but one </s>
<s>  my youngest of all is lately married
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man
who i believe will soon become a part of the family </s>
<s> 

you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short
silence </s>
<s> 

it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say </s>
<s>  but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass </s>
<s> 

this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in
summer </s>
<s>  the windows are full west </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then
added </s>
<s> 

may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  collins well </s>
<s> 

yes very well </s>
<s>  i saw them the night before last </s>
<s> 

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling </s>
<s>  but no
letter appeared and she was completely puzzled </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment </s>
<s>  but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely
declined eating anything </s>
<s>  and then rising up said to elizabeth

miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn </s>
<s>  i should be glad to take a turn in it if you
will favour me with your company </s>
<s> 

go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the
different walks </s>
<s>  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage </s>
<s> 

elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol
attended her noble guest downstairs </s>
<s>  as they passed through the
hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and
drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent
looking rooms walked on </s>
<s> 

her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her
waitingwoman was in it </s>
<s>  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse </s>
<s>  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

how could i ever think her like her nephew </s>
<s>  said she as she looked in
her face </s>
<s> 

as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following
manner </s>
<s> 

you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my
journey hither </s>
<s>  your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i
come </s>
<s> 

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment </s>
<s> 

indeed you are mistaken madam </s>
<s>  i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here </s>
<s> 

miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with </s>
<s>  but however insincere you may
choose to be you shall not find me so </s>
<s>  my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it </s>
<s>  a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago </s>
<s>  i was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  though i
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved
on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to
you </s>
<s> 

if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far </s>
<s>  what could your ladyship propose by it </s>
<s> 

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted </s>
<s> 

your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it </s>
<s>  if indeed such a report
is in existence </s>
<s> 

if </s>
<s>  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it </s>
<s>  has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves </s>
<s>  do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad </s>
<s> 

i never heard that it was </s>
<s> 

and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it </s>
<s> 

i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship </s>
<s>  you may
ask questions which i shall not choose to answer </s>
<s> 

this is not to be borne </s>
<s>  miss bennet i insist on being satisfied </s>
<s>  has
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage </s>
<s> 

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible </s>
<s> 

it ought to be so </s>
<s>  it must be so while he retains the use of his
reason </s>
<s>  but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family </s>
<s>  you
may have drawn him in </s>
<s> 

if i have i shall be the last person to confess it </s>
<s> 

miss bennet do you know who i am </s>
<s>  i have not been accustomed to such
language as this </s>
<s>  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns </s>
<s> 

but you are not entitled to know mine </s>
<s>  nor will such behaviour as this
ever induce me to be explicit </s>
<s> 

let me be rightly understood </s>
<s>  this match to which you have the
presumption to aspire can never take place </s>
<s>  no never </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy is
engaged to my daughter </s>
<s>  now what have you to say </s>
<s> 

only this </s>
<s>  that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me </s>
<s> 

lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied </s>
<s> 

the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind </s>
<s>  from their infancy
they have been intended for each other </s>
<s>  it was the favourite wish of
his mother as well as of hers </s>
<s>  while in their cradles we planned
the union </s>
<s>  and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to
the family </s>
<s>  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends </s>
<s>  to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy </s>
<s>  have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin </s>
<s> 

yes and i had heard it before </s>
<s>  but what is that to me </s>
<s>  if there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry miss de bourgh </s>
<s>  you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage </s>
<s>  its completion depended on others </s>
<s>  if <abvr> darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make
another choice </s>
<s>  and if i am that choice why may not i accept him </s>
<s> 

because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it </s>
<s>  yes
miss bennet interest </s>
<s>  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all </s>
<s>  you will
be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him </s>
<s> 
your alliance will be a disgrace </s>
<s>  your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us </s>
<s> 

these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth </s>
<s>  but the wife of <abvr>
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause
to repine </s>
<s> 

obstinate headstrong girl </s>
<s>  i am ashamed of you </s>
<s>  is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring </s>
<s>  is nothing due to me on that
score </s>
<s>  let us sit down </s>
<s>  you are to understand miss bennet that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose </s>
<s>  nor will
i be dissuaded from it </s>
<s>  i have not been used to submit to any persons
whims </s>
<s>  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment </s>
<s> 

that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable </s>
<s> 
but it will have no effect on me </s>
<s> 

i will not be interrupted </s>
<s>  hear me in silence </s>
<s>  my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other </s>
<s>  they are descended on the maternal
side from the same noble line </s>
<s>  and on the fathers from respectable
honourable and ancientthough untitledfamilies </s>
<s>  their fortune on
both sides is splendid </s>
<s>  they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses </s>
<s>  and what is to divide them </s>
<s> 
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections
or fortune </s>
<s>  is this to be endured </s>
<s>  but it must not shall not be </s>
<s>  if you
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up </s>
<s> 

in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere </s>
<s>  he is a gentleman </s>
<s>  i am a gentlemans daughter </s>
<s>  so far we are
equal </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s>  you are a gentlemans daughter </s>
<s>  but who was your mother </s>
<s> 
who are your uncles and aunts </s>
<s>  do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition </s>
<s> 

whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does
not object to them they can be nothing to you </s>
<s> 

tell me once for all are you engaged to him </s>
<s> 

though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a
moments deliberation </s>
<s> 

i am not </s>
<s> 

lady catherine seemed pleased </s>
<s> 

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement </s>
<s> 

i will make no promise of the kind </s>
<s> 

miss bennet i am shocked and astonished </s>
<s>  i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman </s>
<s>  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that
i will ever recede </s>
<s>  i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require </s>
<s> 

and i certainly never shall give it </s>
<s>  i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable </s>
<s>  your ladyship wants <abvr> darcy to marry
your daughter </s>
<s>  but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their
marriage at all more probable </s>
<s>  supposing him to be attached to me would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin </s>
<s> 
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was illjudged </s>
<s>  you have widely mistaken my character if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these </s>
<s>  how far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell </s>
<s> 
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine </s>
<s>  i must beg
therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject </s>
<s> 

not so hasty if you please </s>
<s>  i have by no means done </s>
<s>  to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add </s>
<s>  i am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous
elopement </s>
<s>  i know it all </s>
<s>  that the young mans marrying her was a
patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles </s>
<s>  and is
such a girl to be my nephews sister </s>

you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered </s>

you have insulted me in every possible method </s>

the house </s>
<s> 

and she rose as she spoke </s>
<s>  lady catherine rose also and they turned
back </s>
<s>  her ladyship was highly incensed </s>
<s> 

you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew </s>
<s> 
unfeeling selfish girl </s>
<s>  do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody </s>
<s> 

lady catherine i have nothing further to say </s>
<s>  you know my sentiments </s>
<s> 

you are then resolved to have him </s>
<s> 

i have said no such thing </s>
<s>  i am only resolved to act in that manner

would be violated by my marriage with <abvr> darcy </s>

i shall now know how to act </s>
<s>  do not imagine miss bennet that your

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave
of you miss bennet </s>

no such attention </s>

elizabeth made no answer </s>

heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs </s>
<s>  her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself </s>
<s> 

she did not choose it said her daughter she would go </s>

she is a very finelooking woman </s>

chapter 


the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome </s>
<s>  nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly </s>
<s>  lady catherine it
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <abvr>
darcy </s>
<s>  it was a rational scheme to be sure </s>
<s>  but from what the report
of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine </s>
<s> 
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply
the idea </s>
<s>  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together </s>
<s>  and her neighbours
at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time </s>
<s> 

in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference </s>
<s>  from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew </s>
<s>  and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce </s>
<s>  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do </s>
<s>  and it
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would
address him on his weakest side </s>
<s>  with his notions of dignity he would
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning </s>
<s> 

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often
seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him </s>
<s>  in that case he would return no more </s>
<s>  lady
catherine might see him in her way through town </s>
<s>  and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way </s>
<s> 

if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand
it </s>
<s>  i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his
constancy </s>
<s>  if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him
at all </s>
<s> 

                              

the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had
been was very great </s>
<s>  but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased <abvr> bennets curiosity </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject </s>
<s> 

the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her
father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand </s>
<s> 

lizzy said he i was going to look for you </s>
<s>  come into my room </s>
<s> 

she followed him thither </s>
<s>  and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held </s>
<s>  it suddenly struck her that it
might be from lady catherine </s>
<s>  and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations </s>
<s> 

she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down </s>
<s>  he
then said

i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly </s>
<s>  as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its
contents </s>
<s>  i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony </s>
<s>  let me congratulate you on a very important conquest </s>
<s> 

the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt </s>
<s> 
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself </s>
<s>  when her father continued </s>
<s> 

you look conscious </s>
<s>  young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these </s>
<s>  but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer </s>
<s>  this letter is from <abvr> collins </s>
<s> 

from <abvr> collins </s>
<s>  and what can he have to say </s>
<s> 

something very much to the purpose of course </s>
<s>  he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of
which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping
lucases </s>
<s>  i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point </s>
<s>  what relates to yourself is as follows </s>
<s>  �having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of <abvr> collins and myself on
this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another </s>
<s> 
of which we have been advertised by the same authority </s>
<s>  your daughter
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land </s>
<s> 

can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this </s>
<s>  �this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive
patronage </s>
<s>  yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin
elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of </s>
<s> 

have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is </s>
<s>  but now it comes out </s>
<s> 

�my motive for cautioning you is as follows </s>
<s>  we have reason to imagine
that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with
a friendly eye </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy you see is the man </s>
<s>  now lizzy i think i have
surprised you </s>
<s>  could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his
life </s>
<s>  it is admirable </s>
<s> 

elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force
one most reluctant smile </s>
<s>  never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her </s>
<s> 

are you not diverted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  pray read on </s>
<s> 

�after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she
felt on the occasion </s>
<s>  when it became apparent that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match </s>
<s>  i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned </s>
<s>  <abvr>
collins moreover adds �i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad
business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known </s>
<s>  i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married </s>
<s>  it was an
encouragement of vice </s>
<s>  and had i been the rector of longbourn i should
very strenuously have opposed it </s>
<s>  you ought certainly to forgive them
as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing </s>
<s>  that is his notion of christian
forgiveness </s>
<s>  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes
situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch </s>
<s>  but lizzy you
look as if you did not enjoy it </s>
<s>  you are not going to be missish
i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report </s>
<s>  for what do we
live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our
turn </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted </s>
<s>  but it is so
strange </s>
<s> 

yesthat is what makes it amusing </s>
<s>  had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing </s>
<s>  but his perfect indifference and your
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd </s>
<s>  much as i abominate
writing i would not give up <abvr> collinss correspondence for any
consideration </s>
<s>  nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my soninlaw </s>
<s>  and pray lizzy what said lady catherine
about this report </s>
<s>  did she call to refuse her consent </s>
<s> 

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh </s>
<s>  and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by
his repeating it </s>
<s>  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not </s>
<s>  it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried </s>
<s>  her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of <abvr> darcys indifference and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of
his seeing too little she might have fancied too much </s>
<s> 



chapter 


instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as
elizabeth half expected <abvr> bingley to do he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines
visit </s>
<s>  the gentlemen arrived early </s>
<s>  and before <abvr> bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed
their all walking out </s>
<s>  it was agreed to </s>
<s>  <abvr> bennet was not in the
habit of walking </s>
<s>  mary could never spare time </s>
<s>  but the remaining five
set off together </s>
<s>  bingley and jane however soon allowed the others
to outstrip them </s>
<s>  they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy
were to entertain each other </s>
<s>  very little was said by either </s>
<s>  kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk </s>
<s>  elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution </s>
<s>  and perhaps he might be doing the same </s>
<s> 

they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon
maria </s>
<s>  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone </s>
<s>  now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was
high she immediately said </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcy i am a very selfish creature </s>
<s>  and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours </s>
<s>  i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister </s>
<s>  ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it </s>
<s>  were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express </s>
<s> 

i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a
mistaken light have given you uneasiness </s>
<s>  i did not think <abvr> gardiner
was so little to be trusted </s>
<s> 

you must not blame my aunt </s>
<s>  lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter </s>
<s>  and of course i could
not rest till i knew the particulars </s>
<s>  let me thank you again and again
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the
sake of discovering them </s>
<s> 

if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone </s>
<s> 
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny </s>
<s>  but your
family owe me nothing </s>
<s>  much as i respect them i believe i thought
only of you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word </s>
<s>  after a short pause
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me </s>
<s>  if your
feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once </s>
<s>  my
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever </s>
<s> 

elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation now forced herself to speak </s>
<s>  and immediately though not
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances </s>
<s>  the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before </s>
<s>  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do </s>
<s>  had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him </s>
<s> 
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his
affection every moment more valuable </s>
<s> 

they walked on without knowing in what direction </s>
<s>  there was too much to
be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects </s>
<s>  she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth </s>
<s>  dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance </s>
<s>  in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give </s>
<s>  but unluckily for her
ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise </s>
<s> 

it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before </s>
<s>  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly </s>
<s> 

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of that </s>
<s>  after abusing you so
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations </s>
<s> 

what did you say of me that i did not deserve </s>
<s>  for though your
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof </s>
<s>  it was
unpardonable </s>
<s>  i cannot think of it without abhorrence </s>
<s> 

we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening said elizabeth </s>
<s>  the conduct of neither if strictly examined
will be irreproachable </s>
<s>  but since then we have both i hope improved
in civility </s>
<s> 

i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself </s>
<s>  the recollection of what i
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me </s>
<s>  your
reproof so well applied i shall never forget </s>
<s>  �had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner </s>
<s>  those were your words </s>
<s>  you know not you can
scarcely conceive how they have tortured me </s>
<s> though it was some time
i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice </s>
<s> 

i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression </s>
<s>  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way </s>
<s> 

i can easily believe it </s>
<s>  you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling i am sure you did </s>
<s>  the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  do not repeat what i then said </s>
<s>  these recollections will not do at
all </s>
<s>  i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it </s>
<s> 

darcy mentioned his letter </s>
<s>  did it said he did it soon make you
think better of me </s>
<s>  did you on reading it give any credit to its
contents </s>
<s> 

she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed </s>
<s> 

i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was
necessary </s>
<s>  i hope you have destroyed the letter </s>
<s>  there was one part
especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the
power of reading again </s>
<s>  i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me </s>
<s> 

the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard </s>
<s>  but though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily
changed as that implies </s>
<s> 

when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit </s>
<s> 

the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so </s>
<s>  the
adieu is charity itself </s>
<s>  but think no more of the letter </s>
<s>  the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now
so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten </s>
<s>  you must learn some
of my philosophy </s>
<s>  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure </s>
<s> 

i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind </s>
<s>  your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of
innocence </s>
<s>  but with me it is not so </s>
<s>  painful recollections will intrude
which cannot which ought not to be repelled </s>
<s>  i have been a selfish
being all my life in practice though not in principle </s>
<s>  as a child i
was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper </s>
<s>  i
was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit </s>
<s> 
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt
by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all
that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing </s>
<s>  to care for none beyond my own family
circle </s>
<s>  to think meanly of all the rest of the world </s>
<s>  to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own </s>
<s>  such i
was from eight to eight and twenty </s>
<s>  and such i might still have been
but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth </s>
<s>  what do i not owe you </s>
<s>  you
taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous </s>
<s>  by you
i was properly humbled </s>
<s>  i came to you without a doubt of my reception </s>
<s> 
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased </s>
<s> 

had you then persuaded yourself that i should </s>
<s> 

indeed i had </s>
<s>  what will you think of my vanity </s>
<s>  i believed you to be
wishing expecting my addresses </s>
<s> 

my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure
you </s>
<s>  i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me
wrong </s>
<s>  how you must have hated me after that evening </s>
<s> 

hate you </s>
<s>  i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction </s>
<s> 

i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
pemberley </s>
<s>  you blamed me for coming </s>
<s> 

no indeed </s>
<s>  i felt nothing but surprise </s>
<s> 

your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you </s>
<s> 
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due </s>
<s> 

my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in
my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past </s>
<s>  and i hoped to
obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to </s>
<s>  how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you </s>
<s> 

he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption </s>
<s>  which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend </s>
<s> 

she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther </s>
<s> 

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know
anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that
it was time to be at home </s>
<s> 

what could become of <abvr> bingley and jane </s>
<s>  was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs </s>
<s>  darcy was delighted with
their engagement </s>
<s>  his friend had given him the earliest information of
it </s>
<s> 

i must ask whether you were surprised </s>
<s>  said elizabeth </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>  when i went away i felt that it would soon happen </s>
<s> 

that is to say you had given your permission </s>
<s>  i guessed as much </s>
<s>  and
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much
the case </s>
<s> 

on the evening before my going to london said he i made a
confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago </s>
<s>  i
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent </s>
<s>  his surprise was great </s>
<s>  he had never had
the slightest suspicion </s>
<s>  i told him moreover that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent
to him </s>
<s>  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend </s>
<s> 

did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring </s>
<s> 

from the former </s>
<s>  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made here </s>
<s>  and i was convinced of her affection </s>
<s> 

and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to
him </s>
<s> 

it did </s>
<s>  bingley is most unaffectedly modest </s>
<s>  his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy </s>
<s>  i was obliged to confess
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him </s>
<s>  i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him </s>
<s>  he was
angry </s>
<s>  but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sisters sentiments </s>
<s>  he has heartily forgiven me
now </s>
<s> 

elizabeth longed to observe that <abvr> bingley had been a most delightful
friend </s>
<s>  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable </s>
<s>  but she checked
herself </s>
<s>  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at
and it was rather too early to begin </s>
<s>  in anticipating the happiness
of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he
continued the conversation till they reached the house </s>
<s>  in the hall they
parted </s>
<s> 



chapter 


my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to </s>
<s>  was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room
and from all the others when they sat down to table </s>
<s>  she had only to
say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge </s>
<s>  she coloured as she spoke </s>
<s>  but neither that nor anything
else awakened a suspicion of the truth </s>
<s> 

the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary </s>
<s>  the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent </s>
<s> 
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth </s>
<s> 
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy
than felt herself to be so </s>
<s>  for besides the immediate embarrassment
there were other evils before her </s>
<s>  she anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known </s>
<s>  she was aware that no
one liked him but jane </s>
<s>  and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away </s>
<s> 

at night she opened her heart to jane </s>
<s>  though suspicion was very far
from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here </s>
<s> 

you are joking lizzy </s>
<s>  this cannot be </s>
<s> engaged to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  no no
you shall not deceive me </s>
<s>  i know it to be impossible </s>
<s> 

this is a wretched beginning indeed </s>
<s>  my sole dependence was on you </s>
<s>  and
i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not </s>
<s>  yet indeed i am
in earnest </s>
<s>  i speak nothing but the truth </s>
<s>  he still loves me and we are
engaged </s>
<s> 

jane looked at her doubtingly </s>
<s>  oh lizzy </s>
<s>  it cannot be </s>
<s>  i know how much
you dislike him </s>
<s> 

you know nothing of the matter </s>
<s>  that is all to be forgot </s>
<s>  perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now </s>
<s>  but in such cases as
these a good memory is unpardonable </s>
<s>  this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself </s>
<s> 

miss bennet still looked all amazement </s>
<s>  elizabeth again and more
seriously assured her of its truth </s>
<s> 

good heaven </s>
<s>  can it be really so </s>
<s>  yet now i must believe you cried
jane </s>
<s>  my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you
certain </s>
<s>  forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be
happy with him </s>
<s> 

there can be no doubt of that </s>
<s>  it is settled between us already that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world </s>
<s>  but are you pleased
jane </s>
<s>  shall you like to have such a brother </s>
<s> 

very very much </s>
<s>  nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight </s>
<s>  but we considered it we talked of it as impossible </s>
<s>  and do you
really love him quite well enough </s>
<s>  oh lizzy </s>
<s>  do anything rather than
marry without affection </s>
<s>  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i
tell you all </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s> 

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley </s>
<s>  i am
afraid you will be angry </s>
<s> 

my dearest sister now be serious </s>
<s>  i want to talk very seriously </s>
<s>  let
me know every thing that i am to know without delay </s>
<s>  will you tell me
how long you have loved him </s>
<s> 

it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began </s>
<s> 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley </s>
<s> 

another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the
desired effect </s>
<s>  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment </s>
<s>  when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing
further to wish </s>
<s> 

now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself </s>
<s> 
i always had a value for him </s>
<s>  were it for nothing but his love of you
i must always have esteemed him </s>
<s>  but now as bingleys friend and your
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me </s>
<s>  but
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me </s>
<s>  how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton </s>
<s>  i owe all that i know
of it to another not to you </s>
<s> 

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy </s>
<s>  she had been unwilling
to mention bingley </s>
<s>  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend </s>
<s>  but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage </s>
<s>  all was acknowledged
and half the night spent in conversation </s>
<s> 

                              

good gracious </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> bennet as she stood at a window the next
morning if that disagreeable <abvr> darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley </s>
<s>  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here </s>
<s>  i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or
other and not disturb us with his company </s>
<s>  what shall we do with him </s>
<s> 
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys
way </s>
<s> 

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal </s>
<s>  yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet </s>
<s> 

as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information </s>
<s> 
and he soon afterwards said aloud <abvr> bennet have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today </s>
<s> 

i advise <abvr> darcy and lizzy and kitty said <abvr> bennet to walk
to oakham mount this morning </s>
<s>  it is a nice long walk and <abvr> darcy has
never seen the view </s>
<s> 

it may do very well for the others replied <abvr> bingley </s>
<s>  but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty </s>
<s>  wont it kitty </s>
<s>  kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home </s>
<s>  darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented </s>
<s>  as she went
up stairs to get ready <abvr> bennet followed her saying </s>
<s> 

i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself </s>
<s>  but i hope you will not mind it </s>
<s>  it is
all for janes sake you know </s>
<s>  and there is no occasion for talking
to him except just now and then </s>
<s>  so do not put yourself to
inconvenience </s>
<s> 

during their walk it was resolved that <abvr> bennets consent should be
asked in the course of the evening </s>
<s>  elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mothers </s>
<s>  she could not determine how her mother
would take it </s>
<s>  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man </s>
<s>  but whether she
were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense </s>
<s>  and she could no more bear that <abvr> darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation </s>
<s> 

                              

in the evening soon after <abvr> bennet withdrew to the library she saw
mr </s>
<s>  darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme </s>
<s>  she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to
be made unhappy </s>
<s>  and that it should be through her meansthat she
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched
reflection and she sat in misery till <abvr> darcy appeared again when
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile </s>
<s>  in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty </s>
<s>  and while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he
wants you in the library </s>
<s>  she was gone directly </s>
<s> 

her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious </s>
<s> 
lizzy said he what are you doing </s>
<s>  are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man </s>
<s>  have not you always hated him </s>
<s> 

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable her expressions more moderate </s>
<s>  it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give </s>
<s> 
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion
of her attachment to <abvr> darcy </s>
<s> 

or in other words you are determined to have him </s>
<s>  he is rich to be
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane </s>
<s> 
but will they make you happy </s>
<s> 

have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my
indifference </s>
<s> 

none at all </s>
<s>  we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man </s>
<s>  but
this would be nothing if you really liked him </s>
<s> 

i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him </s>
<s> 
indeed he has no improper pride </s>
<s>  he is perfectly amiable </s>
<s>  you do not
know what he really is </s>
<s>  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms </s>
<s> 

lizzy said her father i have given him my consent </s>
<s>  he is the kind
of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he
condescended to ask </s>
<s>  i now give it to you if you are resolved on
having him </s>
<s>  but let me advise you to think better of it </s>
<s>  i know
your disposition lizzy </s>
<s>  i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband </s>
<s>  unless you looked
up to him as a superior </s>
<s>  your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage </s>
<s>  you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery </s>
<s>  my child let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life </s>
<s>  you know not what you are
about </s>
<s> 

elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply </s>
<s>  and
at length by repeated assurances that <abvr> darcy was really the object
of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months
suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did
conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match </s>
<s> 

well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to
say </s>
<s>  if this be the case he deserves you </s>
<s>  i could not have parted with
you my lizzy to anyone less worthy </s>
<s> 

to complete the favourable impression she then told him what <abvr> darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia </s>
<s>  he heard her with astonishment </s>
<s> 

this is an evening of wonders indeed </s>
<s>  and so darcy did every thing </s>
<s> 
made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him
his commission </s>
<s>  so much the better </s>
<s>  it will save me a world of trouble
and economy </s>
<s>  had it been your uncles doing i must and would have
paid him </s>
<s>  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way </s>
<s>  i shall offer to pay him tomorrow </s>
<s>  he will rant and storm about
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter </s>
<s> 

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr </s>
<s>  collinss letter </s>
<s>  and after laughing at her some time allowed her
at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure </s>
<s> 

elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight </s>
<s>  and after
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure </s>
<s>  every thing was too recent for
gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away </s>
<s>  there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time </s>
<s> 

when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her
and made the important communication </s>
<s>  its effect was most extraordinary </s>
<s> 
for on first hearing it <abvr> bennet sat quite still and unable to
utter a syllable </s>
<s>  nor was it under many many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard </s>
<s>  though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them </s>
<s>  she began at length to recover to fidget about in
her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself </s>
<s> 

good gracious </s>
<s>  lord bless me </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s>  dear me </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  who would
have thought it </s>
<s>  and is it really true </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  my sweetest lizzy </s>
<s>  how rich
and how great you will be </s>
<s>  what pinmoney what jewels what carriages
you will have </s>
<s>  janes is nothing to itnothing at all </s>
<s>  i am so
pleasedso happy </s>
<s>  such a charming man </s>
<s> so handsome </s>
<s>  so tall </s>
<s> oh my
dear lizzy </s>
<s>  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before </s>
<s>  i
hope he will overlook it </s>
<s>  dear dear lizzy </s>
<s>  a house in town </s>
<s>  every thing
that is charming </s>
<s>  three daughters married </s>
<s>  ten thousand a year </s>
<s>  oh
lord </s>
<s>  what will become of me </s>
<s>  i shall go distracted </s>
<s> 

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself
soon went away </s>
<s>  but before she had been three minutes in her own room
her mother followed her </s>
<s> 

my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else </s>
<s>  ten
thousand a year and very likely more </s>
<s>  �tis as good as a lord </s>
<s>  and a
special licence </s>
<s>  you must and shall be married by a special licence </s>
<s>  but
my dearest love tell me what dish <abvr> darcy is particularly fond of
that i may have it tomorrow </s>
<s> 

this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be </s>
<s>  and elizabeth found that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations
consent there was still something to be wished for </s>
<s>  but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected </s>
<s>  for <abvr> bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to
him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her
deference for his opinion </s>
<s> 

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him </s>
<s>  and <abvr> bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem </s>
<s> 

i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he </s>
<s>  wickham perhaps
is my favourite </s>
<s>  but i think i shall like your husband quite as well
as janes </s>
<s> 



chapter 


elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted <abvr>
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her </s>
<s>  how could
you begin </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  i can comprehend your going on charmingly when
you had once made a beginning </s>
<s>  but what could set you off in the first
place </s>
<s> 

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which
laid the foundation </s>
<s>  it is too long ago </s>
<s>  i was in the middle before i
knew that i had begun </s>
<s> 

my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not </s>
<s>  now be sincere </s>
<s> 
did you admire me for my impertinence </s>
<s> 

for the liveliness of your mind i did </s>
<s> 

you may as well call it impertinence at once </s>
<s>  it was very little less </s>
<s> 
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious
attention </s>
<s>  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking and thinking for your approbation alone </s>
<s>  i roused and
interested you because i was so unlike them </s>
<s>  had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it </s>
<s>  but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just </s>
<s>  and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you </s>
<s>  therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it </s>
<s>  and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable </s>
<s>  to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks
of that when they fall in love </s>
<s> 

was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was
ill at netherfield </s>
<s> 

dearest jane </s>
<s>  who could have done less for her </s>
<s>  but make a virtue of it
by all means </s>
<s>  my good qualities are under your protection and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible </s>
<s>  and in return it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be </s>
<s>  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last </s>
<s>  what made you so shy of me when you first
called and afterwards dined here </s>
<s>  why especially when you called did
you look as if you did not care about me </s>
<s> 

because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement </s>
<s> 

but i was embarrassed </s>
<s> 

and so was i </s>
<s> 

you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner </s>
<s> 

a man who had felt less might </s>
<s> 

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it </s>
<s>  but i wonder how long you
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself </s>
<s>  i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not asked you </s>
<s>  my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect </s>
<s> 
too much i am afraid </s>
<s>  for what becomes of the moral if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise </s>
<s>  for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject </s>
<s>  this will never do </s>
<s> 

you need not distress yourself </s>
<s>  the moral will be perfectly fair </s>
<s>  lady
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts </s>
<s>  i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude </s>
<s>  i was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours </s>
<s>  my aunts intelligence had given me
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing </s>
<s> 

lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy
for she loves to be of use </s>
<s>  but tell me what did you come down to
netherfield for </s>
<s>  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed </s>
<s> 
or had you intended any more serious consequence </s>
<s> 

my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i
might ever hope to make you love me </s>
<s>  my avowed one or what i avowed to
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made </s>
<s> 

shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her </s>
<s> 

i am more likely to want more time than courage elizabeth </s>
<s>  but it
ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be
done directly </s>
<s> 

and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did </s>
<s>  but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected </s>
<s> 

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <abvr> darcy
had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered <abvr> gardiners
long letter </s>
<s>  but now having that to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as
follows </s>
<s> 

i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done
for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars </s>
<s>  but to say the
truth i was too cross to write </s>
<s>  you supposed more than really existed </s>
<s> 
but now suppose as much as you choose </s>
<s>  give a loose rein to your
fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you
cannot greatly err </s>
<s>  you must write again very soon and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last </s>
<s>  i thank you again and again
for not going to the lakes </s>
<s>  how could i be so silly as to wish it </s>
<s>  your
idea of the ponies is delightful </s>
<s>  we will go round the park every day </s>
<s>  i
am the happiest creature in the world </s>
<s>  perhaps other people have said so
before but not one with such justice </s>
<s>  i am happier even than jane </s>
<s>  she
only smiles i laugh </s>
<s>  <abvr> darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me </s>
<s>  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas </s>
<s> 
yours etc </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style </s>
<s>  and still
different from either was what <abvr> bennet sent to <abvr> collins in reply
to his last </s>
<s> 

dear sir

i must trouble you once more for congratulations </s>
<s>  elizabeth will soon
be the wife of <abvr> darcy </s>
<s>  console lady catherine as well as you can </s>
<s> 
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew </s>
<s>  he has more to give </s>
<s> 

yours sincerely etc </s>
<s> 

miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere </s>
<s>  she wrote even
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her
former professions of regard </s>
<s>  jane was not deceived but she was
affected </s>
<s>  and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved </s>
<s> 

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information
was as sincere as her brothers in sending it </s>
<s>  four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister </s>
<s> 

before any answer could arrive from <abvr> collins or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge </s>
<s>  the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident </s>
<s>  lady catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that
charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over </s>
<s>  at such a moment the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she
saw <abvr> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband </s>
<s>  he bore it however with admirable calmness </s>
<s>  he could even
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st </s>
<s>  jamess with very decent composure </s>
<s>  if he did
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance </s>
<s>  and though <abvr> phillips as well as her sister stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good
humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar </s>
<s> 
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all
likely to make her more elegant </s>
<s>  elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification </s>
<s>  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it
added to the hope of the future </s>
<s>  and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley </s>
<s> 



chapter 


happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <abvr> bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters </s>
<s>  with what delighted pride
she afterwards visited <abvr> bingley and talked of <abvr> darcy may
be guessed </s>
<s>  i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible
amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life </s>
<s>  though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly </s>
<s>  his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do </s>
<s>  he delighted in
going to pemberley especially when he was least expected </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
his easy temper or her affectionate heart </s>
<s>  the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified </s>
<s>  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other </s>
<s> 

kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters </s>
<s>  in society so superior to what she had generally
known her improvement was great </s>
<s>  she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia </s>
<s>  and removed from the influence of lydias example
she became by proper attention and management less irritable less
ignorant and less insipid </s>
<s>  from the further disadvantage of lydias
society she was of course carefully kept and though <abvr> wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of
balls and young men her father would never consent to her going </s>
<s> 

mary was the only daughter who remained at home </s>
<s>  and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <abvr> bennets being quite
unable to sit alone </s>
<s>  mary was obliged to mix more with the world but
she could still moralize over every morning visit </s>
<s>  and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance </s>
<s> 

as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters </s>
<s>  he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her </s>
<s>  and in spite of every
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune </s>
<s>  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least
if not by himself such a hope was cherished </s>
<s>  the letter was to this
effect </s>
<s> 

my dear lizzy

i wish you joy </s>
<s>  if you love <abvr> darcy half as well as i do my dear
wickham you must be very happy </s>
<s>  it is a great comfort to have you so
rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us </s>
<s> 
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help </s>
<s> 
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year </s>
<s>  but however
do not speak to <abvr> darcy about it if you had rather not </s>
<s> 

yours etc </s>
<s> 

as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind </s>
<s> 
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she
frequently sent them </s>
<s>  it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to
their support </s>
<s>  and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills </s>
<s>  their manner of living even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the
extreme </s>
<s>  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation and always spending more than they ought </s>
<s>  his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference </s>
<s>  hers lasted a little longer </s>
<s>  and
in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her </s>
<s> 

though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for
elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession </s>
<s>  lydia was
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath </s>
<s>  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone </s>
<s> 

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage </s>
<s>  but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she
dropt all her resentment </s>
<s>  was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth </s>
<s> 

pemberley was now georgianas home </s>
<s>  and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see </s>
<s>  they were able to love each
other even as well as they intended </s>
<s>  georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth </s>
<s>  though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of
talking to her brother </s>
<s>  he who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open
pleasantry </s>
<s>  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way </s>
<s>  by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not

precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printers

esq </s>

accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife </s>

family in the usual terms </s>

<s> 

heir presumptive william walter elliot esq </s>
<s>  great grandson of the
second sir walter </s>
<s> 

vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliots character </s>
<s> 
vanity of person and of situation </s>
<s>   he had been remarkably handsome in
his youth </s>
<s>  and at fiftyfour was still a very fine man </s>
<s>   few women
could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could
the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held
in society </s>
<s>   he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to
the blessing of a baronetcy </s>
<s>  and the sir walter elliot who united
these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and
devotion </s>
<s> 

his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment </s>
<s>  since
to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any
thing deserved by his own </s>
<s>   lady elliot had been an excellent woman
sensible and amiable </s>
<s>  whose judgement and conduct if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never
required indulgence afterwards </s>
<s> she had humoured or softened or
concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for
seventeen years </s>
<s>  and though not the very happiest being in the world
herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children
to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her
when she was called on to quit them </s>
<s> three girls the two eldest
sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an
awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a
conceited silly father </s>
<s>   she had however one very intimate friend a
sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment
to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch </s>
<s>  and on
her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help
and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had
been anxiously giving her daughters </s>
<s> 

this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance </s>
<s>   thirteen years had
passed away since lady elliots death and they were still near
neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other
a widow </s>
<s> 

that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well
provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no
apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not </s>
<s>  but
sir walters continuing in singleness requires explanation </s>
<s>   be it
known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one
or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake </s>
<s>   for
one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing
which he had not been very much tempted to do </s>
<s>   elizabeth had
succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mothers rights
and consequence </s>
<s>  and being very handsome and very like himself her
influence had always been great and they had gone on together most
happily </s>
<s>   his two other children were of very inferior value </s>
<s>   mary had
acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles
musgrove </s>
<s>  but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
character which must have placed her high with any people of real
understanding was nobody with either father or sister </s>
<s>  her word had no
weight her convenience was always to give wayshe was only anne </s>
<s> 

to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued
goddaughter favourite and friend </s>
<s>   lady russell loved them all </s>
<s>  but
it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again </s>
<s> 

a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her
bloom had vanished early </s>
<s>  and as even in its height her father had
found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate
features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in
them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem </s>
<s>  he had
never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in
any other page of his favourite work </s>
<s>   all equality of alliance must
rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old
country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore
given all the honour and received none </s>
<s>  elizabeth would one day or
other marry suitably </s>
<s> 

it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twentynine than she
was ten years before </s>
<s>  and generally speaking if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely
any charm is lost </s>
<s>   it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter
might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be
deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming
as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else </s>
<s>  for he
could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance
were growing </s>
<s>   anne haggard mary coarse every face in the
neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crows foot about
lady russells temples had long been a distress to him </s>
<s> 

elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment </s>
<s> 
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and
directing with a selfpossession and decision which could never have
given the idea of her being younger than she was </s>
<s>   for thirteen years
had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at
home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking
immediately after lady russell out of all the drawingrooms and
diningrooms in the country </s>
<s>   thirteen winters revolving frosts had
seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood
afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled
up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the
great world </s>
<s>   she had the remembrance of all this she had the
consciousness of being nineandtwenty to give her some regrets and
some apprehensions </s>
<s>  she was fully satisfied of being still quite as
handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and
would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by
baronetblood within the next twelvemonth or two </s>
<s>   then might she again
take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth
but now she liked it not </s>
<s>   always to be presented with the date of her
own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister
made the book an evil </s>
<s>  and more than once when her father had left it
open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and
pushed it away </s>
<s> 

she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially
the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of </s>
<s> 
the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq </s>
<s>  whose
rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed
her </s>
<s> 

she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be
in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to
marry him and her father had always meant that she should </s>
<s>   he had not
been known to them as a boy </s>
<s>  but soon after lady elliots death sir
walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not
been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making
allowance for the modest drawingback of youth </s>
<s>  and in one of their
spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr
elliot had been forced into the introduction </s>
<s> 

he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the
law </s>
<s>  and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his
favour was confirmed </s>
<s>   he was invited to kellynch hall </s>
<s>  he was talked
of and expected all the rest of the year </s>
<s>  but he never came </s>
<s>   the
following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable
again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come </s>
<s>  and
the next tidings were that he was married </s>
<s>   instead of pushing his
fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he
had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of
inferior birth </s>
<s> 

sir walter had resented it </s>
<s>   as the head of the house he felt that he
ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so
publicly by the hand </s>
<s>  for they must have been seen together he
observed once at tattersalls and twice in the lobby of the house of
commons </s>
<s>   his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little
regarded </s>
<s>   mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as
unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter
considered him unworthy of it </s>
<s>   all acquaintance between them had
ceased </s>
<s> 

this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of
several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for
himself and still more for being her fathers heir and whose strong
family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter
elliots eldest daughter </s>
<s>   there was not a baronet from a to z whom her
feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal </s>
<s>   yet so
miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present
time the summer of  wearing black ribbons for his wife she could
not admit him to be worth thinking of again </s>
<s>   the disgrace of his first
marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it
perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse </s>
<s> 
but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they
had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most
slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and
the honours which were hereafter to be his own </s>
<s>   this could not be
pardoned </s>
<s> 

such were elizabeth elliots sentiments and sensations </s>
<s>  such the cares
to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the
prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life </s>
<s>  such the feelings
to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle
to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no
talents or accomplishments for home to occupy </s>
<s> 

but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these </s>
<s>   her father was growing distressed for money </s>
<s>   she
knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the
heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr
shepherd his agent from his thoughts </s>
<s>   the kellynch property was
good but not equal to sir walters apprehension of the state required
in its possessor </s>
<s>   while lady elliot lived there had been method
moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income </s>
<s>  but
with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period he
had been constantly exceeding it </s>
<s>   it had not been possible for him to
spend less </s>
<s>  he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was
imperiously called on to do </s>
<s>  but blameless as he was he was not only
growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it
became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his
daughter </s>
<s>   he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town </s>
<s> 
he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench </s>
<s>   does it occur to
you that there is any one article in which we can retrench </s>
<s>  and
elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm
set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed
these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities
and to refrain from new furnishing the drawingroom </s>
<s>  to which
expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no
present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom </s>
<s>   but these
measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real
extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged
to confess to her soon afterwards </s>
<s>   elizabeth had nothing to propose of
deeper efficacy </s>
<s>   she felt herself illused and unfortunate as did her
father </s>
<s>  and they were neither of them able to devise any means of
lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or
relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne </s>
<s> 

there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose
of </s>
<s>  but had every acre been alienable it would have made no
difference </s>
<s>   he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the
power but he would never condescend to sell </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>  he would never
disgrace his name so far </s>
<s>   the kellynch estate should be transmitted
whole and entire as he had received it </s>
<s> 

their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the
neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them </s>
<s> 
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and
reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence
of taste or pride </s>
<s> 



chapter 


mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold
or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted
by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and
only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully
expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see
finally adopted </s>
<s> 

lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it
much serious consideration </s>
<s>   she was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this
instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles </s>
<s> 
she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour </s>
<s> 
but she was as desirous of saving sir walters feelings as solicitous
for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was
due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be </s>
<s>   she was a
benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments
most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with
manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding </s>
<s>   she had a
cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent </s>
<s> 
but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry </s>
<s>  she had a value for
rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those
who possessed them </s>
<s>   herself the widow of only a knight she gave the
dignity of a baronet all its due </s>
<s>  and sir walter independent of his
claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging
landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and
her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to
a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present
difficulties </s>
<s> 

they must retrench </s>
<s>  that did not admit of a doubt </s>
<s>   but she was very
anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and
elizabeth </s>
<s>  she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations
and she did what nobody else thought of doing </s>
<s>   she consulted anne who
never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the
question </s>
<s>  she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in
marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to
sir walter </s>
<s>  every emendation of annes had been on the side of honesty
against importance </s>
<s>   she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete
reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of
indifference for everything but justice and equity </s>
<s> 

if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell
looking over her paper much may be done </s>
<s>   if he will adopt these
regulations in seven years he will be clear </s>
<s>  and i hope we may be able
to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability
in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions </s>
<s>  and that the
true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the
eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle </s>
<s>   what will
he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have
done or ought to do </s>
<s>   there will be nothing singular in his case </s>
<s>  and
it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as
it always does of our conduct </s>
<s>   i have great hope of prevailing </s>
<s>   we
must be serious and decided </s>
<s>  for after all the person who has
contracted debts must pay them </s>
<s>  and though a great deal is due to the
feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father
there is still more due to the character of an honest man </s>
<s> 

this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be
proceeding his friends to be urging him </s>
<s>   she considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all
the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure
and saw no dignity in anything short of it </s>
<s>   she wanted it to be
prescribed and felt as a duty </s>
<s>   she rated lady russells influence
highly </s>
<s>  and as to the severe degree of selfdenial which her own
conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty
in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation </s>
<s>   her
knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the
sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
both and so on through the whole list of lady russells too gentle
reductions </s>
<s> 

how annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little
consequence </s>
<s>   lady russells had no success at all </s>
<s>  could not be put up
with were not to be borne </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s>  every comfort of life knocked off </s>
<s> 
journeys london servants horses tablecontractions and
restrictions every where </s>
<s>   to live no longer with the decencies even of
a private gentleman </s>
<s>   no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once
than remain in it on such disgraceful terms </s>
<s> 

quit kellynch hall </s>
<s>   the hint was immediately taken up by mr
shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walters
retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done
without a change of abode </s>
<s>   since the idea had been started in the
very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in
confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side </s>
<s>   it did not
appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of
living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient
dignity to support </s>
<s>   in any other place sir walter might judge for
himself </s>
<s>  and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in
whatever way he might choose to model his household </s>
<s> 

sir walter would quit kellynch hall </s>
<s>  and after a very few days more of
doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was
settled and the first outline of this important change made out </s>
<s> 

there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in
the country </s>
<s>   all annes wishes had been for the latter </s>
<s>   a small house
in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russells
society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes
seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her
ambition </s>
<s>   but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something
very opposite from her inclination fixed on </s>
<s>   she disliked bath and
did not think it agreed with her </s>
<s>  and bath was to be her home </s>
<s> 

sir walter had at first thought more of london </s>
<s>  but mr shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to
dissuade him from it and make bath preferred </s>
<s>   it was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament </s>
<s>   he might there be important
at comparatively little expense </s>
<s>   two material advantages of bath over
london had of course been given all their weight </s>
<s>   its more convenient
distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending
some part of every winter there </s>
<s>  and to the very great satisfaction of
lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for
bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should
lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there </s>
<s> 

lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes </s>
<s>   it
would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in
his own neighbourhood </s>
<s>   anne herself would have found the
mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters
feelings they must have been dreadful </s>
<s>   and with regard to annes
dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising
first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school
there after her mothers death </s>
<s>  and secondly from her happening to be
not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards
spent there with herself </s>
<s> 

lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must
suit them all </s>
<s>  and as to her young friends health by passing all the
warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided </s>
<s> 
and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits
good </s>
<s>   anne had been too little from home too little seen </s>
<s>  her spirits
were not high </s>
<s>   a larger society would improve them </s>
<s>   she wanted her to
be more known </s>
<s> 

the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for
sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very
material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the
beginning </s>
<s>   he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the
hands of others </s>
<s>  a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir
walters have found too much </s>
<s>   kellynch hall was to be let </s>
<s>   this
however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own
circle </s>
<s> 

sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to
design letting his house </s>
<s>   mr shepherd had once mentioned the word
advertise but never dared approach it again </s>
<s>   sir walter spurned the
idea of its being offered in any manner </s>
<s>  forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his having such an intention </s>
<s>  and it was only on the
supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour
that he would let it at all </s>
<s> 

how quick come the reasons for approving what we like </s>
<s>   lady russell
had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir
walter and his family were to remove from the country </s>
<s>   elizabeth had
been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted </s>
<s> 
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an
unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with the additional
burden of two children </s>
<s>   she was a clever young woman who understood
the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall </s>
<s> 
and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been
already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady
russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of
caution and reserve </s>
<s> 

lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and
seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because
elizabeth deserved it </s>
<s>   she had never received from her more than
outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance </s>
<s>  had
never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against
previous inclination </s>
<s>   she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying
to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the
injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut
her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth
the advantage of her own better judgement and experience </s>
<s>  but always in
vain </s>
<s>   elizabeth would go her own way </s>
<s>  and never had she pursued it in
more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs
clay </s>
<s>  turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her
affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her
but the object of distant civility </s>
<s> 

from situation mrs clay was in lady russells estimate a very
unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion </s>
<s> 
and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of
more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore an
object of firstrate importance </s>

chapter 


i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one
morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the
present juncture is much in our favour </s>
<s>   this peace will be turning all
our rich naval officers ashore </s>
<s>   they will be all wanting a home </s>
<s> 
could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants
very responsible tenants </s>
<s>   many a noble fortune has been made during
the war </s>
<s>   if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter

he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter </s>
<s>  thats
all i have to remark </s>
<s>   a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him </s>
<s> 
rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many
before </s>
<s>  hey shepherd </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added

i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with </s>
<s>   i have had a little
knowledge of their methods of doing business </s>
<s>  and i am free to confess
that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make
desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with </s>
<s> 
therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if
in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention </s>
<s>  which
must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult
it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the
notice and curiosity of the other </s>
<s>  consequence has its tax </s>
<s>  i john
shepherd might conceal any familymatters that i chose for nobody
would think it worth their while to observe me </s>
<s>  but sir walter elliot
has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude </s>
<s>  and
therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise
me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get
abroad </s>
<s>  in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since
applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our
wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to </s>
<s>  and beg leave
to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the
trouble of replying </s>
<s> 

sir walter only nodded </s>
<s>   but soon afterwards rising and pacing the
room he observed sarcastically

there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description </s>
<s> 

they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune
said mrs clay for mrs clay was present </s>
<s>   her father had driven her
over nothing being of so much use to mrs clays health as a drive to
kellynch </s>
<s>  but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might
be a very desirable tenant </s>

profession </s>

<s>   these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if
you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe </s>
<s>   everything in and
about the house would be taken such excellent care of </s>
<s>   the gardens and
shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now </s>
<s>   you
need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being
neglected </s>
<s> 

as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced
to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the
privileges to be annexed to it </s>
<s>   i am not particularly disposed to
favour a tenant </s>
<s>   the park would be open to him of course and few navy
officers or men of any other description can have had such a range </s>
<s> 
but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the
pleasuregrounds is another thing </s>
<s>   i am not fond of the idea of my
shrubberies being always approachable </s>
<s>  and i should recommend miss
elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden </s>
<s>   i am very
little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary
favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier </s>
<s> 

after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say

in all these cases there are established usages which make everything
plain and easy between landlord and tenant </s>
<s>   your interest sir walter
is in pretty safe hands </s>
<s>   depend upon me for taking care that no tenant
has more than his just rights </s>
<s>   i venture to hint that sir walter
elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be
for him </s>
<s> 

here anne spoke

the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an
equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the
privileges which any home can give </s>
<s>   sailors work hard enough for their
comforts we must all allow </s>
<s> 

very true very true </s>
<s>   what miss anne says is very true was mr
shepherds rejoinder and oh </s>
<s>  certainly was his daughters </s>
<s>  but sir
walters remark was soon afterwards

the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any
friend of mine belonging to it </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  was the reply and with a look of surprise </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  it is in two points offensive to me </s>
<s>  i have two strong grounds of
objection to it </s>
<s>   first as being the means of bringing persons of
obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which
their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of </s>
<s>  and secondly as it
cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly </s>
<s>  a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man </s>
<s>   i have observed it all my life </s>
<s>   a man is
in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one
whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of
becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other
line </s>
<s>   one day last spring in town i was in company with two men
striking instances of what i am talking of </s>
<s>  lord st ives whose father
we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat </s>
<s>  i was
to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most
deplorablelooking personage you can imagine </s>
<s>  his face the colour of
mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree </s>
<s>  all lines and wrinkles
nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top </s>
<s>   in
the name of heaven who is that old fellow </s>
<s>  said i to a friend of mine
who was standing near sir basil morley </s>
<s>   old fellow </s>
<s>  cried sir
basil it is admiral baldwin </s>
<s>   what do you take his age to be </s>
<s> 
sixty said i or perhaps sixtytwo </s>
<s>  forty replied sir basil
forty and no more </s>
<s>   picture to yourselves my amazement </s>
<s>  i shall not
easily forget admiral baldwin </s>
<s>   i never saw quite so wretched an
example of what a seafaring life can do </s>
<s>  but to a degree i know it is
the same with them all </s>
<s>   they are all knocked about and exposed to
every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen </s>
<s>   it
is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach
admiral baldwins age </s>
<s> 

nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed </s>
<s>   have
a little mercy on the poor men </s>
<s>   we are not all born to be handsome </s>
<s> 
the sea is no beautifier certainly </s>
<s>  sailors do grow old betimes </s>
<s>  i
have observed it </s>
<s>  they soon lose the look of youth </s>
<s>   but then is not
it the same with many other professions perhaps most other </s>
<s>   soldiers
in active service are not at all better off </s>
<s>   and even in the quieter
professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the
body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural effect of time </s>
<s> 
the lawyer plods quite careworn </s>
<s>  the physician is up at all hours
and travelling in all weather </s>
<s>  and even the clergyman she stopt a
moment to consider what might do for the clergyman </s>
<s> and even the
clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose
his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere </s>
<s>   in
fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is
necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who
are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the
country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and
living on their own property without the torment of trying for more </s>
<s> 
it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good
appearance to the utmost </s>
<s>  i know no other set of men but what lose
something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young </s>
<s> 

it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walters
good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with
foresight </s>
<s>  for the very first application for the house was from an
admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in
attending the quarter sessions at taunton </s>
<s>  and indeed he had received
a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent </s>
<s>   by the report which
he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of
somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing
to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to
look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which
however had not suited him </s>
<s>  that accidentally hearingit was just as
he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walters concerns could not
be kept a secretaccidentally hearing of the possibility of
kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherds
connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to
make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long
conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man
who knew it only by description could feel </s>
<s>  and given mr shepherd in
his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most
responsible eligible tenant </s>
<s> 

and who is admiral croft </s>
<s>  was sir walters cold suspicious inquiry </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family and
mentioned a place </s>
<s>  and anne after the little pause which followed
added

he is a rear admiral of the white </s>
<s>   he was in the trafalgar action
and has been in the east indies since </s>
<s>  he was stationed there i
believe several years </s>
<s> 

then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is
about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale
hearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure but not
much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour </s>
<s>  not
likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a
comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible </s>

pay for his convenience </s>

consequence might fetch </s>
<s>  should not have been surprised if sir walter
had asked more </s>
<s>  had inquired about the manor </s>
<s>  would be glad of the
deputation certainly but made no great point of it </s>
<s>  said he sometimes
took out a gun but never killed </s>
<s>  quite the gentleman </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject </s>
<s>  pointing out all the
circumstances of the admirals family which made him peculiarly
desirable as a tenant </s>
<s>   he was a married man and without children </s>
<s>  the
very state to be wished for </s>
<s>   a house was never taken good care of mr
shepherd observed without a lady </s>
<s>  he did not know whether furniture
might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as
where there were many children </s>
<s>   a lady without a family was the very
best preserver of furniture in the world </s>
<s>   he had seen mrs croft too </s>
<s> 
she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all
the time they were talking the matter over </s>
<s> 

and a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be
continued he </s>
<s>  asked more questions about the house and terms and
taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with
business </s>
<s>  and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite
unconnected in this country any more than her husband </s>
<s>  that is to say
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once </s>
<s>  she told me
so herself </s>
<s>  sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at
monkford </s>

recollect his name though i have heard it so lately </s>
<s>  penelope my
dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at
monkford </s>
<s>  mrs crofts brother </s>
<s> 

but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not
hear the appeal </s>
<s> 

i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd </s>
<s>  i remember no
gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent </s>
<s> 

bless me </s>
<s>  how very odd </s>
<s>   i shall forget my own name soon i suppose </s>

<s>  wall torn down </s>

fact </s>

amicable compromise </s>
<s>   very odd indeed </s>
<s> 

after waiting another moment

you mean mr wentworth i suppose </s>
<s>  said anne </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd was all gratitude </s>
<s> 

wentworth was the very name </s>
<s>   mr wentworth was the very man </s>
<s>   he had
the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two
or three years </s>
<s>   came there about the year  i take it </s>
<s>   you
remember him i am sure </s>

wentworth </s>

<s>   you misled
me by the term gentleman </s>
<s>   i thought you were speaking of some man of
property </s>
<s>   mr wentworth was nobody i remember </s>
<s>  quite unconnected </s>
<s> 
nothing to do with the strafford family </s>
<s>   one wonders how the names of
many of our nobility become so common </s>
<s> 

as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no
service with sir walter he mentioned it no more </s>
<s>  returning with all
his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their
favour </s>
<s>  their age and number and fortune </s>
<s>  the high idea they had
formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of
renting it </s>
<s>  making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the
happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot </s>
<s>  an extraordinary
taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir
walters estimate of the dues of a tenant </s>
<s> 

it succeeded however </s>
<s>  and though sir walter must ever look with an
evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest
terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the
treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still
remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen </s>
<s> 

sir walter was not very wise </s>
<s>  but still he had experience enough of the
world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials
than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer </s>
<s>   so far went his
understanding </s>
<s>  and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in
the admirals situation in life which was just high enough and not
too high </s>
<s>   i have let my house to admiral croft would sound
extremely well </s>
<s>  very much better than to any mere mr </s>
<s>  a mr save
perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of
explanation </s>
<s>   an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same
time can never make a baronet look small </s>
<s>   in all their dealings and
intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence </s>
<s> 

nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth </s>
<s>  but her
inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to
have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand </s>
<s>  and not a word to
suspend decision was uttered by her </s>
<s> 

mr shepherd was completely empowered to act </s>
<s>  and no sooner had such an
end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to

<s>  involve herself at nineteen in an engagement

such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could
combat </s>

a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance </s>

but not with a few months ended annes share of suffering from it </s>

attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of
youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting
effect </s>

more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful
interest had reached its close </s>

perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too
dependent on time alone </s>
<s>  no aid had been given in change of place

circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he
stood in her memory </s>

natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been

solicited when about twoandtwenty to change her name by the young
man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger

importance were second in that country only to sir walters and of
good character and appearance </s>

asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have
rejoiced to see her at twentytwo so respectably removed from the
partialities and injustice of her fathers house and settled so
permanently near herself </s>
<s>   but in this case anne had left nothing for
advice to do </s>
<s>  and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her
own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the
anxiety which borders on hopelessness for annes being tempted by some
man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held
her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits </s>

anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and
disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in
maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it </s>

happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be

confidence had been justified </s>

follow had taken place </s>

how eloquent could anne elliot have been </s>

her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful
confidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which seems
to insult exertion and distrust providence </s>

prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older </s>

natural sequel of an unnatural beginning </s>

with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not
hear that captain wentworths sister was likely to live at kellynch
without a revival of former pain </s>

were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea </s>
<s>   she often told
herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently

evil </s>
<s>   she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in
the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of
it </s>
<s>   she could do justice to the superiority of lady russells motives
in this over those of her father and elizabeth </s>
<s>  she could honour all
the better feelings of her calmness </s>
<s>  but the general air of oblivion
among them was highly important from whatever it sprung </s>
<s>  and in the
event of admiral crofts really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew
over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the
past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no
syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that
among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had
received any information of their shortlived engagement </s>
<s>   that brother
had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and
moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no
human creatures having heard of it from him </s>
<s> 

the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her
husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at
school while it all occurred </s>
<s>  and never admitted by the pride of some
and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards </s>
<s> 

with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch
and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not
involve any particular awkwardness </s>

chapter 


on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs crofts seeing kellynch
hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady
russells and keep out of the way till all was over </s>
<s>  when she found it
most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing
them </s>
<s> 

this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided
the whole business at once </s>
<s>   each lady was previously well disposed for
an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the
other </s>
<s>  and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good
humour such an open trusting liberality on the admirals side as
could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into
his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherds assurances
of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good
breeding </s>
<s> 

the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were
approved terms time every thing and every body was right </s>
<s>  and mr
shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been a single
preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth </s>
<s> 

sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the
bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should
not be ashamed of being seen with him any where </s>
<s>  and the admiral with
sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through
the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite
of what they told us at taunton </s>
<s>   the baronet will never set the thames
on fire but there seems to be no harm in him </s>
<s> reciprocal
compliments which would have been esteemed about equal </s>
<s> 

the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas </s>
<s>  and as sir walter
proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there
was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement </s>
<s> 

lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any
use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to bath herself after christmas </s>
<s>  but having engagements of
her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was
unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading
the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and
grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the
autumnal months in the country did not think that everything
considered she wished to remain </s>
<s>   it would be most right and most
wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others </s>
<s> 

something occurred however to give her a different duty </s>
<s>   mary often
a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own
complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was
the matter was indisposed </s>
<s>  and foreseeing that she should not have a
days health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it
was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her
company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath </s>
<s> 

i cannot possibly do without anne was marys reasoning </s>
<s>  and
elizabeths reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody
will want her in bath </s>
<s> 

to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all </s>
<s>  and anne glad to be
thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and
certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own
dear country readily agreed to stay </s>
<s> 

this invitation of marys removed all lady russells difficulties and
it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till
lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be
divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge </s>
<s> 

so far all was perfectly right </s>
<s>  but lady russell was almost startled by
the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her
which was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and
elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in
all the business before her </s>
<s>   lady russell was extremely sorry that
such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved
and feared </s>
<s>  and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clays being
of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore
aggravation </s>
<s> 

anne herself was become hardened to such affronts </s>
<s>  but she felt the
imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell </s>
<s>   with a
great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often
wished less of her fathers character she was sensible that results
the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than
possible </s>
<s>   she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea
of the kind </s>
<s>   mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a
clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in
her absence </s>
<s>  but she was young and certainly altogether welllooking
and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners
infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might
have been </s>
<s>   anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that
she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her
sister </s>
<s>   she had little hope of success </s>
<s>  but elizabeth who in the
event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than
herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for
giving no warning </s>
<s> 

she spoke and seemed only to offend </s>
<s>   elizabeth could not conceive how
such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered
for each partys perfectly knowing their situation </s>
<s> 

mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is </s>
<s>  and as i am
rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can
assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly
nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more
strongly than most people </s>
<s>   and as to my father i really should not
have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our
sakes need be suspected now </s>
<s>   if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman
i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me </s>
<s>  not that
anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a
degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy </s>
<s>   but poor mrs clay
who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably
pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect
safety </s>
<s>   one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her
personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times </s>
<s>   that tooth
of hers and those freckles </s>
<s>   freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him </s>
<s>   i have known a face not materially disfigured by a
few but he abominates them </s>
<s>   you must have heard him notice mrs clays
freckles </s>
<s> 

there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an
agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to </s>
<s> 

i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly </s>
<s>  an agreeable
manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones </s>
<s> 
however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this
point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you
to be advising me </s>
<s> 

anne had done </s>
<s>  glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of
doing good </s>
<s>   elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be
made observant by it </s>
<s> 

the last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw sir walter
miss elliot and mrs clay to bath </s>
<s>  the party drove off in very good
spirits </s>
<s>  sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the
afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate
tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week </s>
<s> 

her friend was not in better spirits than herself </s>
<s>  lady russell felt
this breakup of the family exceedingly </s>
<s>   their respectability was as
dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by
habit </s>
<s>   it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still
worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into </s>
<s>  and to escape
the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out
of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined
to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne </s>
<s> 
accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at
uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russells journey </s>
<s> 

uppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back had
been completely in the old english style containing only two houses
superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers </s>
<s>  the
mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees
substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage
enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree trained
round its casements </s>
<s>  but upon the marriage of the young squire it had
received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage for
his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french
windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the
travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and
premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on </s>
<s> 

here anne had often been staying </s>
<s>  she knew the ways of uppercross as
well as those of kellynch </s>
<s>  the two families were so continually
meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each others
house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary
alone </s>
<s>  but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course </s>
<s>  though better endowed than the elder sister mary
had not annes understanding nor temper </s>
<s>  while well and happy and
properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits </s>
<s> 
but any indisposition sunk her completely </s>
<s>  she had no resources for
solitude </s>
<s>  and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot
selfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress that of
fancying herself neglected and illused </s>
<s>  in person she was inferior to
both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of
being a fine girl </s>
<s>  she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty
little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which had been
gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two
children </s>
<s>  and on annes appearing greeted her with

so you are come at last </s>
<s>   i began to think i should never see you </s>
<s>   i
am so ill i can hardly speak </s>
<s>   i have not seen a creature the whole
morning </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne </s>
<s>   you sent me such a
good account of yourself on thursday </s>
<s> 

yes i made the best of it </s>
<s>  i always do </s>
<s>   but i was very far from well
at the time </s>
<s>  and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have
been all this morning </s>
<s>   very unfit to be left alone i am sure </s>
<s> 
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not
able to ring the bell </s>
<s>   so lady russell would not get out </s>
<s>   i do not
think she has been in this house three times this summer </s>
<s> 

anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s> 
charles is out shooting </s>
<s>   i have not seen him since seven oclock </s>
<s>   he
would go though i told him how ill i was </s>
<s>   he said he should not stay
out long </s>
<s>  but he has never come back and now it is almost one </s>
<s>   i
assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning </s>
<s> 

you have had your little boys with you </s>
<s> 

yes as long as i could bear their noise </s>
<s>  but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good </s>
<s>   little charles does not mind a
word i say and walter is growing quite as bad </s>
<s> 

well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully </s>
<s>   you
know i always cure you when i come </s>
<s>   how are your neighbours at the
great house </s>
<s> 

i can give you no account of them </s>
<s>   i have not seen one of them
today except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the
window but without getting off his horse </s>
<s>  and though i told him how
ill i was not one of them have been near me </s>
<s>   it did not happen to
suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out
of their way </s>
<s> 

you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone </s>
<s>   it is
early </s>
<s> 

i never want them i assure you </s>
<s>   they talk and laugh a great deal too
much for me </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  anne i am so very unwell </s>
<s>   it was quite unkind of
you not to come on thursday </s>
<s> 

my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of
yourself </s>
<s>   you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were
perfectly well and in no hurry for me </s>
<s>  and that being the case you
must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the
last </s>
<s>  and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so
busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have
left kellynch sooner </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  what can you possibly have to do </s>
<s> 

a great many things i assure you </s>
<s>   more than i can recollect in a
moment </s>
<s>  but i can tell you some </s>
<s>   i have been making a duplicate of the
catalogue of my fathers books and pictures </s>
<s>   i have been several times
in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him
understand which of elizabeths plants are for lady russell </s>
<s>   i have
had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide
and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what
was intended as to the waggons </s>
<s>  and one thing i have had to do mary
of a more trying nature </s>
<s>  going to almost every house in the parish as
a sort of takeleave </s>
<s>   i was told that they wished it </s>
<s>   but all these
things took up a great deal of time </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  and after a moments pause but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday </s>
<s> 

did you go then </s>
<s>   i have made no enquiries because i concluded you
must have been obliged to give up the party </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  i went </s>
<s>   i was very well yesterday </s>
<s>  nothing at all the matter
with me till this morning </s>
<s>   it would have been strange if i had not
gone </s>
<s> 

i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant
party </s>
<s> 

nothing remarkable </s>
<s>   one always knows beforehand what the dinner will
be and who will be there </s>
<s>  and it is so very uncomfortable not having a
carriage of ones own </s>
<s>   mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so
crowded </s>
<s>   they are both so very large and take up so much room </s>
<s>  and mr
musgrove always sits forward </s>
<s>   so there was i crowded into the back
seat with henrietta and louisa </s>
<s>  and i think it very likely that my
illness today may be owing to it </s>
<s> 

a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on
annes side produced nearly a cure on marys </s>
<s>   she could soon sit
upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by
dinnertime </s>
<s>   then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end
of the room beautifying a nosegay </s>
<s>  then she ate her cold meat </s>
<s>  and
then she was well enough to propose a little walk </s>
<s> 

where shall we go </s>
<s>  said she when they were ready </s>
<s>   i suppose you
will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see
you </s>
<s> 

i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne </s>
<s>   i
should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so
well as mrs and the miss musgroves </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible </s>
<s>   they ought
to feel what is due to you as my sister </s>
<s>   however we may as well go
and sit with them a little  while and when we have that over we can
enjoy our walk </s>
<s> 

anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent </s>
<s> 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither
family could now do without it </s>
<s>   to the great house accordingly they
went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour
with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters
of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a
grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables placed in
every direction </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  could the originals of the portraits against the
wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an
overthrow of all order and neatness </s>
<s>   the portraits themselves seemed
to be staring in astonishment </s>
<s> 

the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration
perhaps of improvement </s>
<s>   the father and mother were in the old english
style and the young people in the new </s>
<s>   mr and mrs musgrove were a
very good sort of people </s>
<s>  friendly and hospitable not much educated
and not at all elegant </s>
<s>   their children had more modern minds and
manners </s>
<s>   there was a numerous family </s>
<s>  but the only two grown up
excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen
and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock
of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies
living to be fashionable happy and merry </s>
<s>   their dress had every
advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely
good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant </s>
<s>  they were of consequence
at home and favourites abroad </s>
<s>   anne always contemplated them as some
of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance </s>
<s>  but still saved as we
all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for
the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more
elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments </s>
<s>  and envied them
nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement
together that goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known
so little herself with either of her sisters </s>
<s> 

they were received with great cordiality </s>
<s>   nothing seemed amiss on the
side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well
knew the least to blame </s>
<s>   the half hour was chatted away pleasantly
enough </s>
<s>  and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have
their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at marys
particular invitation </s>
<s> 



chapter 


anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three
miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and
idea </s>
<s>   she had never been staying there before without being struck by
it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in
seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at
kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading
interest </s>
<s>  yet with all this experience she believed she must now
submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own
nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her </s>
<s>  for
certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which
had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in
the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove </s>
<s>  so miss
anne sir walter and your sister are gone </s>
<s>  and what part of bath do you
think they will settle in </s>
<s>  and this without much waiting for an
answer </s>
<s>  or in the young ladies addition of i hope we shall be in
bath in the winter </s>
<s>  but remember papa if we do go we must be in a
good situation </s>
<s>   none of your queen squares for us </s>
<s>  or in the anxious
supplement from mary ofupon my word i shall be pretty well off
when you are all gone away to be happy at bath </s>
<s> 

she could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future and think
with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one
such truly sympathising friend as lady russell </s>
<s> 

the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own
horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully
occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours
dress dancing and music </s>
<s>   she acknowledged it to be very fitting
that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of
discourse </s>
<s>  and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the
one she was now transplanted into </s>
<s>   with the prospect of spending at
least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to
clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of
uppercross as possible </s>
<s> 

she had no dread of these two months </s>
<s>   mary was not so repulsive and
unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers </s>
<s> 
neither was there anything among the other component parts of the
cottage inimical to comfort </s>
<s>   she was always on friendly terms with her
brotherinlaw </s>
<s>  and in the children who loved her nearly as well and
respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of
interest amusement and wholesome exertion </s>
<s> 

charles musgrove was civil and agreeable </s>
<s>  in sense and temper he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation
or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a
dangerous contemplation </s>
<s>  though at the same time anne could believe
with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved
him </s>
<s>  and that a woman of real understanding might have given more
consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and
elegance to his habits and pursuits </s>
<s>   as it was he did nothing with
much zeal but sport </s>
<s>  and his time was otherwise trifled away without
benefit from books or anything else </s>
<s>   he had very good spirits which
never seemed much affected by his wifes occasional lowness bore with
her unreasonableness sometimes to annes admiration and upon the
whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she
had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both
parties they might pass for a happy couple </s>
<s>   they were always
perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination
for a handsome present from his father </s>
<s>  but here as on most topics he
had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such
a present was not made he always contended for his fathers having
many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked </s>
<s> 

as to the management of their children his theory was much better than
his wifes and his practice not so bad </s>
<s>   i could manage them very
well if it were not for marys interference was what anne often
heard him say and had a good deal of faith in </s>
<s>  but when listening in
turn to marys reproach of charles spoils the children so that i
cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation
to say very true </s>
<s> 

one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her
being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too
much in the secret of the complaints of each house </s>
<s>   known to have some
influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least
receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable </s>
<s>   i wish you
could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was
charless language </s>
<s>  and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary </s>
<s>  i do
believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was
anything the matter with me </s>
<s>   i am sure anne if you would you might
persuade him that i really am very illa great deal worse than i ever
own </s>
<s> 

marys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great
house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she
humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much
trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day </s>
<s>   and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with anne to say oh </s>
<s>  miss anne i cannot help wishing
mrs charles had a little of your method with those children </s>
<s>   they are
quite different creatures with you </s>
<s>   but to be sure in general they
are so spoilt </s>
<s>   it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of
managing them </s>
<s>   they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen
poor little dears </s>
<s>  without partiality </s>
<s>  but mrs charles knows no more
how they should be treated </s>
<s>   bless me </s>
<s>  how troublesome they are
sometimes </s>
<s>   i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them
at our house so often as i otherwise should </s>
<s>   i believe mrs charles is
not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener </s>
<s>  but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment </s>
<s>  dont do this and dont do that </s>
<s>  or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them </s>
<s> 

she had this communication moreover from mary </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove thinks
all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in
question </s>
<s>  but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper
housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being in their business are
gadding about the village all day long </s>
<s>   i meet them wherever i go </s>
<s> 
and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing
something of them </s>
<s>   if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest
creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her </s>
<s>  for she tells
me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them </s>
<s>  and on mrs
musgroves side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of
my daughterinlaws concerns for i know it would not do </s>
<s>  but i shall
tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights
that i have no very good opinion of mrs charless nurserymaid </s>
<s>  i hear
strange stories of her </s>
<s>  she is always upon the gad </s>
<s>  and from my own
knowledge i can declare she is such a finedressing lady that she is
enough to ruin any servants she comes near </s>
<s>   mrs charles quite swears
by her i know </s>
<s>  but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the
watch </s>
<s>  because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of
mentioning it </s>
<s> 

again it was marys complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to
give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great
house with other families </s>
<s>  and she did not see any reason why she was
to be considered so much at home as to lose her place </s>
<s>   and one day
when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after
talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no
scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about
their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you
are about it </s>
<s>  but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would
be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if
she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma </s>
<s> 
nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be
more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it </s>
<s>   it is not that
mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken
notice of by many persons </s>
<s> 

how was anne to set all these matters to rights </s>
<s>   she could do little
more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to
the other </s>
<s>  give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between
such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant
for her sisters benefit </s>
<s> 

in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well </s>
<s>   her
own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed
three miles from kellynch </s>
<s>  marys ailments lessened by having a
constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family
since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment
in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage </s>
<s>   it
was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every
morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder </s>
<s>  but she believed
they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs
musgroves respectable forms in the usual places or without the
talking laughing and singing of their daughters </s>
<s> 

she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but
having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit
by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought
of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well
aware </s>
<s>   she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to
herself </s>
<s>  but this was no new sensation </s>
<s>   excepting one short period of
her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the
loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or
encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste </s>
<s>   in music she had
been always used to feel alone in the world </s>
<s>  and mr and mrs musgroves
fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total
indifference to any other persons gave her much more pleasure for
their sakes than mortification for her own </s>
<s> 

the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company </s>
<s> 
the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by
everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers more visitors
by invitation and by chance than any other family </s>
<s>   they were more
completely popular </s>
<s> 

the girls were wild for dancing </s>
<s>  and the evenings ended occasionally
in an unpremeditated little ball </s>
<s>   there was a family of cousins within
a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on
the musgroves for all their pleasures </s>
<s>   they would come at any time
and help play at anything or dance anywhere </s>
<s>  and anne very much
preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country
dances to them by the hour together </s>
<s>  a kindness which always
recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove
more than anything else and often drew this compliment </s>
<s> well done
miss anne </s>
<s>  very well done indeed </s>
<s>   lord bless me </s>
<s>   how those little
fingers of yours fly about </s>
<s> 

so passed the first three weeks </s>
<s>   michaelmas came </s>
<s>  and now annes heart
must be in kellynch again </s>
<s>   a beloved home made over to others </s>
<s>  all the
precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own
other eyes and other limbs </s>
<s>   she could not think of much else on the
th of september </s>
<s>  and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening
from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month
exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to
kellynch </s>
<s>   i am glad i did not think of it before </s>
<s>   how low it makes
me </s>
<s> 

the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be
visited </s>
<s>   mary deplored the necessity for herself </s>
<s>   nobody knew how
much she should suffer </s>
<s>   she should put it off as long as she could </s>
<s> 
but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on
an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of
imaginary agitation when she came back </s>
<s>   anne had very sincerely
rejoiced in there being no means of her going </s>
<s>   she wished however to
see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned </s>
<s> 
they came </s>
<s>   the master of the house was not at home but the two
sisters were together </s>
<s>  and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the
share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very
agreeable by his goodhumoured notice of her little boys she was well
able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to
catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression </s>
<s> 

mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness
and vigour of form which gave importance to her person </s>
<s>   she had
bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face </s>
<s>  though
her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence of her
having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have
lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty </s>
<s> 
her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust
of herself and no doubts of what to do </s>
<s>  without any approach to
coarseness however or any want of good humour </s>
<s>   anne gave her credit
indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all
that related to kellynch and it pleased her </s>
<s>  especially as she had
satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of
introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on mrs crofts side to give a bias of any sort </s>
<s>   she was
quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage
till for a moment electrified by mrs crofts suddenly saying

it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the
pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country </s>
<s> 

anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing </s>
<s>  but the age of emotion
she certainly had not </s>
<s> 

perhaps you may not have heard that he is married </s>
<s>  added mrs croft </s>
<s> 

she could now answer as she ought </s>
<s>  and was happy to feel when mrs
crofts next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke
that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother </s>
<s>  she
immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be
thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick </s>
<s>  and with shame
at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their
former neighbours present state with proper interest </s>
<s> 

the rest was all tranquillity </s>
<s>  till just as they were moving she
heard the admiral say to mary

we are expecting a brother of mrs crofts here soon </s>
<s>  i dare say you
know him by name </s>
<s> 

he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to
him like an old friend and declaring he should not go </s>
<s>  and being too
much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets
&c </s>
<s>  to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had
begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that
the same brother must still be in question </s>
<s>   she could not however
reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether
anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the
crofts had previously been calling </s>
<s> 

the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at
the cottage </s>
<s>  and it being now too late in the year for such visits to
be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the
youngest miss musgrove walked in </s>
<s>   that she was coming to apologize
and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the
first black idea </s>
<s>  and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa
made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more
room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage </s>
<s> 

and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it </s>
<s>   i am
come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this
evening especially mamma </s>
<s>  she is thinking so much of poor richard </s>
<s> 
and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse
her more than the pianoforte </s>
<s>   i will tell you why she is out of
spirits </s>
<s>   when the crofts called this morning they called here
afterwards did not they </s>
<s>  they happened to say that her brother
captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or
something and is coming to see them almost directly </s>
<s>  and most
unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone that
wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richards
captain at one time </s>
<s>  i do not know when or where but a great while
before he died poor fellow </s>
<s>   and upon looking over his letters and
things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be
the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard </s>
<s> 
so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon
such gloomy things </s>
<s> 

the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were
that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome
hopeless son </s>
<s>  and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his
twentieth year </s>
<s>  that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and
unmanageable on shore </s>
<s>  that he had been very little cared for at any
time by his family though quite as much as he deserved </s>
<s>  seldom heard
of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death
abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before </s>
<s> 

he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for
him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a
thickheaded unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done
anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name
living or dead </s>
<s> 

he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those
removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such
midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on
board captain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia </s>
<s>  and from the
laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only
two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him
during the whole of his absence </s>
<s>  that is to say the only two
disinterested letters </s>
<s>  all the rest had been mere applications for
money </s>
<s> 

in each letter he had spoken well of his captain </s>
<s>  but yet so little
were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and
incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made
scarcely any impression at the time </s>
<s>  and that mrs musgrove should have
been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of
wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary
bursts of mind which do sometimes occur </s>
<s> 

she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed </s>
<s>  and the
reperusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son
gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had
affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for
him than she had known on first hearing of his death </s>
<s>   mr musgrove was
in a lesser degree affected likewise </s>
<s>  and when they reached the
cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew
on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful
companions could give them </s>
<s> 

to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name
so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it
might that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain
wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their
coming back from cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say
whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to
annes nerves </s>
<s>   she found however that it was one to which she must
inure herself </s>
<s>   since he actually was expected in the country she must
teach herself to be insensible on such points </s>
<s>   and not only did it
appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their
warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high
respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been
six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not
perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two
perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing
themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of
his arrival </s>
<s> 

the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening </s>

chapter 


a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at
kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his
praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by
the end of another week </s>
<s>   it had been a great disappointment to mr
musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was
he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own
roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his
cellars </s>
<s>   but a week must pass </s>
<s>  only a week in annes reckoning and
then she supposed they must meet </s>
<s>  and soon she began to wish that she
could feel secure even for a week </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour </s>
<s>   she and mary
were actually setting forward for the great house where as she
afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were
stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in
consequence of a bad fall </s>
<s>   the childs situation put the visit
entirely aside </s>
<s>  but she could not hear of her escape with indifference
even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on
his account </s>
<s> 

his collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in
the back as roused the most alarming ideas </s>
<s>   it was an afternoon of
distress and anne had every thing to do at once </s>
<s>  the apothecary to
send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to
support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest
child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe </s>
<s> 
besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the
other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened
enquiring companions than of very useful assistants </s>
<s> 

her brothers return was the first comfort </s>
<s>  he could take best care of
his wife </s>
<s>  and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary </s>
<s> 
till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the
worse for being vague </s>
<s>  they suspected great injury but knew not where </s>
<s> 
but now the collarbone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt
and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the
father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be
able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind </s>
<s>  and then
it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so
far to digress from their nephews state as to give the information of
captain wentworths visit </s>
<s>  staying five minutes behind their father and
mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with
him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him
than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all
a favourite before </s>
<s>   how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to
stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and
how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mammas
farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the
morrowactually on the morrow </s>
<s>  and he had promised it in so pleasant a
manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he
ought </s>
<s>   and in short he had looked and said everything with such
exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both
turned by him </s>
<s>  and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and
apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles </s>
<s> 

the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls
came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make
enquiries </s>
<s>  and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about
his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would
be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry
to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the
little boy to give him the meeting </s>
<s>   oh no </s>
<s>  as to leaving the little
boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought </s>
<s>  and anne in the joy of the escape could not help
adding her warm protestations to theirs </s>
<s> 

charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination </s>
<s>  the
child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to
captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening </s>
<s>  he
would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour </s>
<s>  but
in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh </s>
<s>  no indeed
charles i cannot bear to have you go away </s>
<s>   only think if anything
should happen </s>
<s> 

the child had a good night and was going on well the next day </s>
<s>   it
must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the
spine </s>
<s>  but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles
musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer
confinement </s>
<s>   the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as
possible </s>
<s>  but what was there for a father to do </s>
<s>   this was quite a
female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no
use at home to shut himself up </s>
<s>   his father very much wished him to
meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against
it he ought to go </s>
<s>  and it ended in his making a bold public
declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress
directly and dine at the other house </s>
<s> 

nothing can be going on better than the child said he </s>
<s>  so i told my
father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right </s>
<s> 
your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all </s>
<s>   you
would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use </s>
<s> 
anne will send for me if anything is the matter </s>
<s> 

husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain </s>
<s> 
mary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was quite
determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him </s>
<s>   she
said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as
there was only anne to hear

so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick
child </s>
<s>  and not a creature coming near us all the evening </s>
<s>   i knew how
it would be </s>
<s>   this is always my luck </s>
<s>   if there is anything
disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles
is as bad as any of them </s>
<s>   very unfeeling </s>
<s>   i must say it is very
unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy </s>
<s>   talks of
his being going on so well </s>
<s>   how does he know that he is going on well
or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence </s>
<s>   i did not
think charles would have been so unfeeling </s>
<s>   so here he is to go away
and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be
allowed to stir </s>
<s>  and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else
to be about the child </s>
<s>   my being the mother is the very reason why my
feelings should not be tried </s>
<s>   i am not at all equal to it </s>
<s>   you saw
how hysterical i was yesterday </s>
<s> 

but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarmof the
shock </s>
<s>   you will not be hysterical again </s>
<s>   i dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us </s>
<s>   i perfectly understand mr robinsons
directions and have no fears </s>
<s>  and indeed mary i cannot wonder at
your husband </s>
<s>   nursing does not belong to a man </s>
<s>  it is not his
province </s>
<s>   a sick child is always the mothers property </s>
<s>   her own
feelings generally make it so </s>
<s> 

i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that
i am of any more use in the sickroom than charles for i cannot be
always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill </s>
<s>  and you saw
this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin
kicking about </s>
<s>   i have not nerves for the sort of thing </s>
<s> 

but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole
evening away from the poor boy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  you see his papa can and why should not i </s>
<s>   jemima is so
careful </s>
<s>  and she could send us word every hour how he was </s>
<s>   i really
think charles might as well have told his father we would all come </s>
<s>   i
am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is </s>
<s>   i was
dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today </s>
<s> 

well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself
suppose you were to go as well as your husband </s>
<s>   leave little charles
to my care </s>
<s>   mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain
with him </s>
<s> 

are you serious </s>
<s>  cried mary her eyes brightening </s>
<s>   dear me </s>
<s>   thats
a very good thought very good indeed </s>
<s>   to be sure i may just as well
go as not for i am of no use at homeam i </s>
<s>   and it only harasses me </s>
<s> 
you who have not a mothers feelings are a great deal the properest
person </s>
<s>   you can make little charles do anything </s>
<s>  he always minds you
at a word </s>
<s>   it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with
jemima </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  i shall certainly go </s>
<s>  i am sure i ought if i can quite as
much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with
captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone </s>
<s>   an
excellent thought of yours indeed anne </s>
<s>   i will go and tell charles
and get ready directly </s>
<s>   you can send for us you know at a moments
notice if anything is the matter </s>
<s>  but i dare say there will be nothing
to alarm you </s>
<s>   i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel
quite at ease about my dear child </s>
<s> 

the next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door
and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole
conversation which began with marys saying in a tone of great
exultation

i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than
you are </s>
<s>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should
not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like </s>
<s>   anne will
stay </s>
<s>  anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him </s>
<s>   it is
annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great
deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday </s>
<s> 

this is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be
very glad to have you go </s>
<s>  but it seems rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself to nurse our sick child </s>
<s> 

anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her
manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at
least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left
to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening
when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to
let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable </s>
<s>  and this
being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off
together in high spirits </s>
<s>   they were gone she hoped to be happy
however oddly constructed such happiness might seem </s>
<s>  as for herself
she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever
likely to be hers </s>
<s>   she knew herself to be of the first utility to the
child </s>
<s>  and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a
mile distant making himself agreeable to others </s>
<s> 

she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting </s>
<s>   perhaps
indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances </s>
<s>   he
must be either indifferent or unwilling </s>
<s>   had he wished ever to see her
again he need not have waited till this time </s>
<s>  he would have done what
she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long
ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone
had been wanting </s>
<s> 

her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance
and their visit in general </s>
<s>   there had been music singing talking
laughing all that was most agreeable </s>
<s>  charming manners in captain
wentworth no shyness or reserve </s>
<s>  they seemed all to know each other
perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with
charles </s>
<s>   he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though
that had been proposed at first </s>
<s>  but then he had been pressed to come
to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs
charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore
somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him
to breakfast at his fathers </s>
<s> 

anne understood it </s>
<s>   he wished to avoid seeing her </s>
<s>   he had inquired
after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight
acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged
actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they
were to meet </s>
<s> 

the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the
other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary
and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to
say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs
that his sisters were following with captain wentworth </s>
<s>  his sisters
meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth proposing
also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient </s>
<s>  and though
charles had answered for the childs being in no such state as could
make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without
his running on to give notice </s>
<s> 

mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive
him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was the
most consoling that it would soon be over </s>
<s>   and it was soon over </s>
<s>   in
two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared </s>
<s>  they were
in the drawingroom </s>
<s>   her eye half met captain wentworths a bow a
curtsey passed </s>
<s>  she heard his voice </s>
<s>  he talked to mary said all that
was right said something to the miss musgroves enough to mark an easy
footing </s>
<s>  the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few
minutes ended it </s>
<s>   charles shewed himself at the window all was ready
their visitor had bowed and was gone the miss musgroves were gone too
suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the
sportsmen </s>
<s>   the room was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast
as she could </s>
<s> 

it is over </s>
<s>  it is over </s>
<s>  she repeated to herself again and again in
nervous gratitude </s>
<s>   the worst is over </s>
<s> 

mary talked but she could not attend </s>
<s>   she had seen him </s>
<s>   they had
met </s>
<s>   they had been once more in the same room </s>
<s> 

soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling
less </s>
<s>   eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been
given up </s>
<s>   how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an
interval had banished into distance and indistinctness </s>
<s>   what might not
eight years do </s>
<s>   events of every description changes alienations
removalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past
how natural how certain too </s>
<s>   it included nearly a third part of her
own life </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>  with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing </s>
<s> 

now how were his sentiments to be read </s>
<s>   was this like wishing to
avoid her </s>
<s>   and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly
which asked the question </s>
<s> 

on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have
prevented she was soon spared all suspense </s>
<s>  for after the miss
musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had
this spontaneous information from mary </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so
attentive to me </s>
<s>   henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they
went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known
you again </s>
<s> 

mary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
wound </s>
<s> 

altered beyond his knowledge </s>
<s>   anne fully submitted in silent deep
mortification </s>
<s>   doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for
he was not altered or not for the worse </s>
<s>   she had already acknowledged
it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of
her as he would </s>
<s>   no </s>
<s>   the years which had destroyed her youth and
bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no
respect lessening his personal advantages </s>
<s>   she had seen the same

<s>

<s>   these were words
which could not but dwell with her </s>
<s>   yet she soon began to rejoice that
she had heard them </s>
<s>   they were of sobering tendency </s>
<s>  they allayed
agitation </s>
<s>  they composed and consequently must make her happier </s>
<s> 

frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but
without an idea that they would be carried round to her </s>
<s>   he had
thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had
spoken as he felt </s>
<s>   he had not forgiven anne elliot </s>
<s>   she had used him
ill deserted and disappointed him </s>
<s>  and worse she had shewn a
feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident
temper could not endure </s>
<s>   she had given him up to oblige others </s>
<s>   it
had been the effect of overpersuasion </s>
<s>   it had been weakness and
timidity </s>
<s> 

he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman
since whom he thought her equal </s>
<s>  but except from some natural
sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again </s>
<s>   her
power with him was gone for ever </s>
<s> 

it was now his object to marry </s>
<s>   he was rich and being turned on
shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly

<s>  actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the
speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow </s>
<s>   he had a heart

<s>  a heart in

<s>   this was his only secret exception when he said to his

<s> 

yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match </s>
<s>   anybody

<s> 

he said it she knew to be contradicted </s>
<s>   his bright proud eye spoke
the conviction that he was nice </s>
<s>  and anne elliot was not out of his

meet with </s>
<s>   a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first
and the last of the description </s>

chapter 


from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the
same circle </s>
<s>   they were soon dining in company together at mr
musgroves for the little boys state could no longer supply his aunt
with a pretence for absenting herself </s>
<s>  and this was but the beginning
of other dinings and other meetings </s>
<s> 

whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the
proof </s>
<s>  former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of
each </s>
<s>  they could not but be reverted to </s>
<s>  the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth </s>
<s>   his profession qualified him his
disposition lead him to talk </s>
<s>  and that was in the year six </s>
<s>  that
happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course
of the first evening they spent together </s>
<s>  and though his voice did not
falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering
towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her
knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any
more than herself </s>
<s>   there must be the same immediate association of
thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain </s>
<s> 

they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the
commonest civility required </s>
<s>   once so much to each other </s>
<s>   now nothing </s>
<s> 
there had been a time when of all the large party now filling the
drawingroom at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to
cease to speak to one another </s>
<s>   with the exception perhaps of admiral
and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could
allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could
have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so
in unison no countenances so beloved </s>
<s>   now they were as strangers </s>
<s> 
nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted </s>
<s>   it
was a perpetual estrangement </s>
<s> 

when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind </s>
<s> 
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
party </s>
<s>  and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss
musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the
manner of living on board daily regulations food hours &c </s>
<s>  and
their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation
and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant
ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been
ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be
living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if
there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use </s>
<s> 

from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs
musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying

ah </s>
<s>  miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare
say he would have been just such another by this time </s>
<s> 

anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove
relieved her heart a little more </s>
<s>  and for a few minutes therefore
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others </s>
<s> 

when she could let her attention take its natural course again she
found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy
list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down
together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the
ships that captain wentworth had commanded </s>
<s> 

your first was the asp i remember </s>

the girls looked all amazement </s>

sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed </s>

but they have a great many to provide for </s>
<s>  and among the thousands that

but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been
when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you </s>
<s> 

i knew pretty well what she was before that day </s>
<s>  said he smiling </s>
<s> 
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the
fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about
among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which
at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  she was a dear
old asp to me </s>
<s>   she did all that i wanted </s>
<s>   i knew she would </s>
<s>   i knew
that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be
the making of me </s>
<s>  and i never had two days of foul weather all the time
i was at sea in her </s>
<s>  and after taking privateers enough to be very
entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn
to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted </s>
<s>   i brought her into
plymouth </s>
<s>  and here another instance of luck </s>
<s>   we had not been six hours
in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights
and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time </s>
<s>  our touch
with the great nation not having much improved our condition </s>
<s> 
fourandtwenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant
captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the
newspapers </s>
<s>  and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought
about me </s>
<s>  annes shudderings were to herself alone </s>
<s>  but the miss
musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations
of pity and horror </s>
<s> 

and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if
thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met
with our poor boy </s>
<s>  charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask
captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother </s>
<s>   i
always forgot </s>
<s> 

it was at gibraltar mother i know </s>
<s>   dick had been left ill at
gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain
wentworth </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of
mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to
hear him talked of by such a good friend </s>
<s> 

charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case
only nodded in reply and walked away </s>
<s> 

the girls were now hunting for the laconia </s>
<s>  and captain wentworth could
not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his
own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little
statement of her name and rate and present noncommissioned class
observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man
ever had </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  those were pleasant days when i had the laconia </s>
<s>   how fast i made
money in her </s>
<s>   a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together
off the western islands </s>
<s>   poor harville sister </s>
<s>   you know how much he
wanted money </s>
<s>   worse than myself </s>
<s>   he had a wife </s>
<s>   excellent fellow </s>
<s>   i
shall never forget his happiness </s>
<s>   he felt it all so much for her
sake </s>
<s>   i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the
same luck in the mediterranean </s>
<s> 

and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us
when you were put captain into that ship </s>
<s>   we shall never forget what
you did </s>
<s> 

her feelings made her speak low </s>
<s>  and captain wentworth hearing only in
part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts
looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more </s>
<s> 

my brother whispered one of the girls </s>
<s>  mamma is thinking of poor
richard </s>
<s> 

poor dear fellow </s>
<s>  continued mrs musgrove </s>
<s>  he was grown so steady
and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s> 
it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you </s>
<s>   i assure
you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you </s>
<s> 

there was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this
speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome
mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves
kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get
rid of him </s>
<s>  but it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to
be detected by any who understood him less than herself </s>
<s>  in another
moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly
afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were
sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with
her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and
natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was
real and unabsurd in the parents feelings </s>
<s> 

they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily
made room for him </s>
<s>  they were divided only by mrs musgrove </s>
<s>   it was no
insignificant barrier indeed </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove was of a comfortable
substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good
cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment </s>
<s>  and while the
agitations of annes slender form and pensive face may be considered
as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some
credit for the selfcommand with which he attended to her large fat
sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for </s>
<s> 

personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary
proportions </s>
<s>   a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep
affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world </s>
<s>   but fair
or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will
patronize in vainwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will
seize </s>
<s> 

the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came
up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might
be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with

if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you
would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her
daughters </s>
<s> 

should i </s>
<s>   i am glad i was not a week later then </s>
<s> 

the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry </s>
<s>   he defended himself </s>
<s> 
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on
board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few
hours might comprehend </s>
<s> 

but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry
towards them </s>
<s>   it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all
ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make the accommodations on
board such as women ought to have </s>
<s>   there can be no want of gallantry
admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high
and this is what i do </s>
<s>   i hate to hear of women on board or to see
them on board </s>
<s>  and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family
of ladies anywhere if i can help it </s>
<s> 

this brought his sister upon him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  frederick </s>
<s>   but i cannot believe it of you </s>
<s> all idle
refinement </s>
<s> women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house
in england </s>
<s>   i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and
i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar </s>
<s>   i
declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at
kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in
most of the ships i have lived in </s>
<s>  and they have been five altogether </s>
<s> 

nothing to the purpose replied her brother </s>
<s>   you were living with
your husband and were the only woman on board </s>
<s> 

but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and
three children round from portsmouth to plymouth </s>
<s>   where was this
superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then </s>
<s> 

all merged in my friendship sophia </s>
<s>   i would assist any brother
officers wife that i could and i would bring anything of harvilles
from the worlds end if he wanted it </s>
<s>   but do not imagine that i did
not feel it an evil in itself </s>
<s> 

depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable </s>
<s> 

i might not like them the better for that perhaps </s>
<s>   such a number of
women and children have no right to be comfortable on board </s>
<s> 

my dear frederick you are talking quite idly </s>
<s>   pray what would
become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one
port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings </s>
<s> 

my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all
her family to plymouth </s>
<s> 

but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if
women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures </s>
<s>   we none of
us expect to be in smooth water all our days </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife he will sing
a different tune </s>
<s>   when he is married if we have the good luck to live
to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many

he got up and moved away </s>

indies </s>
<s>   we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies </s>

mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent </s>

herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her
life </s>
<s> 

and i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can
exceed the accommodations of a manofwar </s>

higher rates </s>

confined </s>

them </s>

spent on board a ship </s>
<s>   while we were together you know there was
nothing to be feared </s>
<s>   thank god </s>
<s>   i have always been blessed with
excellent health and no climate disagrees with me </s>
<s>   a little
disordered always the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but
never knew what sickness was afterwards </s>
<s>   the only time i ever really
suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself
unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by
myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north
seas </s>
<s>   i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i

<s> 

aye to be sure </s>
<s>   yes indeed oh yes </s>
<s>   i am quite of your opinion
mrs croft was mrs musgroves hearty answer </s>
<s>   there is nothing so bad

<s>   i know what it is for

over and he is safe back again </s>
<s> 

the evening ended with dancing </s>
<s>   on its being proposed anne offered
her services as usual </s>
<s>  and though her eyes would sometimes fill with
tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be
employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved </s>
<s> 

it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than
captain wentworth </s>
<s>   she felt that he had every thing to elevate him
which general attention and deference and especially the attention of
all the young women could do </s>
<s>   the miss hayters the females of the
family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the
honour of being in love with him </s>

made it credible that they were not decided rivals </s>

little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could
wonder </s>
<s> 

these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers
were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together
equally without error and without consciousness </s>

him </s>

aware of it till she heard the answer </s>

play </s>

down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss

room </s>
<s>  he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness

i beg your pardon madam this is your seat </s>

chapter 


captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as
he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admirals fraternal
kindness as of his wifes </s>
<s>   he had intended on first arriving to
proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in
that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this
off </s>
<s>   there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of
everything most bewitching in his reception there </s>
<s>  the old were so
hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to
remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of
edwards wife upon credit a little longer </s>
<s> 

it was soon uppercross with him almost every day </s>
<s>   the musgroves could
hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the
morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs
croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in
their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig
lately added to their establishment </s>
<s> 

hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the
musgroves and their dependencies </s>
<s>   it was unvarying warm admiration
everywhere </s>
<s>  but this intimate footing was not more than established
when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal
disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way </s>
<s> 

charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable
pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a
considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths
introduction </s>
<s>   he was in orders </s>
<s>  and having a curacy in the
neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his fathers
house only two miles from uppercross </s>
<s>   a short absence from home had
left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners
and of seeing captain wentworth </s>
<s> 

mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters </s>
<s>   they had each had money but
their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
consequence </s>
<s>   mr hayter had some property of his own but it was
insignificant compared with mr musgroves </s>
<s>  and while the musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country the young hayters would
from their parents inferior retired and unpolished way of living
and their own defective education have been hardly in any class at
all but for their connexion with uppercross this eldest son of course
excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was
very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest </s>
<s> 

the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no
pride on one side and no envy on the other and only such a
consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them
pleased to improve their cousins </s>
<s>   charless attentions to henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation </s>
<s> 
it would not be a great match for her </s>
<s>  but if henrietta liked him
and henrietta did seem to like him </s>
<s> 

henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came </s>
<s>  but
from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten </s>
<s> 

which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet
quite doubtful as far as annes observation reached </s>
<s>   henrietta was
perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits </s>
<s>  and she knew not
now whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most
likely to attract him </s>
<s> 

mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from an entire
confidence in the discretion of both their daughters and of all the
young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its
chance </s>
<s>   there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark
about them in the mansionhouse </s>
<s>  but it was different at the cottage </s>
<s> 
the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder </s>
<s>  and
captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss
musgroves company and charles hayter had but just reappeared when
anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to
which was the one liked best </s>
<s>   charles gave it for louisa mary for
henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be
extremely delightful </s>
<s> 

charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life </s>
<s>  and from what he
had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that he had
not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war </s>
<s>   here was a
fortune at once </s>
<s>  besides which there would be the chance of what might
be done in any future war </s>
<s>  and he was sure captain wentworth was as
likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  it
would be a capital match for either of his sisters </s>
<s> 

upon my word it would replied mary </s>
<s>   dear me </s>
<s>   if he should rise to
any very great honours </s>
<s>   if he should ever be made a baronet </s>
<s>   lady
wentworth sounds very well </s>
<s>   that would be a noble thing indeed for
henrietta </s>
<s>   she would take place of me then and henrietta would not
dislike that </s>
<s>   sir frederick and lady wentworth </s>
<s>   it would be but a new
creation however and i never think much of your new creations </s>
<s> 

it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very
account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished to see put an
end to </s>
<s>   she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters and thought
it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between
the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children </s>
<s> 

you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for
henrietta </s>
<s>  and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made
she has no right to throw herself away </s>
<s>   i do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to
those who have not been used to them </s>
<s>   and pray who is charles
hayter </s>
<s>   nothing but a country curate </s>
<s>   a most improper match for miss
musgrove of uppercross </s>
<s> 

her husband however would not agree with her here </s>
<s>  for besides having
a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son and he saw
things as an eldest son himself </s>
<s> 

now you are talking nonsense mary was therefore his answer </s>
<s>   it
would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair
chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in
the course of a year or two </s>
<s>  and you will please to remember that he
is the eldest son </s>
<s>  whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty
property </s>
<s>   the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best
land in the country </s>
<s>   i grant you that any of them but charles would
be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be </s>
<s>  he
is the only one that could be possible </s>
<s>  but he is a very goodnatured
good sort of a fellow </s>
<s>  and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he
will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different
sort of way </s>
<s>  and with that property he will never be a contemptible
mangood freehold property </s>
<s>   no no </s>
<s>  henrietta might do worse than
marry charles hayter </s>
<s>  and if she has him and louisa can get captain
wentworth i shall be very well satisfied </s>
<s> 

charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he
was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry
charles hayter </s>
<s>  a very bad thing for her and still worse for me </s>
<s>  and
therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon
put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he
has </s>
<s>   she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday </s>
<s>   i wish
you had been there to see her behaviour </s>
<s>   and as to captain wentworths
liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so </s>
<s>  for he
certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best </s>
<s>   but charles is so
positive </s>
<s>   i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might
have decided between us </s>
<s>  and i am sure you would have thought as i did
unless you had been determined to give it against me </s>
<s> 

a dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by anne </s>
<s>  but she had staid at home under the
mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition
in little charles </s>
<s>   she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth </s>
<s> 
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the
advantages of a quiet evening </s>
<s> 

as to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence that
he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the
happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he
should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta </s>
<s>   either of
them would in all probability make him an affectionate goodhumoured
wife </s>
<s>   with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy which must be
pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning young woman and a
heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned </s>
<s>  but if
henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the
alteration could not be understood too soon </s>
<s> 

charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his
cousins behaviour </s>
<s>   she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly
estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and
leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross </s>
<s>   but there
was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain
wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause </s>
<s>   he had been absent
only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even
to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his
present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead </s>
<s>   it had then
seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who
for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties
of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should
be quite fixed on engaging a curate </s>
<s>  should make his curacy quite as
good as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of
it </s>
<s>   the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of
going six miles another way </s>
<s>  of his having in every respect a better
curacy </s>
<s>  of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr
shirleys being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get
through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to
louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta </s>
<s>   when he came
back alas </s>
<s>   the zeal of the business was gone by </s>
<s>   louisa could not
listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held
with dr shirley </s>
<s>  she was at a window looking out for captain
wentworth </s>
<s>  and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to
give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude
of the negotiation </s>
<s> 

well i am very glad indeed </s>
<s>   but i always thought you would have it </s>
<s> 
i always thought you sure </s>
<s>   it did not appear to me thatin short you
know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise </s>
<s> 
is he coming louisa </s>
<s> 

one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne
had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawingroom at
the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles
who was lying on the sofa </s>
<s> 

the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived
his manners of their usual composure </s>
<s>   he started and could only say
i thought the miss musgroves had been here </s>
<s>  mrs musgrove told me i
should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect
himself and feel how he ought to behave </s>
<s> 

they are up stairs with my sister </s>
<s>   they will be down in a few
moments i dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that
was natural </s>
<s>  and if the child had not called her to come and do
something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment
and released captain wentworth as well as herself </s>
<s> 

he continued at the window </s>
<s>  and after calmly and politely saying i
hope the little boy is better was silent </s>
<s> 

she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy
her patient </s>
<s>  and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very
great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little
vestibule </s>
<s>   she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the
house </s>
<s>  but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters
easycharles hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight
of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of
anne </s>
<s> 

she only attempted to say how do you do </s>
<s>   will you not sit down </s>
<s>   the
others will be here presently </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not
illdisposed for conversation </s>
<s>  but charles hayter soon put an end to
his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the
newspaper </s>
<s>  and captain wentworth returned to his window </s>
<s> 

another minute brought another addition </s>
<s>   the younger boy a remarkable
stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for
him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and
went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his
claim to anything good that might be giving away </s>
<s> 

there being nothing to eat he could only have some play </s>
<s>  and as his
aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten
himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was
about charles she could not shake him off </s>
<s>   she spoke to him ordered
entreated and insisted in vain </s>
<s>   once she did contrive to push him
away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back
again directly </s>
<s> 

walter said she get down this moment </s>
<s>   you are extremely
troublesome </s>
<s>   i am very angry with you </s>
<s> 

walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid </s>
<s>   do
not you hear your aunt speak </s>
<s>   come to me walter come to cousin
charles </s>
<s> 

but not a bit did walter stir </s>
<s>

released from him </s>
<s>  some one was taking him from her though he had bent
down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened
from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew
that captain wentworth had done it </s>

her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless </s>
<s>   she
could not even thank him </s>
<s>   she could only hang over little charles
with most disordered feelings </s>
<s>   his kindness in stepping forward to her
relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little
particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her
by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to
avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her
conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of
varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from

over her little patient to their cares and leave the room </s>

not stay </s>

jealousies of the fourthey were now altogether </s>

inclined towards captain wentworth </s>
<s>   she had a strong impression of his
having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths
interference you ought to have minded me walter </s>

teaze your aunt </s>

wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself </s>

charles hayters feelings nor anybodys feelings could interest her

chapter 


other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur </s>
<s> 
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife </s>
<s>  for
while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite she could not
but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and
experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either </s>
<s>   they
were more in love with him </s>
<s>  yet there it was not love </s>
<s>   it was a little
fever of admiration </s>
<s>  but it might probably must end in love with
some </s>
<s>   charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted and yet henrietta
had sometimes the air of being divided between them </s>
<s>   anne longed for
the power of representing to them all what they were about and of
pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to </s>
<s>   she
did not attribute guile to any </s>
<s>   it was the highest satisfaction to her
to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was
occasioning </s>
<s>   there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner </s>
<s> 
he had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of
charles hayter </s>
<s>   he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for
accepting must be the word of two young women at once </s>
<s> 

after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the
field </s>
<s>   three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross </s>
<s>  a
most decided change </s>
<s>   he had even refused one regular invitation to
dinner </s>
<s>  and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some
large books before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be
right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death </s>
<s> 
it was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of
seeing him tomorrow </s>
<s>   anne could only feel that charles hayter was
wise </s>
<s> 

one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth
being gone ashooting together as the sisters in the cottage were
sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters
from the mansionhouse </s>
<s> 

it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through
the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that
they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could
not like to go with them </s>
<s>  and when mary immediately replied with some
jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like
to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk </s>
<s>  anne felt
persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what
they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the
family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be
communicated and everything being to be done together however
undesired and inconvenient </s>
<s>   she tried to dissuade mary from going but
in vain </s>
<s>  and that being the case thought it best to accept the miss
musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as
she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the
interference in any plan of their own </s>
<s> 

i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long
walk said mary as she went up stairs </s>
<s>   everybody is always
supposing that i am not a good walker </s>
<s>  and yet they would not have been
pleased if we had refused to join them </s>
<s>   when people come in this
manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no </s>
<s> 

just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned </s>
<s>   they had taken
out a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early </s>
<s> 
their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready
for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure </s>
<s>   could anne have
foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home </s>
<s>  but from some
feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too
late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the
direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently considered the
walk as under their guidance </s>
<s> 

annes object was not to be in the way of anybody </s>
<s>  and where the
narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary to keep
with her brother and sister </s>
<s>   her pleasure in the walk must arise from
the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year
upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to
herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of
autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet
worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of
feeling </s>
<s>   she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like
musings and quotations </s>
<s>  but it was not possible that when within reach
of captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves
she should not try to hear it </s>
<s>  yet she caught little very remarkable </s>
<s> 
it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate
footing might fall into </s>
<s>   he was more engaged with louisa than with
henrietta </s>
<s>   louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her
sister </s>
<s>   this distinction appeared to increase and there was one
speech of louisas which struck her </s>
<s>   after one of the many praises of
the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth
added </s>
<s> 

what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister </s>
<s>   they meant to
take a long drive this morning </s>
<s>  perhaps we may hail them from some of
these hills </s>
<s>   they talked of coming into this side of the country </s>
<s>   i
wonder whereabouts they will upset today </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  it does happen very
often i assure you </s>
<s>  but my sister makes nothing of it </s>
<s>  she would as
lieve be tossed out as not </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were
really so i should do just the same in her place </s>
<s>   if i loved a man
as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should
ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven
safely by anybody else </s>
<s> 

it was spoken with enthusiasm </s>
<s> 

had you </s>
<s>  cried he catching the same tone </s>
<s>  i honour you </s>
<s>  and there
was silence between them for a little while </s>
<s> 

anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again </s>
<s>   the sweet
scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining
happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone
together blessed her memory </s>
<s>   she roused herself to say as they
struck by order into another path is not this one of the ways to
winthrop </s>
<s>  but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her </s>
<s> 

winthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes to be
met with strolling about near homewas their destination </s>
<s>  and after
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the
ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting
the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning to have spring again
they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted
uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter
at the foot of the hill on the other side </s>
<s> 

winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them </s>
<s> 
an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farmyard </s>
<s> 

mary exclaimed bless me </s>
<s>  here is winthrop </s>
<s>   i declare i had no idea </s>
<s> 
well now i think we had better turn back </s>
<s>  i am excessively tired </s>
<s> 

henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking
along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary
wished </s>
<s>  but no </s>
<s>  said charles musgrove and no no </s>
<s>  cried louisa
more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be arguing the
matter warmly </s>
<s> 

charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution
of calling on his aunt now that he was so near </s>
<s>  and very evidently
though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too </s>
<s>   but this
was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength </s>
<s>  and when
he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at
winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh </s>
<s>  no
indeed </s>
<s>  walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any
sitting down could do her good </s>
<s>  and in short her look and manner
declared that go she would not </s>
<s> 

after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations
it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and
henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and
cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
hill </s>
<s>   louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan </s>
<s>  and as she
went a little way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta
mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying
to captain wentworth

it is very unpleasant having such connexions </s>
<s>   but i assure you i
have never been in the house above twice in my life </s>
<s> 

she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile
followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne
perfectly knew the meaning of </s>
<s> 

the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot </s>
<s>  louisa
returned </s>
<s>  and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step
of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood
about her </s>
<s>  but when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for a
gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow and they were gone by
degrees quite out of sight and sound mary was happy no longer </s>
<s>  she
quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got a much better
somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a
better also </s>
<s>   she turned through the same gate but could not see them </s>
<s> 
anne found a nice seat for her on a dry sunny bank under the
hedgerow in which she had no doubt of their still being in some spot
or other </s>
<s>   mary sat down for a moment but it would not do </s>
<s>  she was
sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on
till she overtook her </s>
<s> 

anne really tired herself was glad to sit down </s>
<s>  and she very soon
heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if
making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the
centre </s>
<s>   they were speaking as they drew near </s>
<s>   louisas voice was the
first distinguished </s>
<s>   she seemed to be in the middle of some eager
speech </s>
<s>   what anne first heard was

and so i made her go </s>
<s>   i could not bear that she should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense </s>
<s>   what </s>
<s>  would i be turned back from
doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right
by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may
say </s>
<s>   no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded </s>
<s>   when i have
made up my mind i have made it </s>
<s>  and henrietta seemed entirely to have
made up hers to call at winthrop today </s>
<s>  and yet she was as near
giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance </s>
<s> 

she would have turned back then but for you </s>
<s> 

she would indeed </s>
<s>   i am almost ashamed to say it </s>
<s> 

happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand </s>
<s>   after the hints
you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last
time i was in company with him  i need not affect to have no
comprehension of what is going on </s>
<s>   i see that more than a mere dutiful
morning visit to your aunt was in question </s>
<s>  and woe betide him and her
too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in
circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not
resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this </s>
<s> 
your sister is an amiable creature </s>
<s>  but yours is the character of
decision and firmness i see </s>
<s>   if you value her conduct or happiness
infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can </s>
<s>   but this no
doubt you have been always doing </s>
<s>   it is the worst evil of too
yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be
depended on </s>
<s>   you are never sure of a good impression being durable </s>
<s> 
everybody may sway it </s>
<s>   let those who would be happy be firm </s>
<s>   here is
a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough to exemplify </s>
<s> 
a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has
outlived all the storms of autumn </s>
<s>   not a puncture not a weak spot
anywhere </s>
<s>   this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so
many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still
in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed
capable of </s>
<s>   then returning to his former earnest tonemy first
wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm </s>
<s>   if
louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life
she will cherish all her present powers of mind </s>
<s> 

he had done and was unanswered </s>
<s>   it would have surprised anne if
louisa could have readily answered such a speech </s>
<s>   words of such
interest spoken with such serious warmth </s>
<s>   she could imagine what
louisa was feeling </s>
<s>   for herself she feared to move lest she should
be seen </s>
<s>   while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected
her and they were moving on </s>
<s>   before they were beyond her hearing
however louisa spoke again </s>
<s> 

mary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she </s>
<s>  but she does
sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pridethe elliot
pride </s>
<s>   she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride </s>
<s>   we do so
wish that charles had married anne instead </s>
<s>   i suppose you know he
wanted to marry anne </s>
<s> 

after a moments pause captain wentworth said

do you mean that she refused him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  certainly </s>
<s> 

when did that happen </s>
<s> 

i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time </s>
<s> 
but i believe about a year before he married mary </s>
<s>   i wish she had
accepted him </s>
<s>   we should all have liked her a great deal better </s>
<s>  and
papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russells
doing that she did not </s>
<s>   they think charles might not be learned and
bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she
persuaded anne to refuse him </s>
<s> 

the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more </s>
<s>   her own
emotions still kept her fixed </s>
<s>   she had much to recover from before
she could move </s>
<s>   the listeners proverbial fate was not absolutely
hers </s>
<s>  she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal
of very painful import </s>
<s>   she saw how her own character was considered
by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme
agitation </s>
<s> 

as soon as she could she went after mary and having found and walked
back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort
in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once
more in motion together </s>
<s>   her spirits wanted the solitude and silence
which only numbers could give </s>
<s> 

charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured
charles hayter with them </s>
<s>   the minutiae of the business anne could not
attempt to understand </s>
<s>  even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to
perfect confidence here </s>
<s>  but that there had been a withdrawing on the
gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they were now
very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt </s>
<s>   henrietta
looked a little ashamed but very well pleased </s>
<s> charles hayter
exceedingly happy </s>
<s>   and they were devoted to each other almost from the
first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross </s>
<s> 

everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth </s>
<s>  nothing could
be plainer </s>
<s>  and where many divisions were necessary or even where they
were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two </s>
<s>   in
a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they
were thus divided forming three distinct parties </s>
<s>  and to that party of
the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne
necessarily belonged </s>
<s>   she joined charles and mary and was tired
enough to be very glad of charless other arm </s>
<s>  but charles though in
very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife </s>
<s>   mary had
shewn herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the consequence
which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut
off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch </s>
<s>  and when
mary began to complain of it and lament her being illused according
to custom in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded
on the other he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which
he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at
all </s>
<s> 

this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of
it was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit
the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been some time
heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral crofts gig </s>
<s>   he
and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home </s>
<s> 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they
kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired </s>
<s>  it
would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross </s>
<s> 
the invitation was general and generally declined </s>
<s>   the miss musgroves
were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked
before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could
not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise </s>
<s> 

the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an
opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again
when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his sister </s>
<s>   the something might be guessed by its effects </s>
<s> 

miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft </s>
<s>   do let us
have the pleasure of taking you home </s>
<s>   here is excellent room for
three i assure you </s>
<s>   if we were all like you i believe we might sit
four </s>
<s>   you must indeed you must </s>
<s> 

anne was still in the lane </s>
<s>  and though instinctively beginning to
decline she was not allowed to proceed </s>
<s>   the admirals kind urgency
came in support of his wifes </s>
<s>  they would not be refused </s>
<s>  they
compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a
corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her
and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  he had done it </s>
<s>   she was in the carriage and felt that he had
placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she
owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution to give
her rest </s>
<s>   she was very much affected by the view of his disposition
towards her which all these things made apparent </s>
<s>   this little
circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before </s>
<s>   she
understood him </s>
<s>   he could not forgive her but he could not be
unfeeling </s>
<s>   though condemning her for the past and considering it with
high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and
though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer
without the desire of giving her relief </s>
<s>   it was a remainder of former
sentiment </s>
<s>  it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged friendship </s>
<s> 
it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart which she could not
contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain that
she knew not which prevailed </s>
<s> 

her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at
first unconsciously given </s>
<s>   they had travelled half their way along the
rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said </s>
<s>   she then
found them talking of frederick </s>
<s> 

he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy
said the admiral </s>
<s>  but there is no saying which </s>
<s>   he has been running
after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind </s>
<s> 
ay this comes of the peace </s>
<s>   if it were war now he would have settled
it long ago </s>
<s>   we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long
courtships in time of war </s>
<s>   how many days was it my dear between the
first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our
lodgings at north yarmouth </s>
<s> 

we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft
pleasantly </s>
<s>  for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an
understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy
together </s>
<s>   i had known you by character however long before </s>
<s> 

well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we
to wait for besides </s>
<s>   i do not like having such things so long in hand </s>
<s> 
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home
one of these young ladies to kellynch </s>
<s>   then there would always be
company for them </s>
<s>   and very nice young ladies they both are </s>
<s>  i hardly
know one from the other </s>
<s> 

very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft in a
tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that her keener powers
might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother </s>
<s>  and
a very respectable family </s>
<s>   one could not be connected with better
people </s>
<s>   my dear admiral that post </s>
<s>   we shall certainly take that
post </s>
<s> 

but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger </s>
<s>  and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her
hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart </s>
<s>  and
anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined
no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found
herself safely deposited by them at the cottage </s>

chapter 


the time now approached for lady russells return </s>
<s>   the day was even
fixed </s>
<s>  and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was
resettled was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and
beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it </s>
<s> 

it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within
half a mile of him </s>
<s>  they would have to frequent the same church and
there must be intercourse between the two families </s>
<s>   this was against
her </s>
<s>  but on the other hand he spent so much of his time at uppercross
that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him
behind than as going towards him </s>
<s>  and upon the whole she believed
she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as
certainly as in her change of domestic society in leaving poor mary
for lady russell </s>
<s> 

she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain
wentworth at the hall </s>
<s>   those rooms had witnessed former meetings which
would be brought too painfully before her </s>
<s>  but she was yet more anxious
for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting
anywhere </s>
<s>   they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance
now could do any good </s>
<s>  and were lady russell to see them together she
might think that he had too much selfpossession and she too little </s>
<s> 

these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal
from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long
enough </s>
<s>   her usefulness to little charles would always give some
sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there but he was
gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for </s>
<s> 

the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way which
she had not at all imagined </s>
<s>   captain wentworth after being unseen and
unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away </s>
<s> 

a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at
last had brought intelligence of captain harvilles being settled with
his family at lyme for the winter </s>
<s>  of their being therefore quite
unknowingly within twenty miles of each other </s>
<s>   captain harville had
never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two
years before and captain wentworths anxiety to see him had determined
him to go immediately to lyme </s>
<s>   he had been there for fourandtwenty
hours </s>
<s>   his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a
lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine
country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party that an
earnest desire to see lyme themselves and a project for going thither
was the consequence </s>
<s> 

the young people were all wild to see lyme </s>
<s>   captain wentworth talked
of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from
uppercross </s>
<s>  though november the weather was by no means bad </s>
<s>  and in
short louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed the
resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked being
now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down
all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer </s>
<s> 
and to lyme they were to gocharles mary anne henrietta louisa
and captain wentworth </s>
<s> 

the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at
night </s>
<s>  but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not
consent </s>
<s>  and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the
middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place
after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for
going and returning </s>
<s>   they were consequently to stay the night there
and not to be expected back till the next days dinner </s>
<s>   this was felt
to be a considerable amendment </s>
<s>  and though they all met at the great
house at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually
it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgroves coach
containing the four ladies and charless curricle in which he drove
captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme and
entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself that it was
very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them
before the light and warmth of the day were gone </s>
<s> 

after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the
inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea </s>
<s>   they were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which lyme as a public place might offer </s>
<s>   the rooms were
shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but of the
residents left </s>
<s>  and as there is nothing to admire in the buildings
themselves the remarkable situation of the town the principal street
almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb skirting round
the pleasant little bay which in the season is animated with bathing
machines and company </s>
<s>  the cobb itself its old wonders and new
improvements with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to
the east of the town are what the strangers eye will seek </s>
<s>  and a very
strange stranger it must be who does not see charms in the immediate
environs of lyme to make him wish to know it better </s>
<s>   the scenes in

sweeps of country and still more its sweet retired bay backed by

up lyme </s>
<s>  and above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic
rocks where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant
growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the

state where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the farfamed isle of

the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and
melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves
on the seashore </s>
<s>  and lingering only as all must linger and gaze on a
first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all
proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself and on
captain wentworths account </s>
<s>   for in a small house near the foot of an
old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled </s>
<s>   captain
wentworth turned in to call on his friend </s>
<s>  the others walked on and he
was to join them on the cobb </s>
<s> 

they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring </s>
<s>  and not even
louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long
when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well
known already by description to be captain and mrs harville and a
captain benwick who was staying with them </s>
<s> 

captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia </s>
<s> 
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him on his return
from lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and
an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped
him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little
history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting
in the eyes of all the ladies </s>
<s>   he had been engaged to captain
harvilles sister and was now mourning her loss </s>
<s>   they had been a year
or two waiting for fortune and promotion </s>
<s>   fortune came his
prizemoney as lieutenant being great </s>
<s>  promotion too came at last </s>
<s> 
but fanny harville did not live to know it </s>
<s>   she had died the preceding
summer while he was at sea </s>
<s>   captain wentworth believed it impossible
for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to
fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful
change </s>
<s>   he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer
heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring
manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary pursuits </s>
<s>   to
finish the interest of the story the friendship between him and the
harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all
their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them
entirely </s>
<s>   captain harville had taken his present house for half a
year </s>
<s>  his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to
a residence inexpensive and by the sea </s>
<s>  and the grandeur of the
country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly
adapted to captain benwicks state of mind </s>
<s>   the sympathy and goodwill
excited towards captain benwick was very great </s>
<s> 

and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the
party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have </s>
<s>   i
cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever </s>
<s>   he is younger than
i am </s>
<s>  younger in feeling if not in fact </s>
<s>  younger as a man </s>
<s>   he will
rally again and be happy with another </s>
<s> 

they all met and were introduced </s>
<s>   captain harville was a tall dark
man with a sensible benevolent countenance </s>
<s>  a little lame </s>
<s>  and from
strong features and want of health looking much older than captain
wentworth </s>
<s>   captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three
and compared with either of them a little man </s>
<s>   he had a pleasing
face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from
conversation </s>
<s> 

captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners
was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging </s>
<s>   mrs harville
a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the
same good feelings </s>
<s>  and nothing could be more pleasant than their
desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because
the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their
entreaties for their all promising to dine with them </s>
<s>   the dinner
already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted
as a excuse </s>
<s>  but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should
have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing
of course that they should dine with them </s>
<s> 

there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such
a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike
the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners of formality
and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by
an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers </s>
<s>   these would
have been all my friends was her thought </s>
<s>  and she had to struggle
against a great tendency to lowness </s>
<s> 

on quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many </s>
<s>   anne had a moments
astonishment on the subject herself </s>
<s>  but it was soon lost in the
pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious
contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the
actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of
lodginghouse furniture and defend the windows and doors against the
winter storms to be expected </s>
<s>   the varieties in the fittingup of the
rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the
common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a
rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious
and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had
visited were more than amusing to anne </s>
<s>  connected as it all was with
his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence
on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it
presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification </s>
<s> 

captain harville was no reader </s>
<s>  but he had contrived excellent
accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable
collection of wellbound volumes the property of captain benwick </s>
<s>   his
lameness prevented him from taking much exercise </s>
<s>  but a mind of
usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment
within </s>
<s>   he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued </s>
<s>  he made toys
for the children </s>
<s>  he fashioned new nettingneedles and pins with
improvements </s>
<s>  and if everything else was done sat down to his large
fishingnet at one corner of the room </s>
<s> 

anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the
house </s>
<s>  and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into
raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy </s>
<s>  their
friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness </s>
<s> 
protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and
warmth than any other set of men in england </s>
<s>  that they only knew how to
live and they only deserved to be respected and loved </s>
<s> 

they went back to dress and dine </s>
<s>  and so well had the scheme answered
already that nothing was found amiss </s>
<s>  though its being so entirely
out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no
expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of
the inn </s>
<s> 

anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being
in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined could
ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the
interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got
beyond was become a mere nothing </s>
<s> 

the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow
but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening </s>
<s>  and he
came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected
it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of
being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers </s>
<s>   he ventured
among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem
fit for the mirth of the party in general </s>
<s> 

while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the
room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed
rather apart with captain benwick </s>
<s>  and a very good impulse of her
nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him </s>
<s>   he was shy and
disposed to abstraction </s>
<s>  but the engaging mildness of her countenance
and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect </s>
<s>  and anne was well
repaid the first trouble of exertion </s>
<s>   he was evidently a young man of
considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry </s>
<s>  and
besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evenings
indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions
had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to
him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling
against affliction which had naturally grown out of their
conversation </s>
<s>   for though shy he did not seem reserved </s>
<s>  it had rather
the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints </s>
<s>  and
having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone
through a brief comparison of opinion as to the firstrate poets
trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be
preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos </s>
<s>  and
moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced he showed himself so
intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and
all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other </s>
<s>  he
repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a
broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so
entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he
did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was
the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who
enjoyed it completely </s>
<s>  and that the strong feelings which alone could
estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but
sparingly </s>
<s> 

his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his
situation she was emboldened to go on </s>
<s>  and feeling in herself the
right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger
allowance of prose in his daily study </s>
<s>  and on being requested to
particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such
collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth
and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse
and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest
examples of moral and religious endurances </s>
<s> 

captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the
interest implied </s>
<s>  and though with a shake of the head and sighs which
declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like
his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to
procure and read them </s>
<s> 

when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of
her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she had never seen before </s>
<s>  nor could she help fearing on more
serious reflection that like many other great moralists and
preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examination </s>

chapter 


anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the
next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast </s>
<s>   they
went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine
southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so
flat a shore admitted </s>
<s>   they praised the morning </s>
<s>  gloried in the sea </s>
<s> 
sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling breezeand were
silent </s>
<s>  till henrietta suddenly began again with

oh </s>
<s>  yesi am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the
seaair always does good </s>
<s>   there can be no doubt of its having been of
the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring
twelvemonth </s>
<s>   he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month
did him more good than all the medicine he took </s>
<s>  and that being by the
sea always makes him feel young again </s>
<s>   now i cannot help thinking it
a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea </s>
<s>   i do think he had
better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme </s>
<s>   do not you anne </s>
<s> 
do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both
for himself and mrs shirley </s>
<s>   she has cousins here you know and many
acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she
would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance
at hand in case of his having another seizure </s>
<s>   indeed i think it
quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley
who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days
in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut
out from all the world </s>
<s>   i wish his friends would propose it to him </s>
<s>   i
really think they ought </s>
<s>   and as to procuring a dispensation there
could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character </s>
<s>   my
only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish </s>
<s> 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions </s>
<s>  overscrupulous i
must say </s>
<s>   do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous </s>
<s>   do not
you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman
sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well
performed by another person </s>
<s>   and at lyme too only seventeen miles
off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was
anything to complain of </s>
<s> 

anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered
into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of
a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower
standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence </s>
<s>   she said
all that was reasonable and proper on the business </s>
<s>  felt the claims of
dr shirley to repose as she ought </s>
<s>  saw how very desirable it was that
he should have some active respectable young man as a resident
curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such
resident curates being married </s>
<s> 

i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish
lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley </s>
<s>   i
have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence
with everybody </s>
<s>   i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to
anything </s>
<s>   i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid
of her because she is so very clever </s>
<s>  but i respect her amazingly and
wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross </s>
<s> 

anne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful and amused
also that the course of events and the new interests of henriettas
views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the
musgrove family </s>
<s>  she had only time however for a general answer and
a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects
suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards
them </s>
<s>   they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be
ready </s>
<s>  but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had
something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her
into the town </s>
<s>   they were all at her disposal </s>
<s> 

when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a
gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew
back and stopped to give them way </s>
<s>   they ascended and passed him </s>
<s>  and
as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her with a
degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of </s>
<s> 
she was looking remarkably well </s>
<s>  her very regular very pretty
features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of
eye which it had also produced </s>
<s>   it was evident that the gentleman
completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly </s>
<s>   captain
wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his
noticing of it </s>
<s>   he gave her a momentary glance a glance of
brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even
i at this moment see something like anne elliot again </s>
<s> 

after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a
little longer they returned to the inn </s>
<s>  and anne in passing
afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had
nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an
adjoining apartment </s>
<s>   she had before conjectured him to be a stranger
like themselves and determined that a welllooking groom who was
strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his
servant </s>
<s>   both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea </s>
<s>   it
was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves </s>
<s>  and this
second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentlemans
looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and
propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good
manners </s>
<s>   he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an
agreeable person </s>
<s>   anne felt that she should like to know who he was </s>
<s> 

they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost
the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to
the window </s>
<s>   it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle but only coming
round from the stableyard to the front door </s>
<s>  somebody must be going
away </s>
<s>   it was driven by a servant in mourning </s>
<s> 

the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare
it with his own </s>
<s>  the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity and
the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the
curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and
civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at
anne it is the very man we passed </s>
<s> 

the miss musgroves agreed to it </s>
<s>  and having all kindly watched him as
far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table </s>
<s> 
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards </s>
<s> 

pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away </s>
<s> 

yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last
night from sidmouth </s>
<s>   dare say you heard the carriage sir while you
were at dinner </s>
<s>  and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and
london </s>
<s> 

elliot </s>
<s>   many had looked on each other and many had repeated the
name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter </s>
<s> 

bless me </s>
<s>  cried mary </s>
<s>  it must be our cousin </s>
<s>  it must be our mr
elliot it must indeed </s>
<s>   charles anne must not it </s>
<s>   in mourning you
see just as our mr elliot must be </s>
<s>   how very extraordinary </s>
<s>   in the
very same inn with us </s>
<s>   anne must not it be our mr elliot </s>
<s>   my
fathers next heir </s>
<s>   pray sir turning to the waiter did not you
hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch
family </s>
<s> 

no maam he did not mention no particular family </s>
<s>  but he said his
master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day </s>
<s> 

there </s>
<s>  you see </s>
<s>  cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said </s>
<s>   heir to
sir walter elliot </s>
<s>   i was sure that would come out if it was so </s>
<s> 
depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to
publish wherever he goes </s>
<s>   but anne only conceive how extraordinary </s>
<s> 
i wish i had looked at him more </s>
<s>   i wish we had been aware in time who
it was that he might have been introduced to us </s>
<s>   what a pity that we
should not have been introduced to each other </s>
<s>   do you think he had the
elliot countenance </s>
<s>   i hardly looked at him i was looking at the
horses </s>
<s>  but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i
wonder the arms did not strike me </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  the greatcoat was hanging over
the panel and hid the arms so it did </s>
<s>  otherwise i am sure i should
have observed them and the livery too </s>
<s>  if the servant had not been in
mourning one should have known him by the livery </s>
<s> 

putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said
captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of
providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin </s>
<s> 

when she could command marys attention anne quietly tried to convince
her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on
such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all
desirable </s>
<s> 

at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to
have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was
undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense </s>
<s>   she would not
upon any account mention her having met with him the second time </s>
<s> 
luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in
their earlier walk but she would have felt quite illused by annes
having actually run against him in the passage and received his very
polite excuses while she had never been near him at all </s>
<s>  no that
cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret </s>
<s> 

of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot the
next time you write to bath </s>
<s>   i think my father certainly ought to hear
of it </s>
<s>  do mention all about him </s>
<s> 

anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she
considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what
ought to be suppressed </s>
<s>   the offence which had been given her father
many years back she knew </s>
<s>  elizabeths particular share in it she
suspected </s>
<s>  and that mr elliots idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt </s>
<s>   mary never wrote to bath herself </s>
<s>  all the toil of
keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell
on anne </s>
<s> 

breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain and
mrs harville and captain benwick </s>
<s>  with whom they had appointed to take
their last walk about lyme </s>
<s>   they ought to be setting off for
uppercross by one and in the meanwhile were to be all together and
out of doors as long as they could </s>
<s> 

anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all
fairly in the street </s>
<s>   their conversation the preceding evening did not
disincline him to seek her again </s>
<s>  and they walked together some time
talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as
before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike
of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general
change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had
captain harville by her side </s>
<s> 

miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much </s>
<s>   i wish he could have such
company oftener </s>
<s>   it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is </s>
<s> 
but what can we do </s>
<s>   we cannot part </s>
<s> 

no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible </s>
<s>  but in
time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction and
you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called
a young mourneronly last summer i understand </s>
<s> 

ay true enough with a deep sigh only june </s>
<s> 

and not known to him perhaps so soon </s>
<s> 

not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape
just made into the grappler </s>
<s>   i was at plymouth dreading to hear of
him </s>
<s>  he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for
portsmouth </s>
<s>   there the news must follow him but who was to tell it </s>
<s> 
not i </s>
<s>   i would as soon have been run up to the yardarm </s>
<s>   nobody could
do it but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth </s>
<s>   the
laconia had come into plymouth the week before </s>
<s>  no danger of her being
sent to sea again </s>
<s>   he stood his chance for the rest </s>
<s>  wrote up for
leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and
day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant
and never left the poor fellow for a week </s>
<s>   thats what he did and
nobody else could have saved poor james </s>
<s>   you may think miss elliot
whether he is dear to us </s>
<s> 

anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to
bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he
spoke again it was of something totally different </s>
<s> 

mrs harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the
direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk </s>
<s>  they
would accompany them to their door and then return and set off
themselves </s>
<s>   by all their calculations there was just time for this </s>
<s> 
but as they drew near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk
along it once more all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so
determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found
would be no difference at all </s>
<s>  so with all the kind leavetaking and
all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be
imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door
and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling to them
to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb </s>
<s> 

anne found captain benwick again drawing near her </s>
<s>   lord byrons dark
blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present
view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention
was possible </s>
<s>   it was soon drawn perforce another way </s>
<s> 

there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant
for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and
all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight
excepting louisa </s>
<s>  she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth </s>
<s> 
in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles </s>
<s>  the
sensation was delightful to her </s>
<s>   the hardness of the pavement for her
feet made him less willing upon the present occasion </s>
<s>  he did it
however </s>
<s>   she was safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment
ran up the steps to be jumped down again </s>
<s>   he advised her against it
thought the jar too great </s>
<s>  but no he reasoned and talked in vain she
smiled and said i am determined i will </s>
<s>  he put out his hands </s>
<s>  she
was too precipitate by half a second she fell on the pavement on the
lower cobb and was taken up lifeless </s>
<s>   there was no wound no blood
no visible bruise </s>
<s>  but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face
was like death </s>
<s>   the horror of the moment to all who stood around </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of
silence </s>
<s>   she is dead </s>
<s>  she is dead </s>
<s>  screamed mary catching hold of
her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him
immoveable </s>
<s>  and in another moment henrietta sinking under the
conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps
but for captain benwick and anne who caught and supported her between
them </s>
<s> 

is there no one to help me </s>
<s>  were the first words which burst from
captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength
were gone </s>
<s> 

go to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him </s>
<s>   i
can support her myself </s>
<s>   leave me and go to him </s>
<s>   rub her hands rub
her temples </s>
<s>  here are salts </s>
<s>  take them take them </s>
<s> 

captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging
himself from his wife they were both with him </s>
<s>  and louisa was raised
up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that
anne had prompted but in vain </s>
<s>  while captain wentworth staggering
against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony

oh god </s>
<s>  her father and mother </s>
<s> 

a surgeon </s>
<s>  said anne </s>
<s> 

he caught the word </s>
<s>  it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only
true true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne
eagerly suggested

captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick </s>
<s>   he knows
where a surgeon is to be found </s>
<s> 

every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a
moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had resigned
the poor corpselike  figure entirely to the brothers care and was
off for the town with the utmost rapidity </s>
<s> 

as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which
of the three who were completely rational was suffering most </s>

wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate brother
hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes from
one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness
the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him for help which he
could not give </s>
<s> 

anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which
instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest
comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to
assuage the feelings of captain wentworth </s>

for directions </s>

anne anne cried charles what is to be done next </s>

captain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her </s>

had not she better be carried to the inn </s>

gently to the inn </s>

yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively
collected and eager to be doing something </s>
<s>   i will carry her myself </s>

by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be
useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady
nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first
report </s>
<s>   to some of the bestlooking of these good people henrietta was
consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless </s>
<s>  and
in this manner anne walking by her side and charles attending to his
wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the
ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they
had passed along </s>
<s> 

they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them </s>
<s>   captain
benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which
showed something to be wrong </s>
<s>  and they had set off immediately
informed and directed as they passed towards the spot </s>
<s>   shocked as
captain harville was he brought senses and nerves that could be
instantly useful </s>
<s>  and a look between him and his wife decided what was
to be done </s>
<s>   she must be taken to their house </s>
<s>  all must go to their
house </s>
<s>  and await the surgeons arrival there </s>
<s>   they would not listen to
scruples </s>
<s>   he was obeyed </s>
<s>  they were all beneath his roof </s>
<s>  and while
louisa under mrs harvilles direction was conveyed up stairs and
given possession of her own bed assistance cordials restoratives
were supplied by her husband to all who needed them </s>
<s> 

louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without
apparent consciousness </s>
<s>   this had been a proof of life however of
service to her sister </s>
<s>  and henrietta though perfectly incapable of
being in the same room with louisa was kept by the agitation of hope
and fear from a return of her own insensibility </s>
<s>   mary too was
growing calmer </s>
<s> 

the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible </s>
<s>   they
were sick with horror while he examined </s>
<s>  but he was not hopeless </s>
<s>   the
head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries
recovered from </s>
<s>   he was by no means hopeless </s>
<s>  he spoke cheerfully </s>
<s> 

that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a
few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most </s>
<s>  and
the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a
few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered may
be conceived </s>
<s> 

the tone the look with which thank god </s>
<s>  was uttered by captain
wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her </s>
<s>  nor the sight
of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded
arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of
his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them </s>
<s> 

louisas limbs had escaped </s>
<s>   there was no injury but to the head </s>
<s> 

it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
done as to their general situation </s>
<s>   they were now able to speak to
each other and consult </s>
<s>   that louisa must remain where she was however
distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such
trouble did not admit a doubt </s>
<s>   her removal was impossible </s>
<s>   the
harvilles silenced all scruples </s>
<s>  and as much as they could all
gratitude </s>
<s>   they had looked forward and arranged everything before the
others began to reflect </s>
<s>   captain benwick must give up his room to
them and get another bed elsewhere </s>
<s>  and the whole was settled </s>
<s>   they
were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more </s>
<s>  and yet
perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room or swinging
a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room
for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay </s>
<s>  though
with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the
least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely </s>
<s>   mrs
harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid who had
lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such
another </s>
<s>   between these two she could want no possible attendance by
day or night </s>
<s>   and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of
feeling irresistible </s>
<s> 

charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in
consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of
perplexity and terror </s>
<s>   uppercross the necessity of some ones going
to uppercross </s>
<s>  the news to be conveyed </s>
<s>  how it could be broken to mr
and mrs musgrove </s>
<s>  the lateness of the morning </s>
<s>  an hour already gone
since they ought to have been off </s>
<s>  the impossibility of being in
tolerable time </s>
<s>  at first they were capable of nothing more to the
purpose than such exclamations </s>
<s>  but after a while captain wentworth
exerting himself said

we must be decided and without the loss of another minute </s>
<s>   every
minute is valuable </s>
<s>   some one must resolve on being off for uppercross
instantly </s>
<s>   musgrove either you or i must go </s>
<s> 

charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away </s>
<s>   he
would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville </s>
<s> 
but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor
would </s>
<s>   so far it was decided </s>
<s>  and henrietta at first declared the
same </s>
<s>   she however was soon persuaded to think differently </s>
<s>   the
usefulness of her staying </s>
<s>   she who had not been able to remain in
louisas room or to look at her without sufferings which made her
worse than helpless </s>
<s>   she was forced to acknowledge that she could do
no good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the
thought of her father and mother she gave it up </s>
<s>  she consented she
was anxious to be at home </s>
<s> 

the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from
louisas room could not but hear what followed for the parlour door
was open </s>
<s> 

then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that you
stay and that i take care of your sister home </s>
<s>   but as to the rest as
to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville i think it need be
only one </s>
<s>   mrs charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to
her children </s>
<s>  but if anne will stay no one so proper so capable as
anne </s>
<s> 

she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so
spoken of </s>
<s>   the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then
appeared </s>
<s> 

you will stay i am sure </s>
<s>  you will stay and nurse her </s>
<s>  cried he
turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which
seemed almost restoring the past </s>
<s>   she coloured deeply and he
recollected himself and moved away </s>
<s>   she expressed herself most
willing ready happy to remain </s>
<s>   it was what she had been thinking
of and wishing to be allowed to do </s>
<s>   a bed on the floor in louisas
room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville would but think so </s>
<s> 

one thing more and all seemed arranged </s>
<s>   though it was rather
desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay </s>
<s>  yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take
them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense </s>
<s>  and captain
wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed that it would be much
better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr musgroves
carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there
would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisas night </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part
and to be soon followed by the two ladies </s>
<s>   when the plan was made
known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it </s>
<s>   she was
so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice in being
expected to go away instead of anne </s>
<s>  anne who was nothing to louisa
while she was her sister and had the best right to stay in henriettas
stead </s>
<s>   why was not she to be as useful as anne </s>
<s>   and to go home
without charles too without her husband </s>
<s>   no it was too unkind </s>
<s>   and
in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as
none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for
it </s>
<s>  the change of mary for anne was inevitable </s>
<s> 

anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and
illjudging claims of mary </s>
<s>  but so it must be and they set off for the
town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick attending
to her </s>
<s>   she gave a moments recollection as they hurried along to
the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in
the morning </s>
<s>   there she had listened to henriettas schemes for dr
shirleys leaving uppercross </s>
<s>  farther on she had first seen mr elliot </s>
<s> 
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or
those who were wrapt up in her welfare </s>
<s> 

captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her </s>
<s>  and united as
they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing
degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that
it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in
waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the
street </s>
<s>  but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of
one sister for the other the change in his countenance the
astonishment the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles
was listened to made but a mortifying reception of anne </s>
<s>  or must at
least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to
louisa </s>
<s> 

she endeavoured to be composed and to be just </s>
<s>   without emulating the
feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on
louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his sake </s>
<s>  and
she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink
unnecessarily from the office of a friend </s>
<s> 

in the meanwhile she was in the carriage </s>
<s>   he had handed them both in
and placed himself between them </s>
<s>  and in this manner under these
circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted
lyme </s>
<s>   how the long stage would pass </s>
<s>  how it was to affect their
manners </s>
<s>  what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not
foresee </s>
<s>   it was all quite natural however </s>
<s>   he was devoted to
henrietta </s>
<s>  always turning towards her </s>
<s>  and when he spoke at all always
with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits </s>
<s>   in
general his voice and manner were studiously calm </s>
<s>   to spare henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle </s>
<s>   once only when she had
been grieving over the last illjudged illfated walk to the cobb
bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he burst forth as
if wholly overcome

dont talk of it dont talk of it he cried </s>
<s>   oh god </s>
<s>  that i had
not given way to her at the fatal moment </s>
<s>   had i done as i ought </s>
<s>   but
so eager and so resolute </s>
<s>  dear sweet louisa </s>
<s> 

anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the
justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and
advantage of firmness of character </s>
<s>  and whether it might not strike him
that like all other qualities of the mind it should have its
proportions and limits </s>
<s>   she thought it could scarcely escape him to
feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of
happiness as a very resolute character </s>
<s> 

they got on fast </s>
<s>   anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and
the same objects so soon </s>
<s>   their actual speed heightened by some dread
of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long as on the day
before </s>
<s>   it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the
neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been total silence among
them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl
over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep </s>
<s> 
when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at
once addressed by captain wentworth </s>
<s>   in a low cautious voice he
said </s>
<s> 

i have been considering what we had best do </s>
<s>   she must not appear at
first </s>
<s>   she could not stand it </s>
<s>   i have been thinking whether you had
not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it
to mr and mrs musgrove </s>
<s>   do you think this is a good plan </s>
<s> 

she did </s>
<s>   he was satisfied and said no more </s>
<s>   but the remembrance of
the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of
deference for her judgement a great pleasure </s>
<s>  and when it became a
sort of parting proof its value did not lessen </s>
<s> 

when the distressing communication at uppercross was over and he had
seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the
daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention
of returning in the same carriage to lyme </s>
<s>  and when the horses were
baited he was off </s>

chapter 


the remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two
days was spent entirely at the mansion house </s>
<s>  and she had the
satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an
immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements for the
future which in mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits
would have been difficulties </s>
<s> 

they had an early account from lyme the next morning </s>
<s>   louisa was much
the same </s>
<s>   no symptoms worse than before had appeared </s>
<s>   charles came a
few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account </s>
<s>   he
was tolerably cheerful </s>
<s>   a speedy cure must not be hoped but
everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted </s>
<s>   in
speaking of the harvilles he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of
their kindness especially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse </s>
<s> 
she really left nothing for mary to do </s>
<s>   he and mary had been
persuaded to go early to their inn last night </s>
<s>   mary had been
hysterical again this morning </s>
<s>   when he came away she was going to
walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good </s>
<s>   he
almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before </s>
<s> 
but the truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do </s>
<s> 

charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father had at
first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent </s>
<s>   it
would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his
own distress </s>
<s>  and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon </s>
<s>   a
chaise was sent for from crewkherne and charles conveyed back a far
more useful person in the old nurserymaid of the family one who
having brought up all the children and seen the very last the
lingering and longpetted master harry sent to school after his
brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and
dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who
consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse
dear miss louisa </s>
<s>   vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred
before to mrs musgrove and henrietta </s>
<s>  but without anne it would hardly
have been resolved on and found practicable so soon </s>
<s> 

they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all the minute
knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain every
twentyfour hours </s>
<s>   he made it his business to go to lyme and his
account was still encouraging </s>
<s>   the intervals of sense and
consciousness were believed to be stronger </s>
<s>   every report agreed in
captain wentworths appearing fixed in lyme </s>
<s> 

anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded </s>
<s> 
what should they do without her </s>
<s>   they were wretched comforters for
one another </s>
<s>   and so much was said in this way that anne thought she
could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to
which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once </s>
<s>   she
had little difficulty </s>
<s>  it was soon determined that they would go </s>
<s>  go
tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it
suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved </s>
<s>   they must be
taking off some trouble from the good people she was with </s>
<s>  they might
at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children </s>
<s>  and in
short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with
what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning
at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations and sending
them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range
of the house was the consequence </s>
<s> 

she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the
very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated
both houses of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character </s>
<s> 
a few days had made a change indeed </s>
<s> 

if louisa recovered it would all be well again </s>
<s>   more than former
happiness would be restored </s>
<s>   there could not be a doubt to her mind
there was none of what would follow her recovery </s>
<s>   a few months hence
and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self
might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was
glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne
elliot </s>
<s> 

an hours complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark
november day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few
objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the
sound of lady russells carriage exceedingly welcome </s>
<s>  and yet though
desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an
adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda
or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of
the village without a saddened heart </s>
<s>   scenes had passed in uppercross
which made it precious </s>
<s>   it stood the record of many sensations of
pain once severe but now softened </s>
<s>  and of some instances of relenting
feeling some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could
never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear </s>
<s>   she
left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had
been </s>
<s> 

anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russells house
in september </s>
<s>   it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its
being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and
escape from </s>
<s>   her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its
mistress </s>
<s> 

there was some anxiety mixed with lady russells joy in meeting her </s>
<s> 
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross </s>
<s>   but happily either anne
was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her so </s>
<s> 
and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the
amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin
and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth
and beauty </s>
<s> 

when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental
change </s>
<s>   the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving
kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to
smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest </s>
<s> 
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath </s>
<s> 
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross </s>
<s>  and when lady
russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her
satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and
her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have
been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme
and louisa musgrove and all her acquaintance there </s>
<s>  how much more
interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and
captain benwick than her own fathers house in camden place or her
own sisters intimacy with mrs clay </s>
<s>   she was actually forced to exert
herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal
solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her </s>
<s> 

there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another
subject </s>
<s>   they must speak of the accident at lyme </s>
<s>   lady russell had
not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of
the whole had burst on her </s>
<s>  but still it must be talked of she must
make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and
captain wentworths name must be mentioned by both </s>
<s>   anne was conscious
of not doing it so well as lady russell </s>
<s>   she could not speak the name
and look straight forward to lady russells eye till she had adopted
the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment
between him and louisa </s>
<s>   when this was told his name distressed her no
longer </s>
<s> 

lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but
internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt
that the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat of
the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed
by a louisa musgrove </s>
<s> 

the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme which
found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought a rather
improving account of louisa </s>
<s>   at the end of that period lady russells
politeness could repose no longer and the fainter selfthreatenings of
the past became in a decided tone i must call on mrs croft </s>
<s>  i really
must call upon her soon </s>
<s>   anne have you courage to go with me and pay
a visit in that house </s>
<s>   it will be some trial to us both </s>
<s> 

anne did not shrink from it </s>
<s>  on the contrary she truly felt as she
said in observing

i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two </s>
<s>  your
feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine </s>
<s>   by remaining in
the neighbourhood i am become inured to it </s>
<s> 

she could have said more on the subject </s>
<s>  for she had in fact so high an
opinion of the crofts and considered her father so very fortunate in
his tenants felt the parish to be so sure of a good example and the
poor of the best attention and relief that however sorry and ashamed
for the necessity of the removal she could not but in conscience feel
that they were gone who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall
had passed into better hands than its owners </s>
<s>   these convictions must
unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind </s>
<s>  but they
precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the
house again and returning through the wellknown apartments </s>
<s> 

in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms
ought to belong only to us </s>
<s>   oh how fallen in their destination </s>
<s>   how
unworthily occupied </s>
<s>   an ancient family to be so driven away </s>
<s> 
strangers filling their place </s>
<s>  no except when she thought of her
mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she
had no sigh of that description to heave </s>
<s> 

mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of
fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving
her in that house there was particular attention </s>
<s> 

the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on
comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each
lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn </s>
<s>  that
captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since
the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not been
able to trace the exact steps of </s>
<s>  had staid a few hours and then
returned again to lyme and without any present intention of quitting
it any more </s>
<s>   he had enquired after her she found particularly </s>
<s>  had
expressed his hope of miss elliots not being the worse for her
exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great </s>
<s>   this was
handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could
have done </s>
<s> 

as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one
style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to
work on ascertained events </s>
<s>  and it was perfectly decided that it had
been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence </s>
<s>  that
its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how
long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she
would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter </s>
<s>   the
admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming

ay a very bad business indeed </s>
<s>   a new sort of way this for a young
fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head is not it
miss elliot </s>
<s>   this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly </s>
<s> 

admiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady
russell but they delighted anne </s>
<s>   his goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible </s>
<s> 

now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a
little reverie to be coming and finding us here </s>
<s>   i had not
recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad </s>
<s>   but now do
not stand upon ceremony </s>
<s>   get up and go over all the rooms in the house
if you like it </s>
<s> 

another time sir i thank you not now </s>
<s> 

well whenever it suits you </s>
<s>   you can slip in from the shrubbery at
any time </s>
<s>  and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by
that door </s>
<s>   a good place is not it </s>
<s>   but checking himself you
will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the
butlers room </s>
<s>   ay so it always is i believe </s>
<s>   one mans ways may be
as good as anothers but we all like our own best </s>
<s>   and so you must
judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the
house or not </s>
<s> 

anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully </s>
<s> 

we have made very few changes either continued the admiral after
thinking a moment </s>
<s>   very few </s>
<s>   we told you about the laundrydoor at
uppercross </s>
<s>   that has been a very great improvement </s>
<s>   the wonder was
how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its
opening as it did so long </s>
<s>   you will tell sir walter what we have
done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house
ever had </s>
<s>   indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few
alterations we have made have been all very much for the better </s>
<s>   my
wife should have the credit of them however </s>
<s>   i have done very little
besides sending away some of the large lookingglasses from my
dressingroom which was your fathers </s>
<s>   a very good man and very much
the gentleman i am sure </s>
<s>  but i should think miss elliot looking
with serious reflection i should think he must be rather a dressy
man for his time of life </s>
<s>   such a number of lookingglasses </s>
<s>  oh lord </s>
<s> 
there was no getting away from ones self </s>
<s>   so i got sophy to lend me a
hand and we soon shifted their quarters </s>
<s>  and now i am quite snug with
my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i
never go near </s>
<s> 

anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up
the subject again to say

the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give
him my compliments and mrs crofts and say that we are settled here
quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place </s>
<s> 
the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only
when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three
times a winter </s>
<s>   and take it altogether now that we have been into
most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we
like better than this </s>
<s>   pray say so with my compliments </s>
<s>   he will be
glad to hear it </s>
<s> 

lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other </s>
<s>  but
the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at
present </s>
<s>  for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to
be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north
of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady
russell would be removing to bath </s>
<s> 

so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch
hall or of seeing him in company with her friend </s>
<s>   everything was safe
enough and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on
the subject </s>

chapter 


though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and
mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been at all
wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again </s>
<s>  and
as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to
the lodge </s>
<s>   they had left louisa beginning to sit up </s>
<s>  but her head
though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the
highest extreme of tenderness </s>
<s>  and though she might be pronounced to be
altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she
might be able to bear the removal home </s>
<s>  and her father and mother who
must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas
holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them </s>
<s> 

they had been all in lodgings together </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove had got mrs
harvilles children away as much as she could every possible supply
from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience to the
harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner
every day </s>
<s>  and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each
side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable </s>
<s> 

mary had had her evils </s>
<s>  but upon the whole as was evident by her
staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer </s>
<s>   charles
hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her </s>
<s>  and when they dined
with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait and at
first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence </s>
<s>  but then
she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out
whose daughter she was and there had been so much going on every day
there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles
and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that
the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme </s>
<s>   she had been
taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church
and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at
lyme than at uppercross </s>
<s>  and all this joined to the sense of being so
very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight </s>
<s> 

anne enquired after captain benwick </s>
<s>  marys face was clouded directly </s>
<s> 
charles laughed </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd
young man </s>
<s>   i do not know what he would be at </s>
<s>   we asked him to come
home with us for a day or two </s>
<s>   charles undertook to give him some
shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it
was all settled </s>
<s>  when behold </s>
<s>  on tuesday night he made a very awkward
sort of excuse </s>
<s>  he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood
and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it
was i found that he did not mean to come </s>
<s>   i suppose he was afraid of
finding it dull </s>
<s>  but upon my word i should have thought we were lively
enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as captain benwick </s>
<s> 

charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well how it
really was </s>
<s>   it was all your doing turning to anne </s>
<s>  he fancied
that if he went with us he should find you close by </s>
<s>  he fancied
everybody to be living in uppercross </s>
<s>  and when he discovered that lady
russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not
courage to come </s>
<s>   that is the fact upon my honour </s>
<s>  mary knows it is </s>
<s> 

but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not
considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in
love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe anne a greater
attraction to uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed </s>
<s> 
annes goodwill however was not to be lessened by what she heard </s>
<s> 
she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he talks of you cried charles in such terms mary
interrupted him </s>
<s>  i declare charles i never heard him mention anne
twice all the time i was there </s>
<s>   i declare anne he never talks of you
at all </s>
<s> 

no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general
way </s>
<s>  but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you
exceedingly </s>
<s>   his head is full of some books that he is reading upon
your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them </s>
<s>  he has
found out something or other in one of them which he thinksoh </s>
<s>  i
cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very finei
overheard him telling henrietta all about it </s>
<s>  and then miss elliot
was spoken of in the highest terms </s>
<s>   now mary i declare it was so i
heard it myself and you were in the other room </s>
<s>   elegance sweetness
beauty </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  there was no end of miss elliots charms </s>
<s> 

and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his
credit if he did </s>
<s>   miss harville only died last june </s>
<s>   such a heart is
very little worth having </s>
<s>  is it lady russell </s>
<s>   i am sure you will
agree with me </s>
<s> 

i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell
smiling </s>
<s> 

and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam
said charles </s>
<s>   though he had not nerves for coming away with us and
setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make
his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it </s>
<s>   i
told him the distance and the road and i told him of the churchs
being so very well worth seeing </s>
<s>  for as he has a taste for those sort
of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with
all his understanding and soul </s>
<s>  and i am sure from his manner that you
will have him calling here soon </s>
<s>   so i give you notice lady russell </s>
<s> 

any acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me was lady
russells kind answer </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather
my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last
fortnight </s>
<s> 

well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see
captain benwick </s>
<s> 

you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam </s>
<s> 
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived </s>
<s>   he has walked with
me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a
word </s>
<s>   he is not at all a wellbred young man </s>
<s>   i am sure you will not
like him </s>
<s> 

there we differ mary said anne </s>
<s>   i think lady russell would like
him </s>
<s>   i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she
would very soon see no deficiency in his manner </s>
<s> 

so do i anne said charles </s>
<s>   i am sure lady russell would like him </s>
<s> 
he is just lady russells sort </s>
<s>   give him a book and he will read all
day long </s>
<s> 

yes that he will </s>
<s>  exclaimed mary tauntingly </s>
<s>   he will sit poring
over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one
drops ones scissors or anything that happens </s>
<s>   do you think lady
russell would like that </s>
<s> 

lady russell could not help laughing </s>
<s>   upon my word said she i
should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted
of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may
call myself </s>
<s>   i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give
occasion to such directly opposite notions </s>
<s>   i wish he may be induced
to call here </s>
<s>   and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my
opinion </s>
<s>  but i am determined not to judge him beforehand </s>
<s> 

you will not like him i will answer for it </s>
<s> 

lady russell began talking of something else </s>
<s>   mary spoke with
animation of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so
extraordinarily </s>
<s> 

he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see </s>
<s>   his
declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left
a very strong impression in his disfavour with me </s>
<s> 

this decision checked marys eagerness and stopped her short in the
midst of the elliot countenance </s>
<s> 

with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries
there was voluntary communication sufficient </s>
<s>   his spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected </s>
<s>   as louisa improved he
had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he
had been the first week </s>
<s>   he had not seen louisa </s>
<s>  and was so extremely
fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did
not press for it at all </s>
<s>  and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of
going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger </s>
<s>   he had
talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade
captain benwick to go with him </s>
<s>  but as charles maintained to the last
captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch </s>
<s> 

there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally
thinking of captain benwick from this time </s>
<s>   lady russell could not
hear the doorbell without feeling that it might be his herald </s>
<s>  nor
could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her
fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village without
wondering whether she might see him or hear of him </s>
<s>   captain benwick
came not however </s>
<s>   he was either less disposed for it than charles had
imagined or he was too shy </s>
<s>  and after giving him a weeks indulgence
lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had
been beginning to excite </s>
<s> 

the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
school bringing with them mrs harvilles little children to improve
the noise of uppercross and lessen that of lyme </s>
<s>   henrietta remained
with louisa </s>
<s>  but all the rest of the family were again in their usual
quarters </s>
<s> 

lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once when anne
could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again </s>
<s> 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain
wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could
be wished to the last state she had seen it in </s>
<s> 

immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom
she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from
the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them </s>
<s>   on one side was a table
occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper </s>
<s>  and
on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn
and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel </s>
<s>  the whole
completed by a roaring christmas fire which seemed determined to be
heard in spite of all the noise of the others </s>
<s>   charles and mary also
came in of course during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of
paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten
minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the
children on his knees generally in vain </s>
<s>   it was a fine familypiece </s>
<s> 

anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a
domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which louisas
illness must have so greatly shaken </s>
<s>   but mrs musgrove who got anne
near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for
all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what
she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the
room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do
her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home </s>
<s> 

louisa was now recovering apace </s>
<s>   her mother could even think of her
being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters
went to school again </s>
<s>   the harvilles had promised to come with her and
stay at uppercross whenever she returned </s>
<s>   captain wentworth was gone
for the present to see his brother in shropshire </s>
<s> 

i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the
christmas holidays </s>
<s> 

everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters </s>
<s>  and
sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather
than their quantity </s>
<s>   when lady russell not long afterwards was
entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course
of streets from the old bridge to camden place amidst the dash of
other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays the bawling of
newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless clink of
pattens she made no complaint </s>
<s>   no these were noises which belonged
to the winter pleasures </s>
<s>  her spirits rose under their influence </s>
<s>  and
like mrs musgrove she was feeling though not saying that after being
long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet
cheerfulness </s>
<s> 

anne did not share these feelings </s>
<s>   she persisted in a very determined
though very silent disinclination for bath </s>
<s>  caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing
them better </s>
<s>  felt their progress through the streets to be however
disagreeable yet too rapid </s>
<s>  for who would be glad to see her when she
arrived </s>
<s>   and looked back with fond regret to the bustles of
uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch </s>
<s> 

elizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some
interest </s>
<s>   mr elliot was in bath </s>
<s>   he had called in camden place </s>
<s>  had
called a second time a third </s>
<s>  had been pointedly attentive </s>
<s>   if
elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking
much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the
connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect </s>
<s>   this was
very wonderful if it were true </s>
<s>  and lady russell was in a state of very
agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting
the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man
whom she had no wish to see </s>
<s>   she had a great wish to see him </s>
<s>   if he
really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be
forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree </s>
<s> 

anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she
felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more
than she could say for many other persons in bath </s>
<s> 

she was put down in camden place </s>
<s>  and lady russell then drove to her
own lodgings in rivers street </s>
<s> 



chapter 


sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place a lofty
dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence </s>
<s>  and both he
and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction </s>
<s> 

anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment of
many months and anxiously saying to herself oh </s>
<s>  when shall i leave
you again </s>
<s>   a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome
she received did her good </s>
<s>   her father and sister were glad to see
her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her
with kindness </s>
<s>   her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was
noticed as an advantage </s>
<s> 

mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and
smiles were more a matter of course </s>
<s>   anne had always felt that she
would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of
the others was unlooked for </s>
<s>   they were evidently in excellent spirits
and she was soon to listen to the causes </s>
<s>   they had no inclination to
listen to her </s>
<s>   after laying out for some compliments of being deeply
regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they
had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be all
their own </s>
<s>   uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little </s>
<s>  it
was all bath </s>
<s> 

they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect </s>
<s>   their house was undoubtedly the
best in camden place </s>
<s>  their drawingrooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the
superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup or the taste
of the furniture </s>
<s>   their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after </s>
<s> 
everybody was wanting to visit them </s>
<s>   they had drawn back from many
introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people
of whom they knew nothing </s>
<s> 

here were funds of enjoyment </s>
<s>   could anne wonder that her father and
sister were happy </s>
<s>   she might not wonder but she must sigh that her
father should feel no degradation in his change should see nothing to
regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder should
find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town </s>
<s>  and she must
sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the
foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom to the
other boasting of their space </s>
<s>  at the possibility of that woman who
had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of
between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder </s>
<s> 

but this was not all which they had to make them happy </s>
<s>   they had mr
elliot too </s>
<s>   anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot </s>
<s>   he was not
only pardoned they were delighted with him </s>
<s>   he had been in bath about
a fortnight </s>
<s>  he had passed through bath in november in his way to
london when the intelligence of sir walters being settled there had
of course reached him though only twentyfour hours in the place but
he had not been able to avail himself of it </s>
<s>  but he had now been a
fortnight in bath and his first object on arriving had been to leave
his card in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours
to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct
such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be
received as a relation again that their former good understanding was
completely reestablished </s>
<s> 

they had not a fault to find in him </s>
<s>   he had explained away all the
appearance of neglect on his own side </s>
<s>   it had originated in
misapprehension entirely </s>
<s>   he had never had an idea of throwing himself
off </s>
<s>  he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and
delicacy had kept him silent </s>
<s>   upon the hint of having spoken
disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he
was quite indignant </s>
<s>   he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and
whose feelings as to connection were only too strict to suit the
unfeudal tone of the present day </s>
<s>   he was astonished indeed but his
character and general conduct must refute it </s>
<s>   he could refer sir
walter to all who knew him </s>
<s>  and certainly the pains he had been taking
on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the
footing of a relation and heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his
opinions on the subject </s>
<s> 

the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much
extenuation </s>
<s>   this was an article not to be entered on by himself </s>
<s>  but
a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable
man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man sir walter
added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and
had at his own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance
through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the
marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it </s>
<s> 

colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also
with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story </s>
<s>   she was
certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich
and excessively in love with his friend </s>
<s>   there had been the charm </s>
<s> 
she had sought him </s>
<s>   without that attraction not all her money would
have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover assured of her
having been a very fine woman </s>
<s>   here was a great deal to soften the
business </s>
<s>   a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him </s>
<s> 
sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology </s>
<s>  and though elizabeth
could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she
allowed it be a great extenuation </s>
<s> 

mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently
delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners
in general </s>
<s>  delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and
placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place </s>
<s> 

anne listened but without quite understanding it </s>
<s>   allowances large
allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke </s>
<s> 
she heard it all under embellishment </s>
<s>   all that sounded extravagant or
irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators </s>
<s>   still however she had the
sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in
mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years to be well
received by them </s>
<s>   in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being
on terms with sir walter </s>
<s>  nothing to risk by a state of variance </s>
<s>   in
all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch
estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title </s>
<s>   a sensible man
and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object
to him </s>
<s>   she could only offer one solution </s>
<s>  it was perhaps for
elizabeths sake </s>
<s>   there might really have been a liking formerly
though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way </s>
<s>  and now
that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his
addresses to her </s>
<s>   elizabeth was certainly very handsome with
wellbred elegant manners and her character might never have been
penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young
himself </s>
<s>   how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation
of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a
fearful one </s>
<s>   most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too
nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object </s>
<s>  and that elizabeth
was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs clay was
encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them
while mr elliots frequent visits were talked of </s>
<s> 

anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without
being much attended to </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  yes perhaps it had been mr elliot </s>
<s> 
they did not know </s>
<s>   it might be him perhaps </s>
<s>   they could not listen
to her description of him </s>
<s>   they were describing him themselves </s>
<s>  sir
walter especially </s>
<s>   he did justice to his very gentlemanlike
appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face his
sensible eye </s>
<s>  but at the same time must lament his being very much
underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased </s>
<s>  nor could he
pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for
the worse </s>
<s>   mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter was
looking exactly as he had done when they last parted </s>
<s>  but sir walter
had not been able to return the compliment entirely which had
embarrassed him </s>
<s>   he did not mean to complain however </s>
<s>   mr elliot was
better to look at than most men and he had no objection to being seen
with him anywhere </s>
<s> 

mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the
whole evening </s>
<s>   colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
to them </s>
<s>  and mr elliot so anxious that he should </s>
<s>  and there was a mrs
wallis at present known only to them by description as she was in
daily expectation of her confinement </s>
<s>  but mr elliot spoke of her as a
most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and
as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted </s>
<s>   sir walter
thought much of mrs wallis </s>
<s>  she was said to be an excessively pretty
woman beautiful </s>
<s>   he longed to see her </s>
<s>   he hoped she might make some
amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the
streets </s>
<s>   the worst of bath was the number of its plain women </s>
<s>   he did
not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the
plain was out of all proportion </s>
<s>   he had frequently observed as he
walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or
fiveandthirty frights </s>
<s>  and once as he had stood in a shop on bond
street he had counted eightyseven women go by one after another
without there being a tolerable face among them </s>
<s>   it had been a frosty
morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a
thousand could stand the test of </s>
<s>   but still there certainly were a
dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath </s>
<s>  and as for the men </s>
<s>   they
were infinitely worse </s>
<s>   such scarecrows as the streets were full of </s>
<s> 
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced </s>
<s>   he
had never walked anywhere arminarm with colonel wallis who was a
fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing that every
womans eye was upon him </s>
<s>  every womans eye was sure to be upon colonel
wallis </s>
<s>   modest sir walter </s>
<s>   he was not allowed to escape however </s>
<s> 
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel walliss
companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly
was not sandyhaired </s>
<s> 

how is mary looking </s>
<s>  said sir walter in the height of his good
humour </s>
<s>   the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that
may not happen every day </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no that must have been quite accidental </s>
<s>   in general she has been
in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas </s>
<s> 

if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow
coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse </s>
<s> 

anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown
or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the
door suspended everything </s>
<s>   a knock at the door </s>
<s>  and so late </s>
<s>   it was
ten oclock </s>
<s>   could it be mr elliot </s>
<s>   they knew he was to dine in
lansdown crescent </s>
<s>   it was possible that he might stop in his way home
to ask them how they did </s>
<s>   they could think of no one else </s>
<s>   mrs clay
decidedly thought it mr elliots knock </s>
<s>   mrs clay was right </s>
<s>   with all
the state which a butler and footboy could give mr elliot was ushered
into the room </s>
<s> 

it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress </s>
<s> 
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and
her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he
could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her
friend had taken cold the day before &c </s>
<s>  &c </s>
<s>  which was all as
politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must
follow then </s>
<s>   sir walter talked of his youngest daughter </s>
<s>  mr elliot
must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was
no occasion for remembering mary </s>
<s>  and anne smiling and blushing very
becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no
means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement at his little start
of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who she was </s>
<s>   he
looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased </s>
<s>  his
eyes brightened </s>
<s>  and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the
relationship alluded to the past and entreated to be received as an
acquaintance already </s>
<s>   he was quite as goodlooking as he had appeared
at lyme his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so
exactly what they ought to be so polished so easy so particularly
agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one
persons manners </s>
<s>   they were not the same but they were perhaps
equally good </s>
<s> 

he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much </s>
<s> 
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man </s>
<s>   ten minutes were
enough to certify that </s>
<s>   his tone his expressions his choice of
subject his knowing where to stop </s>
<s>  it was all the operation of a
sensible discerning mind </s>
<s>   as soon as he could he began to talk to
her of lyme wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but
especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to
be guests in the same inn at the same time </s>
<s>  to give his own route

adjoining theirs </s>

passed and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in

<s>   the elegant little clock on the mantelpiece
had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman was
beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale before mr

camden place could have passed so well </s>

chapter 


there was one point which anne on returning to her family would have
been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots being in love
with elizabeth which was her fathers not being in love with mrs
clay </s>
<s>  and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at
home a few hours </s>
<s>   on going down to breakfast the next morning she
found there had just been a decent pretence on the ladys side of
meaning to leave them </s>
<s>   she could imagine mrs clay to have said that
now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted </s>
<s> 
for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any
reason indeed </s>
<s>   i assure you i feel it none </s>
<s>   she is nothing to me
compared with you </s>
<s>   and she was in full time to hear her father say
my dear madam this must not be </s>
<s>   as yet you have seen nothing of
bath </s>
<s>   you have been here only to be useful </s>
<s>   you must not run away
from us now </s>
<s>   you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the
beautiful mrs wallis </s>
<s>   to your fine mind i well know the sight of
beauty is a real gratification </s>
<s> 

he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised to
see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself </s>
<s>   her
countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness </s>
<s>  but the praise
of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister </s>
<s>   the
lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay </s>
<s> 

in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be
alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks </s>
<s>  he
thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks </s>
<s>  her skin her
complexion greatly improved </s>
<s>  clearer fresher </s>
<s>   had she been using any
thing in particular </s>
<s>   no nothing </s>
<s>   merely gowland he supposed </s>
<s> 
no nothing at all </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  he was surprised at that </s>
<s>  and added
certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are </s>
<s>  you cannot
be better than well </s>
<s>  or i should recommend gowland the constant use of
gowland during the spring months </s>
<s>   mrs clay has been using it at my
recommendation and you see what it has done for her </s>
<s>   you see how it
has carried away her freckles </s>
<s> 

if elizabeth could but have heard this </s>
<s>   such personal praise might
have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne that the
freckles were at all lessened </s>
<s>   but everything must take its chance </s>
<s> 
the evil of a marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also
to marry </s>
<s>   as for herself she might always command a home with lady
russell </s>
<s> 

lady russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point in her intercourse in camden place </s>
<s>   the sight of mrs
clay in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual
provocation to her there </s>
<s>  and vexed her as much when she was away as a
person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and
has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed </s>
<s> 

as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more
indifferent towards the others </s>
<s>   his manners were an immediate
recommendation </s>
<s>  and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully
supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told anne
almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot </s>
<s>  and could not
seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man </s>
<s> 
everything united in him </s>
<s>  good understanding correct opinions
knowledge of the world and a warm heart </s>
<s>   he had strong feelings of
family attachment and family honour without pride or weakness </s>
<s>  he
lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display </s>
<s>  he
judged for himself in everything essential without defying public
opinion in any point of worldly decorum </s>
<s>   he was steady observant
moderate candid </s>
<s>  never run away with by spirits or by selfishness
which fancied itself strong feeling </s>
<s>  and yet with a sensibility to
what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of
domestic life which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent
agitation seldom really possess </s>
<s>   she was sure that he had not been
happy in marriage </s>
<s>   colonel wallis said it and lady russell saw it </s>
<s> 
but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind nor she began pretty
soon to suspect to prevent his thinking of a second choice </s>
<s>   her
satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay </s>
<s> 

it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her
excellent friend could sometimes think differently </s>
<s>  and it did not
surprise her therefore that lady russell should see nothing
suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than
appeared in mr elliots great desire of a reconciliation </s>
<s>   in lady
russells view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature
time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would
very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good
terms with the head of his family </s>
<s>  the simplest process in the world of
time upon a head naturally clear and only erring in the heyday of
youth </s>
<s>   anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to
mention elizabeth </s>
<s>   lady russell listened and looked and made only
this cautious reply </s>
<s> elizabeth </s>
<s>  very well </s>
<s>  time will explain </s>
<s> 

it was a reference to the future which anne after a little
observation felt she must submit to </s>
<s>   she could determine nothing at
present </s>
<s>   in that house elizabeth must be first </s>
<s>  and she was in the
habit of such general observance as miss elliot that any
particularity of attention seemed almost impossible </s>
<s>   mr elliot too
it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months </s>
<s>   a little
delay on his side might be very excusable </s>
<s>   in fact anne could never
see the crape round his hat without fearing that she was the
inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations </s>
<s>  for though
his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many
years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the
awful impression of its being dissolved </s>
<s> 

however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest
acquaintance in bath </s>
<s>   she saw nobody equal to him </s>
<s>  and it was a great
indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme which he seemed to
have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself </s>
<s> 
they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many
times </s>
<s>   he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some
earnestness </s>
<s>   she knew it well </s>
<s>  and she remembered another persons
look also </s>
<s> 

they did not always think alike </s>
<s>   his value for rank and connexion she
perceived was greater than hers </s>
<s>   it was not merely complaisance it
must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her
father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy
to excite them </s>
<s>   the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of
the dowager viscountess dalrymple and her daughter the honourable
miss carteret </s>
<s>  and all the comfort of no </s>
<s>   camden place was swept
away for many days </s>
<s>  for the dalrymples in annes opinion most
unfortunately were cousins of the elliots </s>
<s>  and the agony was how to
introduce themselves properly </s>
<s> 

anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with
nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed </s>
<s>   she had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and
was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen </s>
<s>  a wish that
they had more pride </s>
<s>  for our cousins lady dalrymple and miss
carteret </s>
<s>  our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears all day
long </s>
<s> 

sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had
never seen any of the rest of the family </s>
<s>  and the difficulties of the
case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by
letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount
when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters at the same
time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch </s>
<s>   no letter of
condolence had been sent to ireland </s>
<s>   the neglect had been visited on
the head of the sinner </s>
<s>  for when poor lady elliot died herself no
letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there
was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the
relationship as closed </s>
<s>   how to have this anxious business set to
rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question </s>
<s>   and it was
a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor
mr elliot thought unimportant </s>
<s>   family connexions were always worth
preserving good company always worth seeking </s>
<s>  lady dalrymple had taken
a house for three months in laura place and would be living in
style </s>
<s>   she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had
heard her spoken of as a charming woman </s>
<s>   it was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots </s>
<s> 

sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a
very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty to his
right honourable cousin </s>
<s>   neither lady russell nor mr elliot could
admire the letter </s>
<s>  but it did all that was wanted in bringing three
lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess </s>
<s>   she was very much
honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance </s>
<s>  the toils of the
business were over the sweets began </s>
<s>   they visited in laura place
they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable
miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible </s>
<s>   and
our cousins in laura placeour cousin lady dalrymple and miss
carteret were talked of to everybody </s>
<s> 

anne was ashamed </s>
<s>   had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very
agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they
created but they were nothing </s>
<s>   there was no superiority of manner
accomplishment or understanding </s>
<s>   lady dalrymple had acquired the name
of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for
everybody </s>
<s>   miss carteret with still less to say was so plain and so
awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but
for her birth </s>
<s> 

lady russell confessed she had expected something better </s>
<s>  but yet it
was an acquaintance worth having </s>
<s>  and when anne ventured to speak her
opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in
themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good
company as those who would collect good company around them they had
their value </s>
<s>   anne smiled and said

my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever
wellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation </s>
<s>  that is
what i call good company </s>
<s> 

you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company </s>
<s>  that is
the best </s>
<s>   good company requires only birth education and manners
and with regard to education is not very nice </s>
<s>   birth and good manners
are essential </s>
<s>  but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
in good company </s>
<s>  on the contrary it will do very well </s>
<s>   my cousin anne
shakes her head </s>
<s>   she is not satisfied </s>
<s>   she is fastidious </s>
<s>   my dear
cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be
fastidious than almost any other woman i know </s>
<s>  but will it answer </s>
<s> 
will it make you happy </s>
<s>   will it not be wiser to accept the society of
those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the
connexion as far as possible </s>
<s>   you may depend upon it that they will
move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your
being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your
family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we
must all wish for </s>
<s> 

yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them </s>
<s> 
then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added
i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to
procure the acquaintance </s>
<s>   i suppose smiling i have more pride than
any of you </s>
<s>  but i confess it does vex me that we should be so
solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very
sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them </s>
<s> 

pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims </s>
<s>   in london
perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say </s>
<s> 
but in bath </s>
<s>  sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth
knowing </s>
<s>   always acceptable as acquaintance </s>
<s> 

well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place </s>
<s> 

i love your indignation said he </s>
<s>  it is very natural </s>
<s>   but here you
are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the
credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot </s>
<s>   you
talk of being proud </s>
<s>  i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to
believe myself otherwise </s>
<s>  for our pride if investigated would have
the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little
different </s>
<s>   in one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued
speaking lower though there was no one else in the room in one
point i am sure we must feel alike </s>
<s>   we must feel that every addition
to your fathers society among his equals or superiors may be of use
in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him </s>
<s> 

he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been lately
occupying </s>
<s>   a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant </s>
<s>  and
though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride
she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay </s>
<s>  and her conscience
admitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting great
acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her </s>
<s> 



chapter 


while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good
fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very
different description </s>
<s> 

she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there
being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claims on
her attention of past kindness and present suffering </s>
<s>   miss hamilton
now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her
life when it had been most valuable </s>
<s>   anne had gone unhappy to school
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved feeling
her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen of
strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time </s>
<s> 
and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the
want of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at
school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably
lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference </s>
<s> 

miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was
said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had
known of her till now that their governesss account brought her
situation forward in a more decided but very different form </s>
<s> 

she was a widow and poor </s>
<s>   her husband had been extravagant </s>
<s>  and at his
death about two years before had left his affairs dreadfully
involved </s>
<s>   she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and
in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for
the present a cripple </s>
<s>   she had come to bath on that account and was
now in lodgings near the hot baths living in a very humble way unable
even to afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost
excluded from society </s>
<s> 

their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from
miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in
going </s>
<s>   she mentioned nothing of what she had heard or what she
intended at home </s>
<s>   it would excite no proper interest there </s>
<s>   she only
consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and
was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smiths lodgings in
westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken </s>
<s> 

the visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest
in each other more than rekindled </s>
<s>   the first ten minutes had its
awkwardness and its emotion </s>
<s>   twelve years were gone since they had
parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the
other had imagined </s>
<s>   twelve years had changed anne from the blooming
silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant little woman of
sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom and with manners as
consciously right as they were invariably gentle </s>
<s>  and twelve years had
transformed the finelooking wellgrown miss hamilton in all the glow
of health and confidence of superiority into a poor infirm helpless
widow receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour </s>
<s>  but all
that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away and left
only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and
talking over old times </s>
<s> 

anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she
had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be
cheerful beyond her expectation </s>
<s>   neither the dissipations of the
pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions of
the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her
heart or ruined her spirits </s>
<s> 

in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and
annes astonishment increased </s>
<s>   she could scarcely imagine a more
cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths </s>
<s>   she had been very fond
of her husband </s>
<s>   she had buried him </s>
<s>   she had been used to affluence </s>
<s> 
it was gone </s>
<s>   she had no child to connect her with life and happiness
again no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs
no health to make all the rest supportable </s>
<s>   her accommodations were
limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no
possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which
there was only one servant in the house to afford and she never
quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath </s>
<s>   yet in spite
of all this anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of
languor and depression to hours of occupation and enjoyment </s>
<s>   how
could it be </s>
<s>   she watched observed reflected and finally determined
that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only </s>
<s>   a
submissive spirit might be patient a strong understanding would supply
resolution but here was something more </s>
<s>  here was that elasticity of
mind that disposition to be comforted that power of turning readily
from evil to good and of finding employment which carried her out of
herself which was from nature alone </s>
<s>   it was the choicest gift of
heaven </s>
<s>  and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which
by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost
every other want </s>
<s> 

there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly
failed </s>
<s>   she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her
state on first reaching bath </s>
<s>   then she had indeed been a pitiable
object </s>
<s>  for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken
possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and
suffering under severe and constant pain </s>
<s>  and all this among strangers
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at
that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense </s>
<s>   she
had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her
good </s>
<s>   it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be
in good hands </s>
<s>   she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or
disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her
that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her
ill </s>
<s>  and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister
of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in
that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to
attend her </s>
<s>   and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most
admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance </s>
<s>   as soon as i
could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great
amusement </s>
<s>  and she put me in the way of making these little
threadcases pincushions and cardracks which you always find me so
busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood </s>
<s>   she had a
large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can
afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise </s>
<s>   she always takes
the right time for applying </s>
<s>   everybodys heart is open you know when
they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the
blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to
speak </s>
<s>   she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman </s>
<s>   hers is a line
for seeing human nature </s>
<s>  and she has a fund of good sense and
observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to
thousands of those who having only received the best education in the
world know nothing worth attending to </s>
<s>   call it gossip if you will
but when nurse rooke has half an hours leisure to bestow on me she is
sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable </s>
<s> 
something that makes one know ones species better </s>
<s>   one likes to hear
what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being
trifling and silly </s>
<s>   to me who live so much alone her conversation i
assure you is a treat </s>
<s> 

anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i can easily
believe it </s>
<s>   women of that class have great opportunities and if they
are intelligent may be well worth listening to </s>
<s>   such varieties of
human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing </s>
<s>   and it is not
merely in its follies that they are well read </s>
<s>  for they see it
occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or
affecting </s>
<s>   what instances must pass before them of ardent
disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude
patience resignation </s>
<s>   of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most </s>
<s>   a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of
volumes </s>
<s> 

yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear
its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe </s>
<s>   here and
there human nature may be great in times of trial </s>
<s>  but generally
speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a
sick chamber </s>
<s>   it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
and fortitude that one hears of </s>
<s>   there is so little real friendship
in the world </s>
<s>  and unfortunately speaking low and tremulously there
are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late </s>
<s> 

anne saw the misery of such feelings </s>
<s>   the husband had not been what he
ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made
her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved </s>
<s>   it was but a
passing emotion however with mrs smith </s>
<s>  she shook it off and soon
added in a different tone

i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present
will furnish much either to interest or edify me </s>
<s>   she is only nursing
mrs wallis of marlborough buildings </s>
<s>  a mere pretty silly expensive
fashionable woman i believe </s>
<s>  and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery </s>
<s>   i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis
however </s>
<s>   she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the
highpriced things i have in hand now </s>
<s> 

anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of
such a person was known in camden place </s>
<s>   at last it became necessary
to speak of her </s>
<s>  sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one
morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple
for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that
evening in westgate buildings </s>
<s>   she was not sorry for the excuse </s>

were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at
home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had
been so pressed on her </s>
<s>  and she declined on her own account with great
alacrityshe was engaged to spend the evening with an old
schoolfellow </s>
<s>   they were not much interested in anything relative to
anne </s>
<s>  but still there were questions enough asked to make it
understood what this old schoolfellow was </s>
<s>  and elizabeth was
disdainful and sir walter severe </s>
<s> 

westgate buildings </s>

no sir she is not oneandthirty </s>

she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne </s>

approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs

heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening </s>
<s>   she had
been the only one of the set absent for sir walter and elizabeth had
not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves but had
actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had
been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot </s>
<s>  and mr
elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early and lady
russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait
on her </s>
<s>   anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could
supply from lady russell </s>
<s>   to her its greatest interest must be in
having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot </s>
<s>  in
having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for
staying away in such a cause </s>
<s>   her kind compassionate visits to this
old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr
elliot </s>
<s>   he thought her a most extraordinary young woman </s>
<s>  in her
temper manners mind a model of female excellence </s>
<s>   he could meet
even lady russell in a discussion of her merits </s>
<s>  and anne could not be
given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be
so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable
sensations which her friend meant to create </s>
<s> 

lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot </s>
<s> 
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his
deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which
would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood and
leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing </s>
<s>   she
would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the
subject she would venture on little more than hints of what might be
hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness
of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned </s>
<s> 
anne heard her and made no violent exclamations </s>
<s>  she only smiled
blushed and gently shook her head </s>
<s> 

i am no matchmaker as you well know said lady russell being much
too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations </s>
<s> 
i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses
to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there
would be every possibility of your being happy together </s>
<s>   a most
suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be
a very happy one </s>
<s> 

mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i
think highly of him said anne </s>
<s>  but we should not suit </s>
<s> 

lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that to
be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future
lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mothers
place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as
to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me </s>
<s> 
you are your mothers self in countenance and disposition </s>
<s>  and if i
might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name
and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to
her in being more highly valued </s>
<s>   my dearest anne it would give me
more delight than is often felt at my time of life </s>
<s> 

anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table
and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited </s>
<s>   for a few moments her imagination and her heart
were bewitched </s>
<s>   the idea of becoming what her mother had been </s>
<s>  of
having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself </s>
<s>  of
being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for
ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist </s>
<s>   lady russell
said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own
operation </s>
<s>  and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with
propriety have spoken for himself </s>
<s> she believed in short what anne
did not believe </s>
<s>   the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself
brought anne to composure again </s>
<s>   the charm of kellynch and of lady
elliot all faded away </s>
<s>   she never could accept him </s>
<s>   and it was not
only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one </s>
<s>  her
judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a
case was against mr elliot </s>
<s> 

though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied
that she really knew his character </s>
<s>   that he was a sensible man an
agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to
judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough </s>
<s> 
he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article
of moral duty evidently transgressed </s>
<s>  but yet she would have been
afraid to answer for his conduct </s>
<s>   she distrusted the past if not the
present </s>
<s>   the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the
allusions to former practices and pursuits suggested suspicions not
favourable of what he had been </s>
<s>   she saw that there had been bad
habits </s>
<s>  that sunday travelling had been a common thing </s>
<s>  that there had
been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had
been at least careless in all serious matters </s>
<s>  and though he might
now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of
a clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair
character </s>
<s>   how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly
cleansed </s>
<s> 

mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open </s>
<s>   there
was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight
at the evil or good of others </s>
<s>   this to anne was a decided
imperfection </s>
<s>   her early impressions were incurable </s>
<s>   she prized the
frank the openhearted the eager character beyond all others </s>
<s>   warmth
and enthusiasm did captivate her still </s>
<s>   she felt that she could so
much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or
said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind
never varied whose tongue never slipped </s>
<s> 

mr elliot was too generally agreeable </s>
<s>   various as were the tempers in
her fathers house he pleased them all </s>
<s>   he endured too well stood
too well with every body </s>
<s>   he had spoken to her with some degree of
openness of mrs clay </s>
<s>  had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was
about and to hold her in contempt </s>
<s>  and yet mrs clay found him as
agreeable as any body </s>
<s> 

lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw
nothing to excite distrust </s>
<s>   she could not imagine a man more exactly
what he ought to be than mr elliot </s>
<s>  nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter
feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved
anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn </s>

chapter 


it was the beginning of february </s>
<s>  and anne having been a month in
bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme </s>
<s>   she
wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated </s>
<s>   it was three
weeks since she had heard at all </s>
<s>   she only knew that henrietta was at
home again </s>
<s>  and that louisa though considered to be recovering fast
was still in lyme </s>
<s>  and she was thinking of them all very intently one
evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to
her </s>
<s>  and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and mrs
crofts compliments </s>
<s> 

the crofts must be in bath </s>
<s>   a circumstance to interest her </s>
<s>   they were
people whom her heart turned to very naturally </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s>  cried sir walter </s>
<s>   the crofts have arrived in bath </s>
<s> 
the crofts who rent kellynch </s>
<s>   what have they brought you </s>
<s> 

a letter from uppercross cottage sir </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  those letters are convenient passports </s>
<s>   they secure an
introduction </s>
<s>   i should have visited admiral croft however at any
rate </s>
<s>   i know what is due to my tenant </s>
<s> 

anne could listen no longer </s>
<s>  she could not even have told how the poor
admirals complexion escaped </s>
<s>  her letter engrossed her </s>
<s>   it had been
begun several days back </s>
<s> 


february st </s>
<s> 

my dear annei make no apology for my silence because i know how
little people think of letters in such a place as bath </s>
<s>   you must be a
great deal too happy to care for uppercross which as you well know
affords little to write about </s>
<s>   we have had a very dull christmas </s>
<s>  mr
and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays </s>
<s>   i do
not reckon the hayters as anybody </s>
<s>   the holidays however are over at
last </s>
<s>   i believe no children ever had such long ones </s>
<s>   i am sure i had
not </s>
<s>   the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles </s>
<s> 
but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home </s>
<s>   mrs
harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long </s>
<s>   i do not
understand it </s>
<s>   they are not at all nice children in my opinion </s>
<s>  but
mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her
grandchildren </s>
<s>   what dreadful weather we have had </s>
<s>   it may not be felt
in bath with your nice pavements </s>
<s>  but in the country it is of some
consequence </s>
<s>   i have not had a creature call on me since the second
week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much
oftener than was welcome </s>
<s>   between ourselves i think it a great pity
henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa </s>
<s>  it would have kept
her a little out of his way </s>
<s>   the carriage is gone today to bring
louisa and the harvilles tomorrow </s>
<s>   we are not asked to dine with
them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her
being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering
the care that will be taken of her </s>
<s>  and it would be much more
convenient to me to dine there tomorrow </s>
<s>   i am glad you find mr elliot
so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too </s>
<s>  but i have
my usual luck </s>
<s>   i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is
going on </s>
<s>  always the last of my family to be noticed </s>
<s>   what an immense
time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth </s>
<s>   does she never mean to
go away </s>
<s>   but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might
not be invited </s>
<s>   let me know what you think of this </s>
<s>   i do not expect
my children to be asked you know </s>
<s>   i can leave them at the great house
very well for a month or six weeks </s>
<s>   i have this moment heard that the
crofts are going to bath almost immediately </s>
<s>  they think the admiral
gouty </s>
<s>   charles heard it quite by chance </s>
<s>  they have not had the
civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything </s>
<s>   i do
not think they improve at all as neighbours </s>
<s>   we see nothing of them
and this is really an instance of gross inattention </s>
<s>   charles joins me
in love and everything proper </s>
<s>   yours affectionately

mary m </s>
<s> 

i am sorry to say that i am very far from well </s>
<s>  and jemima has just
told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat very much
about </s>
<s>   i dare say i shall catch it </s>
<s>  and my sorethroats you know are
always worse than anybodys </s>
<s> 


so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an
envelope containing nearly as much more </s>
<s> 


i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her
journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add </s>
<s> 
in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to
convey anything to you </s>
<s>  a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to
me just as it ought </s>
<s>  i shall therefore be able to make my letter as
long as i like </s>
<s>   the admiral does not seem very ill and i sincerely
hope bath will do him all the good he wants </s>
<s>   i shall be truly glad to
have them back again </s>
<s>   our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant
family </s>
<s>   but now for louisa </s>
<s>   i have something to communicate that will
astonish you not a little </s>
<s>   she and the harvilles came on tuesday very
safely and in the evening we went to ask her how she did when we were
rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party for he had
been invited as well as the harvilles </s>
<s>  and what do you think was the
reason </s>
<s>   neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa and
not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr
musgrove </s>
<s>  for it was all settled between him and her before she came
away and he had written to her father by captain harville </s>
<s>   true upon
my honour </s>
<s>   are not you astonished </s>
<s>   i shall be surprised at least if
you ever received a hint of it for i never did </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove protests
solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter </s>
<s>   we are all very well
pleased however for though it is not equal to her marrying captain
wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter </s>
<s>  and mr musgrove
has written his consent and captain benwick is expected today </s>
<s>   mrs
harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sisters
account </s>
<s>  but however louisa is a great favourite with both </s>
<s>   indeed
mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having
nursed her </s>
<s>   charles wonders what captain wentworth will say </s>
<s>  but if
you remember i never thought him attached to louisa </s>
<s>  i never could see
anything of it </s>
<s>   and this is the end you see of captain benwicks
being supposed to be an admirer of yours </s>
<s>   how charles could take such
a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me </s>
<s>   i hope he
will be more agreeable now </s>
<s>   certainly not a great match for louisa
musgrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayters </s>
<s> 


mary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared for
the news </s>
<s>   she had never in her life been more astonished </s>
<s>   captain
benwick and louisa musgrove </s>
<s>   it was almost too wonderful for belief
and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room
preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the
moment </s>
<s>   happily for her they were not many </s>
<s>   sir walter wanted to
know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they
were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss
elliot and himself to visit in </s>
<s>  but had little curiosity beyond </s>
<s> 

how is mary </s>
<s>  said elizabeth </s>
<s>  and without waiting for an answer and
pray what brings the crofts to bath </s>
<s> 

they come on the admirals account </s>
<s>   he is thought to be gouty </s>
<s> 

gout and decrepitude </s>
<s>  said sir walter </s>
<s>   poor old gentleman </s>
<s> 

have they any acquaintance here </s>
<s>  asked elizabeth </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts time
of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in
such a place as this </s>
<s> 

i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best
known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall </s>
<s>   elizabeth may we
venture to present him and his wife in laura place </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s>  i think not </s>
<s>   situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she
might not approve </s>
<s>   if we were not related it would not signify </s>
<s>  but
as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours </s>
<s>   we
had better leave the crofts to find their own level </s>
<s>   there are several
oddlooking men walking about here who i am told are sailors </s>
<s>   the
crofts will associate with them </s>
<s> 

this was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter </s>
<s> 
when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an
enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was
at liberty </s>
<s> 

in her own room she tried to comprehend it </s>
<s>   well might charles wonder
how captain wentworth would feel </s>
<s>   perhaps he had quitted the field
had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her </s>
<s> 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin
to ill usage between him and his friend </s>
<s>   she could not endure that
such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly </s>
<s> 

captain benwick and louisa musgrove </s>
<s>   the highspirited joyoustalking
louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking feeling reading captain
benwick seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other </s>
<s> 
their minds most dissimilar </s>
<s>   where could have been the attraction </s>
<s> 
the answer soon presented itself </s>
<s>   it had been in situation </s>
<s>   they had
been thrown together several weeks </s>
<s>  they had been living in the same
small family party </s>
<s>   since henriettas coming away they must have been
depending almost entirely on each other and louisa just recovering
from illness had been in an interesting state and captain benwick was
not inconsolable </s>
<s>   that was a point which anne had not been able to
avoid suspecting before </s>
<s>  and instead of drawing the same conclusion as
mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm
the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself </s>
<s> 
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her
vanity than mary might have allowed </s>
<s>   she was persuaded that any
tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for
him would have received the same compliment </s>
<s>   he had an affectionate
heart </s>
<s>   he must love somebody </s>
<s> 

she saw no reason against their being happy </s>
<s>   louisa had fine naval
fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike </s>
<s>   he would
gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott
and lord byron </s>
<s>  nay that was probably learnt already </s>
<s>  of course they
had fallen in love over poetry </s>
<s>   the idea of louisa musgrove turned
into a person of literary taste and sentimental reflection was
amusing but she had no doubt of its being so </s>
<s>   the day at lyme the
fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her
courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it
appeared to have influenced her fate </s>
<s> 

the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been
sensible of captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer
another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting
wonder </s>
<s>  and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly
nothing to be regretted </s>
<s>   no it was not regret which made annes heart
beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when
she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free </s>
<s>   she had some
feelings which she was ashamed to investigate </s>
<s>   they were too much like
joy senseless joy </s>
<s> 

she longed to see the crofts </s>
<s>  but when the meeting took place it was
evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them </s>
<s>   the visit of
ceremony was paid and returned </s>
<s>  and louisa musgrove was mentioned and
captain benwick too without even half a smile </s>
<s> 

the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly
to sir walters satisfaction </s>
<s>   he was not at all ashamed of the
acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about
the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him </s>
<s> 

the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and
considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure </s>
<s>   they brought
with them their country habit of being almost always together </s>
<s>   he was
ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft seemed to go shares
with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good </s>
<s>   anne
saw them wherever she went </s>
<s>   lady russell took her out in her carriage
almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never
failed to see them </s>
<s>   knowing their feelings as she did it was a most
attractive picture of happiness to her </s>
<s>   she always watched them as
long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be
talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally
delighted to see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he
encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her </s>
<s> 

anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking
herself </s>
<s>  but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days
after the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or
her friends carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone
to camden place and in walking up milsom street she had the good
fortune to meet with the admiral </s>
<s>   he was standing by himself at a
printshop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation
of some print and she not only might have passed him unseen but was
obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his
notice </s>
<s>   when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done
with all his usual frankness and good humour </s>
<s>   ha </s>
<s>  is it you </s>
<s>   thank
you thank you </s>
<s>   this is treating me like a friend </s>
<s>   here i am you

<s>   what queer fellows your fine painters must
be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that </s>
<s>   and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it
mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and
mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they
certainly must be </s>
<s>   i wonder where that boat was built </s>
<s>  laughing
heartily </s>
<s>  i would not venture over a horsepond in it </s>
<s>   well
turning away now where are you bound </s>
<s>   can i go anywhere for you

<s>   yes yes we will

along </s>
<s>   there take my arm </s>
<s>  thats right </s>
<s>  i do not feel comfortable if

<s>   lord </s>
<s>  what a boat it is </s>
<s>  taking a last look

<s> 

did you say that you had something to tell me sir </s>
<s> 

yes i have presently </s>
<s>   but here comes a friend captain brigden </s>
<s>  i
shall only say how dye do </s>
<s>  as we pass however </s>
<s>   i shall not stop </s>
<s> 
how dye do </s>
<s>   brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife </s>
<s> 
she poor soul is tied by the leg </s>
<s>   she has a blister on one of her
heels as large as a threeshilling piece </s>
<s>   if you look across the
street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother </s>
<s>   shabby
fellows both of them </s>
<s>   i am glad they are not on this side of the way </s>
<s> 
sophy cannot bear them </s>
<s>   they played me a pitiful trick once </s>
<s>  got away
with some of my best men </s>
<s>   i will tell you the whole story another
time </s>
<s>   there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson </s>
<s>   look he
sees us </s>
<s>  he kisses his hand to you </s>
<s>  he takes you for my wife </s>
<s>   ah </s>
<s>  the
peace has come too soon for that younker </s>
<s>   poor old sir archibald </s>
<s>   how
do you like bath miss elliot </s>
<s>   it suits us very well </s>
<s>   we are always
meeting with some old friend or other </s>
<s>  the streets full of them every
morning </s>
<s>  sure to have plenty of chat </s>
<s>  and then we get away from them
all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and
are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at
north yarmouth and deal </s>
<s>   we do not like our lodgings here the worse i
can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north
yarmouth </s>
<s>   the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same
way </s>
<s> 

when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for
what he had to communicate </s>
<s>   she hoped when clear of milsom street to
have her curiosity gratified </s>
<s>  but she was still obliged to wait for
the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the
greater space and quiet of belmont </s>
<s>  and as she was not really mrs
croft she must let him have his own way </s>
<s>   as soon as they were fairly
ascending belmont he began

well now you shall hear something that will surprise you </s>
<s>   but first
of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk
about </s>
<s>   that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned
for </s>
<s>   the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to </s>
<s>   her
christian name </s>
<s>   i always forget her christian name </s>
<s> 

anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
did </s>
<s>  but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa </s>
<s> 

ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name </s>
<s>   i wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine christian names </s>
<s>   i should never be out
if they were all sophys or something of that sort </s>
<s>   well this miss
louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick </s>
<s>   he was
courting her week after week </s>
<s>   the only wonder was what they could be
waiting for till the business at lyme came </s>
<s>  then indeed it was clear
enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right </s>
<s>   but even
then there was something odd in their way of going on </s>
<s>   instead of
staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see
edward </s>
<s>   when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edwards
and there he has been ever since </s>
<s>   we have seen nothing of him since
november </s>
<s>   even sophy could not understand it </s>
<s>   but now the matter has
taken the strangest turn of all </s>
<s>  for this young lady the same miss
musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james
benwick </s>
<s>   you know james benwick </s>
<s> 

a little </s>
<s>   i am a little acquainted with captain benwick </s>
<s> 

well she is to marry him </s>
<s>   nay most likely they are married already
for i do not know what they should wait for </s>
<s> 

i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne and
i understand that he bears an excellent character </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick </s>
<s> 
he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad
times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of </s>
<s>   an
excellent goodhearted fellow i assure you </s>
<s>  a very active zealous
officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that
soft sort of manner does not do him justice </s>
<s> 

indeed you are mistaken there sir </s>
<s>  i should never augur want of
spirit from captain benwicks manners </s>
<s>   i thought them particularly
pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please </s>
<s> 

well well ladies are the best judges </s>
<s>  but james benwick is rather
too piano for me </s>
<s>  and though very likely it is all our partiality
sophy and i cannot help thinking fredericks manners better than his </s>
<s> 
there is something about frederick more to our taste </s>
<s> 

anne was caught </s>
<s>   she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of
spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to
represent captain benwicks manners as the very best that could
possibly be </s>
<s>  and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say
i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the
admiral interrupted her with

and the thing is certainly true </s>
<s>   it is not a mere bit of gossip </s>
<s>   we
have it from frederick himself </s>
<s>   his sister had a letter from him
yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a
letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross </s>
<s>   i fancy
they are all at uppercross </s>
<s> 

this was an opportunity which anne could not resist </s>
<s>  she said
therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of
captain wentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly
uneasy </s>
<s>   it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment
between him and louisa musgrove </s>
<s>  but i hope it may be understood to
have worn out on each side equally and without violence </s>
<s>   i hope his
letter does not breathe the spirit of an illused man </s>
<s> 

not at all not at all </s>
<s>  there is not an oath or a murmur from
beginning to end </s>
<s> 

anne looked down to hide her smile </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  frederick is not a man to whine and complain </s>
<s>  he has too much
spirit for that </s>
<s>   if the girl likes another man better it is very fit
she should have him </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>   but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in
captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks
himself illused by his friend which might appear you know without
its being absolutely said </s>
<s>   i should be very sorry that such a
friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be
destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort </s>
<s> 

yes yes i understand you </s>
<s>   but there is nothing at all of that
nature in the letter </s>
<s>   he does not give the least fling at benwick </s>
<s> 
does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for
wondering at it </s>
<s>   no you would not guess from his way of writing
that he had ever thought of this miss whats her name </s>
<s>  for himself </s>
<s> 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together </s>
<s>  and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that i think </s>
<s> 

anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to
convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther </s>
<s> 
she therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet
attention and the admiral had it all his own way </s>
<s> 

poor frederick </s>
<s>  said he at last </s>
<s>   now he must begin all over again
with somebody else </s>
<s>   i think we must get him to bath </s>
<s>   sophy must
write and beg him to come to bath </s>
<s>   here are pretty girls enough i am
sure </s>

not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath </s>

chapter 


while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing his
wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth was
already on his way thither </s>
<s>   before mrs croft had written he was
arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him </s>
<s> 

mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay </s>
<s>   they were in
milsom street </s>
<s>   it began to rain not much but enough to make shelter
desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for
miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady
dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance </s>
<s>  she
anne and mrs clay therefore turned into mollands while mr elliot
stepped to lady dalrymple to request her assistance </s>
<s>   he soon joined
them again successful of course </s>
<s>  lady dalrymple would be most happy
to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes </s>
<s> 

her ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four
with any comfort </s>
<s>   miss carteret was with her mother </s>
<s>  consequently it
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden
place ladies </s>
<s>   there could be no doubt as to miss elliot </s>
<s>   whoever
suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied a little
time to settle the point of civility between the other two </s>
<s>   the rain
was a mere trifle and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with
mr elliot </s>
<s>   but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay </s>
<s>  she would
hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick </s>
<s>  much
thicker than miss annes </s>
<s>  and in short her civility rendered her
quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them </s>
<s>  miss
elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr
elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin annes boots were rather the
thickest </s>
<s> 

it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party in the
carriage </s>
<s>  and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat
near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain
wentworth walking down the street </s>
<s> 

her start was perceptible only to herself </s>
<s>  but she instantly felt that
she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and
absurd </s>
<s>   for a few minutes she saw nothing before her </s>
<s>  it was all
confusion </s>
<s>   she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she
found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always
obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs
clays </s>
<s> 

she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door </s>
<s>  she wanted to
see if it rained </s>
<s>   why was she to suspect herself of another motive </s>
<s> 
captain wentworth must be out of sight </s>
<s>   she left her seat she would
go </s>
<s>  one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other
half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was </s>
<s>   she
would see if it rained </s>
<s>   she was sent back however in a moment by the
entrance of captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and
ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a
little below milsom street </s>
<s>   he was more obviously struck and confused
by the sight of her than she had ever observed before </s>
<s>  he looked quite
red </s>
<s>   for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt
that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two </s>
<s>   she had the
advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments </s>
<s>   all the
overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise
were over with her </s>
<s>   still however she had enough to feel </s>
<s>   it was
agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery </s>
<s> 

he spoke to her and then turned away </s>
<s>   the character of his manner was
embarrassment </s>
<s>   she could not have called it either cold or friendly
or anything so certainly as embarrassed </s>
<s> 

after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again </s>
<s> 
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed </s>
<s>   neither of them probably
much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible
of his being less at ease than formerly </s>
<s>   they had by dint of being so
very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness </s>
<s>  but he could not do it
now </s>
<s>   time had changed him or louisa had changed him </s>
<s>   there was
consciousness of some sort or other </s>
<s>   he looked very well not as if he
had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross
of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of
his own arch significance as he named her </s>
<s>  but yet it was captain
wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was </s>
<s> 

it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth
would not know him </s>
<s>   she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw
him that there was complete internal recognition on each side </s>
<s>  she was
convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance
expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with
unalterable coldness </s>
<s> 

lady dalrymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing very
impatient now drew up </s>
<s>  the servant came in to announce it </s>
<s>   it was
beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a
bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop
understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot </s>
<s>   at
last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant for
there was no cousin returned were walking off </s>
<s>  and captain wentworth
watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words
was offering his services to her </s>
<s> 

i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with
them </s>
<s>   the carriage would not accommodate so many </s>
<s>   i walk </s>
<s>   i prefer
walking </s>
<s> 

but it rains </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  very little  nothing that i regard </s>
<s> 

after a moments pause he said </s>
<s>   though i came only yesterday i have
equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new
umbrella </s>
<s>  i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to
walk </s>
<s>  though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a
chair </s>
<s> 

she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating her
conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding
i am only waiting for mr elliot </s>
<s>   he will be here in a moment i am
sure </s>
<s> 

she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in </s>
<s>   captain
wentworth recollected him perfectly </s>
<s>   there was no difference between
him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme admiring anne as
she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged
relation and friend </s>
<s>   he came in with eagerness appeared to see and
think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept
her waiting and anxious to get her away without further loss of time
and before the rain increased </s>
<s>  and in another moment they walked off
together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a
good morning to you </s>
<s>  being all that she had time for as she passed
away </s>
<s> 

as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworths
party began talking of them </s>
<s> 

mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no that is clear enough </s>
<s>   one can guess what will happen there </s>
<s> 
he is always with them </s>
<s>  half lives in the family i believe </s>
<s>   what a
very goodlooking man </s>
<s> 

yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises says
he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with </s>
<s> 

she is pretty i think </s>
<s>  anne elliot </s>
<s>  very pretty when one comes to
look at her </s>
<s>   it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire
her more than her sister </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  so do i </s>
<s> 

and so do i </s>
<s>   no comparison </s>
<s>   but the men are all wild after miss
elliot </s>
<s>   anne is too delicate for them </s>
<s> 

anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would
have walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a
word </s>
<s>   she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though
nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting </s>
<s>  praise
warm just and discriminating of lady russell and insinuations
highly rational against mrs clay </s>
<s>   but just now she could think only of
captain wentworth </s>
<s>   she could not understand his present feelings
whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not </s>
<s>  and
till that point were settled she could not be quite herself </s>
<s> 

she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  alas </s>
<s>   she must
confess to herself that she was not wise yet </s>
<s> 

another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long he
meant to be in bath </s>
<s>  he had not mentioned it or she could not
recollect it </s>
<s>   he might be only passing through </s>
<s>   but it was more
probable that he should be come to stay </s>
<s>   in that case so liable as
every body was to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all
likelihood see him somewhere </s>
<s>   would she recollect him </s>
<s>   how would it
all be </s>
<s> 

she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove
was to marry captain benwick </s>
<s>   it had cost her something to encounter
lady russells surprise </s>
<s>  and now if she were by any chance to be
thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge of
the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him </s>
<s> 

the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first
hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain </s>
<s>  but at
last in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on the
right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the
greater part of the street </s>
<s>   there were many other men about him many
groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him </s>
<s>   she
looked instinctively at lady russell </s>
<s>  but not from any mad idea of her
recognising him so soon as she did herself </s>
<s>   no it was not to be
supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly
opposite </s>
<s>   she looked at her however from time to time anxiously </s>
<s>  and
when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring
to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen
she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russells eyes being turned
exactly in the direction for himof her being in short intently
observing him </s>
<s>   she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination
he must possess over lady russells mind the difficulty it must be for
her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that
eight or nine years should have passed over him and in foreign climes
and in active service too without robbing him of one personal grace </s>
<s> 

at last lady russell drew back her head </s>
<s>   now how would she speak of
him </s>
<s> 

you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long </s>
<s>  but
i was looking after some windowcurtains which lady alicia and mrs
frankland were telling me of last night </s>
<s>   they described the
drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this side of the
way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung
of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have
been trying to find out which it could be </s>
<s>  but i confess i can see no
curtains hereabouts that answer their description </s>
<s> 

anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her
friend or herself </s>
<s>   the part which provoked her most was that in all
this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right
moment for seeing whether he saw them </s>
<s> 

a day or two passed without producing anything </s>
<s>   the theatre or the
rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for
the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant
stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more
engaged </s>
<s>  and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of
knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was
not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening </s>
<s>   it was a
concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple </s>
<s>   of
course they must attend </s>
<s>   it was really expected to be a good one and
captain wentworth was very fond of music </s>
<s>   if she could only have a few
minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be
satisfied </s>
<s>  and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred </s>
<s>   elizabeth had turned from him
lady russell overlooked him </s>
<s>  her nerves were strengthened by these
circumstances </s>
<s>  she felt that she owed him attention </s>
<s> 

she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her </s>
<s> 
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off with
the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow </s>
<s>   mrs smith
gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence </s>
<s> 

by all means said she </s>
<s>  only tell me all about it when you do come </s>
<s> 
who is your party </s>
<s> 

anne named them all </s>
<s>   mrs smith made no reply </s>
<s>  but when she was leaving
her said and with an expression half serious half arch well i
heartily wish your concert may answer </s>
<s>  and do not fail me tomorrow if
you can come </s>
<s>  for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many
more visits from you </s>
<s> 

anne was startled and confused </s>
<s>  but after standing in a moments
suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away </s>
<s> 



chapter 


sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest of all
their party at the rooms in the evening </s>
<s>  and as lady dalrymple must be
waited for they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon
room </s>
<s>   but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and
captain wentworth walked in alone </s>
<s>   anne was the nearest to him and
making yet a little advance she instantly spoke </s>
<s>   he was preparing
only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do </s>
<s>  brought him
out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries in
return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back
ground </s>
<s>   their being in the back ground was a support to anne </s>
<s>  she knew
nothing of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed
right to be done </s>
<s> 

while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth
caught her ear </s>
<s>   she could not distinguish but she must guess the
subject </s>
<s>  and on captain wentworths making a distant bow she
comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time by a
side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself </s>
<s>   this
though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet better than
nothing and her spirits improved </s>
<s> 

after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert
their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last that
she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not </s>
<s>  he seemed in
no hurry to leave her </s>
<s>  and presently with renewed spirit with a little
smile a little glow he said

i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme </s>
<s>   i am afraid you must
have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering
you at the time </s>
<s> 

she assured him that she had not </s>
<s> 

it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day </s>
<s>  and he passed
his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still too painful
but in a moment half smiling again added the day has produced some
effects however </s>
<s>  has had some consequences which must be considered as
the very reverse of frightful </s>
<s>   when you had the presence of mind to
suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon
you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most
concerned in her recovery </s>
<s> 

certainly i could have none </s>
<s>   but it appearsi should hope it would
be a very happy match </s>
<s>   there are on both sides good principles and
good temper </s>
<s> 

yes said he looking not exactly forward </s>
<s>  but there i think ends
the resemblance </s>
<s>   with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over
every circumstance in favour of it </s>
<s>   they have no difficulties to
contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays </s>
<s>   the
musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters
comfort </s>
<s>   all this is much very much in favour of their happiness </s>
<s> 
more than perhaps

he stopped </s>
<s>   a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him
some taste of that emotion which was reddening annes cheeks and fixing
her eyes on the ground </s>
<s>   after clearing his throat however he
proceeded thus

i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity
and in a point no less essential than mind </s>
<s>   i regard louisa musgrove
as a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in
understanding but benwick is something more </s>
<s>   he is a clever man a
reading man </s>
<s>  and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to
her with some surprise </s>
<s>   had it been the effect of gratitude had he
learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it
would have been another thing </s>
<s>   but i have no reason to suppose it so </s>
<s> 
it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous
untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me </s>
<s>   a man like him
in his situation </s>
<s>  with a heart pierced wounded almost broken </s>
<s>   fanny
harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was
indeed attachment </s>
<s>   a man does not recover from such a devotion of the
heart to such a woman </s>
<s>   he ought not </s>
<s>  he does not </s>
<s> 

either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered
or from other consciousness he went no farther </s>
<s>  and anne who in spite
of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in
spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless slam
of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had
distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and
beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a
moment </s>
<s>   it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject </s>
<s>  and yet
after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the
smallest wish for a total change she only deviated so far as to say

you were a good while at lyme i think </s>
<s> 

about a fortnight </s>
<s>   i could not leave it till louisas doing well was
quite ascertained </s>
<s>   i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to
be soon at peace </s>
<s>   it had been my doing solely mine </s>
<s>   she would not
have been obstinate if i had not been weak </s>
<s>   the country round lyme is
very fine </s>
<s>   i walked and rode a great deal </s>
<s>  and the more i saw the
more i found to admire </s>
<s> 

i should very much like to see lyme again said anne </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>   i should not have supposed that you could have found anything
in lyme to inspire such a feeling </s>
<s>   the horror and distress you were
involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits </s>
<s>   i should have
thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust </s>
<s> 

the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne </s>
<s>  but when
pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure </s>
<s>   one does
not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been
all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at
lyme </s>
<s>   we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours
and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment </s>
<s>   so much
novelty and beauty </s>
<s>  i have travelled so little that every fresh place
would be interesting to me </s>
<s>  but there is real beauty at lyme </s>
<s>  and in
short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my
impressions of the place are very agreeable </s>
<s> 

as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party
appeared for whom they were waiting </s>
<s>   lady dalrymple lady dalrymple
was the rejoicing sound </s>
<s>  and with all the eagerness compatible with
anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet
her </s>
<s>   lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot and
colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant
advanced into the room </s>
<s>   the others joined them and it was a group in
which anne found herself also necessarily included </s>
<s>   she was divided
from captain wentworth </s>
<s>   their interesting almost too interesting
conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance
compared with the happiness which brought it on </s>
<s>   she had learnt in
the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all
his feelings than she dared to think of </s>
<s>  and she gave herself up to the
demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with
exquisite though agitated sensations </s>
<s>   she was in good humour with
all </s>
<s>   she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and
kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself </s>
<s> 

the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back
from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that
he was gone </s>
<s>   she was just in time to see him turn into the concert
room </s>
<s>   he was gone </s>
<s>  he had disappeared she felt a moments regret </s>
<s> 
but they should meet again </s>
<s>   he would look for her he would find her
out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as
well to be asunder </s>
<s>   she was in need of a little interval for
recollection </s>
<s> 

upon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party was
collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves and proceed
into the concert room </s>
<s>  and be of all the consequence in their power
draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people
as they could </s>
<s> 

very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in </s>
<s> 
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back
of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish
for which did not seem within her reach </s>
<s>  and annebut it would be an
insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison between
it and her sisters </s>
<s>  the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other
all generous attachment </s>
<s> 

anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room </s>
<s>   her
happiness was from within </s>
<s>   her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed </s>
<s> 
but she knew nothing about it </s>
<s>   she was thinking only of the last half
hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took a hasty range
over it </s>
<s>   his choice of subjects his expressions and still more his
manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light </s>
<s>   his
opinion of louisa musgroves inferiority an opinion which he had
seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings
as to a first strong attachment </s>
<s>  sentences begun which he could not
finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance
all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least </s>
<s>  that
anger resentment avoidance were no more </s>
<s>  and that they were
succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness
of the past </s>
<s>   yes some share of the tenderness of the past </s>
<s>   she could
not contemplate the change as implying less </s>
<s>   he must love her </s>
<s> 

these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and
flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation </s>
<s>  and she
passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even
trying to discern him </s>
<s>   when their places were determined on and they
were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen
to be in the same part of the room but he was not </s>
<s>  her eye could not
reach him </s>
<s>  and the concert being just opening she must consent for a
time to be happy in a humbler way </s>
<s> 

the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches </s>
<s>  anne
was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well
with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by
her </s>
<s>   miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object
of colonel walliss gallantry was quite contented </s>
<s> 

annes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the
evening </s>
<s>  it was just occupation enough </s>
<s>   she had feelings for the
tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience
for the wearisome </s>
<s>  and had never liked a concert better at least
during the first act </s>
<s>   towards the close of it in the interval
succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr
elliot </s>
<s>   they had a concert bill between them </s>
<s> 

this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the
words for certainly the sense of an italian lovesong must not be
talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give </s>
<s>  for i do not
pretend to understand the language </s>
<s>   i am a very poor italian scholar </s>
<s> 

yes yes i see you are </s>
<s>   i see you know nothing of the matter </s>
<s>   you
have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these
inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear
comprehensible elegant english </s>
<s>   you need not say anything more of
your ignorance </s>
<s>   here is complete proof </s>
<s> 

i will not oppose such kind politeness </s>
<s>  but i should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient </s>
<s> 

i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long
replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot </s>
<s>  and i do
regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be
aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for
modesty to be natural in any other woman </s>
<s> 

for shame </s>
<s>  for shame </s>
<s>  this is too much flattery </s>
<s>   i forget what we are
to have next turning to the bill </s>
<s> 

perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer
acquaintance with your character than you are aware of </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>   how so </s>
<s>   you can have been acquainted with it only since i
came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my
own family </s>
<s> 

i knew you by report long before you came to bath </s>
<s>   i had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately </s>
<s>   i have been acquainted
with you by character many years </s>
<s>   your person your disposition
accomplishments manner </s>
<s>  they were all present to me </s>
<s> 

mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise </s>
<s>   no
one can withstand the charm of such a mystery </s>
<s>   to have been described
long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible </s>
<s> 
and anne was all curiosity </s>
<s>   she wondered and questioned him eagerly </s>
<s> 
but in vain </s>
<s>   he delighted in being asked but he would not tell </s>
<s> 

no no some time or other perhaps but not now </s>
<s>   he would mention no
names now </s>
<s>  but such he could assure her had been the fact </s>
<s>   he had
many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had
inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the
warmest curiosity to know her </s>
<s> 

anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of
her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworths
brother </s>
<s>   he might have been in mr elliots company but she had not
courage to ask the question </s>
<s> 

the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound
to me </s>
<s>   very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy </s>
<s>  and if i
dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change </s>
<s> 

such she believed were his words </s>
<s>  but scarcely had she received their
sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind
her which rendered every thing else trivial </s>
<s>   her father and lady
dalrymple were speaking </s>
<s> 

a welllooking man said sir walter a very welllooking man </s>
<s> 

a very fine young man indeed </s>
<s>  said lady dalrymple </s>
<s>   more air than
one often sees in bath </s>
<s>   irish i dare say </s>
<s> 

no i just know his name </s>
<s>   a bowing acquaintance </s>
<s>   wentworth </s>
<s>  captain
wentworth of the navy </s>
<s>   his sister married my tenant in somersetshire
the croft who rents kellynch </s>
<s> 

before sir walter had reached this point annes eyes had caught the
right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a
cluster of men at a little distance </s>
<s>   as her eyes fell on him his
seemed to be withdrawn from her </s>
<s>   it had that appearance </s>
<s>   it seemed as
if she had been one moment too late </s>
<s>  and as long as she dared observe
he did not look again </s>
<s>   but the performance was recommencing and she
was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look
straight forward </s>
<s> 

when she could give another glance he had moved away </s>
<s>   he could not
have come nearer to her if he would </s>
<s>  she was so surrounded and shut in </s>
<s> 
but she would rather have caught his eye </s>
<s> 

mr elliots speech too distressed her </s>
<s>   she had no longer any
inclination to talk to him </s>
<s>   she wished him not so near her </s>
<s> 

the first act was over </s>
<s>   now she hoped for some beneficial change </s>
<s>  and
after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them did
decide on going in quest of tea </s>
<s>   anne was one of the few who did not
choose to move </s>
<s>   she remained in her seat and so did lady russell </s>
<s>  but
she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot </s>
<s>  and she did not mean
whatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from
conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity </s>
<s> 
she was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him </s>
<s> 

he did not come however </s>
<s>   anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a
distance but he never came </s>
<s>   the anxious interval wore away
unproductively </s>
<s>   the others returned the room filled again benches
were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of
penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or
the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed </s>
<s>   to anne it
chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation </s>
<s>   she could not quit
that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without
the interchange of one friendly look </s>
<s> 

in resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of
which was favourable for her </s>
<s>   colonel wallis declined sitting down
again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a
manner not to be refused to sit between them </s>
<s>  and by some other
removals and a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place
herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much
more within reach of a passerby </s>
<s>   she could not do so without
comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles </s>
<s>  but
still she did it and not with much happier effect </s>
<s>  though by what
seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next
neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the
concert closed </s>
<s> 

such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain
wentworth was again in sight </s>
<s>   she saw him not far off </s>
<s>   he saw her
too </s>
<s>  yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow
degrees came at last near enough to speak to her </s>
<s>   she felt that
something must be the matter </s>
<s>   the change was indubitable </s>
<s>   the
difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon
room was strikingly great </s>
<s>   why was it </s>
<s>   she thought of her father of
lady russell </s>
<s>   could there have been any unpleasant glances </s>
<s>   he began
by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of
uppercross </s>
<s>  owned himself disappointed had expected singing </s>
<s>  and in
short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over </s>
<s>   anne
replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in
allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance
improved and he replied again with almost a smile </s>
<s>   they talked for a
few minutes more </s>
<s>  the improvement held </s>
<s>  he even looked down towards the
bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying </s>
<s>  when at that
moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round </s>
<s>   it came
from mr elliot </s>
<s>   he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to
explain italian again </s>
<s>   miss carteret was very anxious to have a
general idea of what was next to be sung </s>
<s>   anne could not refuse </s>
<s>  but
never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit </s>
<s> 

a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed </s>
<s>  and
when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done
before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved
yet hurried sort of farewell </s>
<s>   he must wish her good night </s>
<s>  he was
going </s>
<s>  he should get home as fast as he could </s>
<s> 

is not this song worth staying for </s>
<s>  said anne suddenly struck by an
idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for </s>
<s> 
and he was gone directly </s>
<s> 

jealousy of mr elliot </s>
<s>   it was the only intelligible motive </s>
<s>   captain
wentworth jealous of her affection </s>
<s>   could she have believed it a week
ago </s>
<s>  three hours ago </s>
<s>   for a moment the gratification was exquisite </s>
<s> 
but alas </s>
<s>  there were very different thoughts to succeed </s>
<s>   how was such
jealousy to be quieted </s>
<s>   how was the truth to reach him </s>
<s>   how in all
the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he
ever learn of her real sentiments </s>
<s>   it was misery to think of mr
elliots attentions </s>

chapter 


anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to
mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when
mr elliot would be most likely to call </s>
<s>  for to avoid mr elliot was
almost a first object </s>
<s> 

she felt a great deal of goodwill towards him </s>
<s>   in spite of the
mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps
compassion </s>
<s>   she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he
seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own
sentiments by his early prepossession </s>
<s>   it was altogether very
extraordinary </s>
<s>  flattering but painful </s>
<s>   there was much to regret </s>
<s>   how
she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case
was not worth enquiry </s>
<s>  for there was a captain wentworth </s>
<s>  and be the
conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be
his for ever </s>
<s>   their union she believed could not divide her more
from other men than their final separation </s>
<s> 

prettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy could
never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting
with from camden place to westgate buildings </s>
<s>   it was almost enough to
spread purification and perfume all the way </s>
<s> 

she was sure of a pleasant reception </s>
<s>  and her friend seemed this
morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have
expected her though it had been an appointment </s>
<s> 

an account of the concert was immediately claimed </s>
<s>  and annes
recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her
features and make her rejoice to talk of it </s>
<s>   all that she could tell
she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been
there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had
already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne
could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the
company </s>
<s>   everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well
know by name to mrs smith </s>
<s> 

the little durands were there i conclude said she with their
mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be
fed </s>
<s>   they never miss a concert </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in
the room </s>
<s> 

the ibbotsons were they there </s>
<s>  and the two new beauties with the
tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>   i do not think they were </s>
<s> 

old lady mary maclean </s>
<s>   i need not ask after her </s>
<s>   she never misses i
know </s>
<s>  and you must have seen her </s>
<s>   she must have been in your own
circle </s>
<s>  for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of
grandeur round the orchestra of course </s>
<s> 

no that was what i dreaded </s>
<s>   it would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect </s>
<s>   but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be
farther off </s>
<s>  and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing </s>
<s> 
i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you saw enough for your own amusement </s>
<s>   i can understand </s>
<s>   there
is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this
you had </s>
<s>   you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing
beyond </s>
<s> 

but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while
she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that
the object only had been deficient </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  you were better employed </s>
<s>   you need not tell me that you had a
pleasant evening </s>
<s>   i see it in your eye </s>
<s>   i perfectly see how the hours
passed </s>
<s>   that you had always something agreeable to listen to </s>
<s>   in the
intervals of the concert it was conversation </s>
<s> 

anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye </s>
<s> 

yes i do </s>
<s>   your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in
company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in
the world the person who interests you at this present time more than
all the rest of the world put together </s>
<s> 

a blush overspread annes cheeks </s>
<s>   she could say nothing </s>
<s> 

and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i
hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to
me this morning </s>
<s>   it is really very good of you to come and sit with
me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time </s>
<s> 

anne heard nothing of this </s>
<s>   she was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine how
any report of captain wentworth could have reached her </s>
<s>   after another
short silence

pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with
me </s>
<s>   does he know that i am in bath </s>
<s> 

mr elliot </s>
<s>  repeated anne looking up surprised </s>
<s>   a moments
reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under </s>
<s>   she caught it
instantaneously </s>
<s>  and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety
soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot </s>
<s> 

i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith
gravely but it seems worn out now </s>
<s>   it is a great while since we met </s>
<s> 

i was not at all aware of this </s>
<s>   you never mentioned it before </s>
<s>   had i
known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you </s>
<s> 

to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of
cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have </s>
<s>   i want
you to talk about me to mr elliot </s>
<s>   i want your interest with him </s>
<s>   he
can be of essential service to me </s>
<s>  and if you would have the goodness
my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is
done </s>
<s> 

i should be extremely happy </s>
<s>  i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to
be of even the slightest use to you replied anne </s>
<s>  but i suspect that
you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater
right to influence him than is really the case </s>
<s>   i am sure you have
somehow or other imbibed such a notion </s>
<s>   you must consider me only as
mr elliots relation </s>
<s>   if in that light there is anything which you
suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not
hesitate to employ me </s>
<s> 

mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said

i have been a little premature i perceive </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon </s>
<s>   i
ought to have waited for official information </s>
<s>   but now my dear miss
elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak </s>
<s> 
next week </s>
<s>   to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all
settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliots good fortune </s>
<s> 

no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next </s>
<s>   i assure you
that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week </s>
<s> 
i am not going to marry mr elliot </s>
<s>   i should like to know why you
imagine i am </s>
<s> 

mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her
head and exclaimed

now how i do wish i understood you </s>
<s>   how i do wish i knew what you
were at </s>
<s>   i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when
the right moment occurs </s>
<s>   till it does come you know we women never
mean to have anybody </s>
<s>   it is a thing of course among us that every man
is refused till he offers </s>
<s>   but why should you be cruel </s>
<s>   let me plead
for mypresent friend i cannot call him but for my former friend </s>
<s> 
where can you look for a more suitable match </s>
<s>   where could you expect a
more gentlemanlike agreeable man </s>
<s>   let me recommend mr elliot </s>
<s>   i am
sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis </s>
<s>  and who can
know him better than colonel wallis </s>
<s> 

my dear mrs smith mr elliots wife has not been dead much above half
a year </s>
<s>   he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any
one </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr
elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him </s>
<s>   do
not forget me when you are married thats all </s>
<s>   let him know me to be
a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble
required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs
and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can </s>
<s>  very
natural perhaps </s>
<s>   ninetynine out of a hundred would do the same </s>
<s>   of
course he cannot be aware of the importance to me </s>
<s>   well my dear miss
elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy </s>
<s>   mr elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman </s>
<s>   your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been </s>
<s>   you are safe in all worldly matters and
safe in his character </s>
<s>   he will not be led astray </s>
<s>  he will not be
misled by others to his ruin </s>
<s> 

no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin </s>
<s>   he
seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous
impressions </s>
<s>   i consider him with great respect </s>
<s>   i have no reason
from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise </s>
<s> 
but i have not known him long </s>
<s>  and he is not a man i think to be
known intimately soon </s>
<s>   will not this manner of speaking of him mrs
smith convince you that he is nothing to me </s>
<s>   surely this must be calm
enough </s>
<s>   and upon my word he is nothing to me </s>
<s>   should he ever
propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any
thought of doing i shall not accept him </s>
<s>   i assure you i shall not </s>
<s> 
i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been
supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford </s>
<s> 
not mr elliot </s>
<s>  it is not mr elliot that

she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much </s>
<s> 
but less would hardly have been sufficient </s>
<s>   mrs smith would hardly
have believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception
of there being a somebody else </s>
<s>   as it was she instantly submitted
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond </s>
<s>  and anne eager to
escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have
fancied she was to marry mr elliot </s>
<s>  where she could have received the
idea or from whom she could have heard it </s>
<s> 

do tell me how it first came into your head </s>
<s> 

it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much
you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the
world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you </s>
<s>  and you
may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in
the same way </s>
<s>   but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago </s>
<s> 

and has it indeed been spoken of </s>
<s> 

did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called
yesterday </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid </s>
<s>   i observed no one
in particular </s>
<s> 

it was my friend mrs rooke </s>
<s>  nurse rooke </s>
<s>  who bythebye had a great
curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in </s>
<s> 
she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday </s>
<s>  and she it was
who told me you were to marry mr elliot </s>
<s>   she had had it from mrs
wallis herself which did not seem bad authority </s>
<s>   she sat an hour with
me on monday evening and gave me the whole history </s>
<s>  the whole
history repeated anne laughing </s>
<s>   she could not make a very long
history i think of one such little article of unfounded news </s>
<s> 

mrs smith said nothing </s>
<s> 

but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my
having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of
use to you in any way that i could </s>
<s>   shall i mention to him your being
in bath </s>
<s>   shall i take any message </s>
<s> 

no i thank you </s>
<s>   no certainly not </s>
<s>   in the warmth of the moment and
under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to
interest you in some circumstances </s>
<s>  but not now </s>
<s>   no i thank you i
have nothing to trouble you with </s>
<s> 

i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years </s>
<s> 

i did </s>
<s> 

not before he was married i suppose </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  he was not married when i knew him first </s>
<s> 

andwere you much acquainted </s>
<s> 

intimately </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>   then do tell me what he was at that time of life </s>
<s>   i have a
great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man </s>
<s>   was he
at all such as he appears now </s>
<s> 

i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther </s>
<s> 
and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity </s>
<s> 
they were both silent </s>
<s>   mrs smith very thoughtful </s>
<s>   at last

i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural
tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have
been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do </s>
<s>   i have
been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you </s>
<s>   there
were many things to be taken into the account </s>
<s>   one hates to be
officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief </s>
<s>   even the
smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving though there may
be nothing durable beneath </s>
<s>   however i have determined </s>
<s>  i think i am
right </s>
<s>  i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliots real
character </s>
<s>   though i fully believe that at present you have not the
smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may
happen </s>
<s>   you might some time or other be differently affected towards
him </s>
<s>   hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced </s>
<s>   mr
elliot is a man without heart or conscience </s>
<s>  a designing wary
coldblooded being who thinks only of himself </s>
<s>  whom for his own
interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery
that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character </s>
<s>   he
has no feeling for others </s>
<s>   those whom he has been the chief cause of
leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest
compunction </s>
<s>   he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of
justice or compassion </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  he is black at heart hollow and black </s>
<s> 

annes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and
in a calmer manner she added

my expressions startle you </s>
<s>   you must allow for an injured angry
woman </s>
<s>   but i will try to command myself </s>
<s>   i will not abuse him </s>
<s>   i
will only tell you what i have found him </s>
<s>   facts shall speak </s>
<s>   he was
the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and
thought him as good as himself </s>
<s>   the intimacy had been formed before
our marriage </s>
<s>   i found them most intimate friends </s>
<s>  and i too became
excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion
of him </s>
<s>   at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously </s>
<s>  but
mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more
agreeable than most others and we were almost always together </s>
<s>   we
were principally in town living in very good style </s>
<s>   he was then the
inferior in circumstances </s>
<s>  he was then the poor one </s>
<s>  he had chambers in
the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance
of a gentleman </s>
<s>   he had always a home with us whenever he chose it </s>
<s>  he
was always welcome </s>
<s>  he was like a brother </s>
<s>   my poor charles who had
the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his
last farthing with him </s>
<s>  and i know that his purse was open to him </s>
<s>  i
know that he often assisted him </s>
<s> 

this must have been about that very period of mr elliots life said
anne which has always excited my particular curiosity </s>
<s>   it must have
been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister </s>
<s> 
i never knew him myself </s>
<s>  i only heard of him </s>
<s>  but there was a something
in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and
afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could
quite reconcile with present times </s>
<s>   it seemed to announce a different
sort of man </s>
<s> 

i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith </s>
<s>   he had been
introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with
him but i heard him speak of them for ever </s>
<s>   i know he was invited and
encouraged and i know he did not choose to go </s>
<s>   i can satisfy you
perhaps on points which you would little expect </s>
<s>  and as to his
marriage i knew all about it at the time </s>
<s>   i was privy to all the fors
and againsts </s>
<s>  i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans </s>
<s> 
and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation
in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her
life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her
life and can answer any question you may wish to put </s>
<s> 

nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her </s>
<s>   i
have always understood they were not a happy couple </s>
<s>   but i should like
to know why at that time of his life he should slight my fathers
acquaintance as he did </s>
<s>   my father was certainly disposed to take very
kind and proper notice of him </s>
<s>   why did mr elliot draw back </s>
<s> 

mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one
object in view </s>
<s>   to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process
than the law </s>
<s>   he was determined to make it by marriage </s>
<s>   he was
determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage </s>
<s>  and i
know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot
decide that your father and sister in their civilities and
invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young
lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his
ideas of wealth and independence </s>
<s>   that was his motive for drawing
back i can assure you </s>
<s>   he told me the whole story </s>
<s>   he had no
concealments with me </s>
<s>   it was curious that having just left you behind
me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be
your cousin </s>
<s>  and that through him i should be continually hearing of
your father and sister </s>
<s>   he described one miss elliot and i thought
very affectionately of the other </s>
<s> 

perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of
me to mr elliot </s>
<s> 

to be sure i did </s>
<s>  very often </s>
<s>   i used to boast of my own anne elliot
and vouch for your being a very different creature from

she checked herself just in time </s>
<s> 

this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried
anne </s>
<s>   this explains it </s>
<s>   i found he had been used to hear of me </s>
<s>   i
could not comprehend how </s>
<s>   what wild imaginations one forms where dear
self is concerned </s>
<s>   how sure to be mistaken </s>
<s>   but i beg your pardon </s>
<s>  i
have interrupted you </s>
<s>   mr elliot married then completely for money </s>
<s> 
the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his
character </s>
<s> 

mrs smith hesitated a little here </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s>  those things are too common </s>
<s> 
when one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money is too
common to strike one as it ought </s>
<s>   i was very young and associated
only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any
strict rules of conduct </s>
<s>   we lived for enjoyment </s>
<s>   i think differently
now </s>
<s>  time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions </s>
<s>  but at
that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot
was doing </s>
<s>   to do the best for himself passed as a duty </s>
<s> 

but was not she a very low woman </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  which i objected to but he would not regard </s>
<s>   money money was
all that he wanted </s>
<s>   her father was a grazier her grandfather had been
a butcher but that was all nothing </s>
<s>   she was a fine woman had had a
decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance
into mr elliots company and fell in love with him </s>
<s>  and not a
difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her
birth </s>
<s>   all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount
of her fortune before he committed himself </s>
<s>   depend upon it whatever
esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young
man he had not the smallest value for it </s>
<s>   his chance for the kellynch
estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap
as dirt </s>
<s>   i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were
saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto
name and livery included </s>
<s>  but i will not pretend to repeat half that i
used to hear him say on that subject </s>
<s>   it would not be fair </s>
<s>  and yet
you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you
shall have proof </s>
<s> 

indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne </s>
<s>   you have
asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some
years ago </s>
<s>   this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to
hear and believe </s>
<s>   i am more curious to know why he should be so
different now </s>
<s> 

but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for
mary </s>
<s>  stay </s>
<s>   i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet </s>
<s> 

anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was
desired </s>
<s>   the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith
sighing over it as she unlocked it said

this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband </s>
<s>  a small
portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him </s>
<s>   the letter i
am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage
and happened to be saved </s>
<s>  why one can hardly imagine </s>
<s>   but he was
careless and immethodical like other men about those things </s>
<s>  and when
i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more
trivial from different people scattered here and there while many
letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed </s>
<s>   here it
is </s>
<s>  i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied
with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former
intimacy </s>
<s>   i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce
it </s>
<s> 

this was the letter directed to charles smith esq </s>
<s>  tunbridge wells
and dated from london as far back as july  </s>
<s> 

dear smithi have received yours </s>
<s>   your kindness almost overpowers
me </s>
<s>   i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i
have lived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like
it </s>
<s>   at present believe me i have no need of your services being in
cash again </s>
<s>   give me joy </s>
<s>   i have got rid of sir walter and miss </s>
<s>   they
are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this
summer </s>
<s>  but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell
me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer </s>
<s>   the baronet
nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again </s>
<s>  he is quite fool enough </s>
<s> 
if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent
equivalent  for the reversion </s>
<s>   he is worse than last year </s>
<s> 

i wish i had any name but elliot </s>
<s>   i am sick of it </s>
<s>   the name of
walter i can drop thank god </s>
<s>  and i desire you will never insult me
with my second w </s>
<s>  again meaning for the rest of my life to be only
yours trulywm </s>
<s>  elliot </s>
<s> 

such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow </s>
<s>  and mrs
smith observing the high colour in her face said

the language i know is highly disrespectful </s>
<s>   though i have forgot
the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning </s>
<s> 
but it shows you the man </s>
<s>   mark his professions to my poor husband </s>
<s> 
can any thing be stronger </s>
<s> 

anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of
finding such words applied to her father </s>
<s>   she was obliged to recollect
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that
no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no
private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could
recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been
meditating over and say

thank you </s>
<s>   this is full proof undoubtedly </s>
<s>  proof of every thing you
were saying </s>
<s>   but why be acquainted with us now </s>
<s> 

i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling </s>
<s> 

can you really </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>   i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i
will shew him as he is now </s>
<s>   i cannot produce written proof again but
i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is
now wanting and what he is now doing </s>
<s>   he is no hypocrite now </s>
<s>   he
truly wants to marry you </s>
<s>   his present attentions to your family are
very sincere </s>
<s>   quite from the heart </s>
<s>   i will give you my authority </s>
<s>  his
friend colonel wallis </s>
<s> 

colonel wallis </s>
<s>  you are acquainted with him </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>   it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that </s>
<s>  it
takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence </s>
<s>   the stream is as good
as at first </s>
<s>  the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily
moved away </s>
<s>   mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his
views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a
sensible careful discerning sort of character </s>
<s>  but colonel wallis has
a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better
not and he repeats it all to her </s>
<s>   she in the overflowing spirits of
her recovery repeats it all to her nurse </s>
<s>  and the nurse  knowing my
acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me </s>
<s>   on monday
evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of
marlborough buildings </s>
<s>   when i talked of a whole history therefore
you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed </s>
<s> 

my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient </s>
<s>   this will not do </s>
<s>   mr
elliots having any views on me will not in the least account for the
efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father </s>
<s>   that was all
prior to my coming to bath </s>
<s>   i found them on the most friendly terms
when i arrived </s>
<s> 

i know you did </s>
<s>  i know it all perfectly but

indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such
a line </s>
<s>   facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so
many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can
hardly have much truth left </s>
<s> 

only give me a hearing </s>
<s>   you will soon be able to judge of the general
credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself
immediately contradict or confirm </s>
<s>   nobody supposes that you were his
first inducement </s>
<s>   he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and
admired you but without knowing it to be you </s>
<s>   so says my historian
at least </s>
<s>   is this true </s>
<s>   did he see you last summer or autumn
somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it
to be you </s>
<s> 

he certainly did </s>
<s>   so far it is very true </s>
<s>   at lyme </s>
<s>   i happened to be
at lyme </s>
<s> 

well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted </s>
<s>   he saw you then
at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet
with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that
moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there </s>
<s>   but
there was another and an earlier which i will now explain </s>
<s>   if there
is anything in my story which you know to be either false or
improbable stop me </s>
<s>   my account states that your sisters friend the
lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath
with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when
they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since </s>
<s> 
that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible
and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea
among sir walters acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and
as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to
the danger </s>
<s> 

here mrs smith paused a moment </s>
<s>  but anne had not a word to say and she
continued

this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family
long before you returned to it </s>
<s>  and colonel wallis had his eye upon
your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit
in camden place </s>
<s>  but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in
watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath
for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas
colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and
the reports beginning to prevail </s>
<s>   now you are to understand that time
had worked a very material change in mr elliots opinions as to the
value of a baronetcy </s>
<s>   upon all points of blood and connexion he is a
completely altered man </s>
<s>   having long had as much money as he could
spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has
been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is
heir to </s>
<s>   i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it
is now a confirmed feeling </s>
<s>   he cannot bear the idea of not being sir
william </s>
<s>   you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his
friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced </s>
<s> 
the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of
fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former
acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give
him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of
circumventing the lady if he found it material </s>
<s>   this was agreed upon
between the two friends as the only thing to be done </s>
<s>  and colonel
wallis was to assist in every way that he could </s>
<s>   he was to be
introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to
be introduced </s>
<s>   mr elliot came back accordingly </s>
<s>  and on application was
forgiven as you know and readmitted into the family </s>
<s>  and there it
was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added
another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay </s>
<s>   he omitted no
opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at
all hours </s>
<s>  but i need not be particular on this subject </s>
<s>   you can
imagine what an artful man would do </s>
<s>  and with this guide perhaps may
recollect what you have seen him do </s>
<s> 

yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what
i have known or could imagine </s>
<s>   there is always something offensive in
the details of cunning </s>
<s>   the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises
me </s>
<s>   i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr
elliot who would have difficulty in believing it </s>
<s>  but i have never
been satisfied </s>
<s>   i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct
than appeared </s>
<s>   i should like to know his present opinion as to the
probability of the event he has been in dread of </s>
<s>  whether he considers
the danger to be lessening or not </s>
<s> 

lessening i understand replied mrs smith </s>
<s>   he thinks mrs clay
afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to
proceed as she might do in his absence </s>
<s>   but since he must be absent
some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while
she holds her present influence </s>
<s>   mrs wallis has an amusing idea as
nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when
you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay </s>
<s>   a
scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts </s>
<s>  but my
sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it </s>
<s>   why to be sure
maam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else </s>
<s> 
and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a
very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match </s>
<s>   she must
be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know </s>
<s>  and since self
will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of
attending the next lady elliot through mrs walliss recommendation </s>
<s> 

i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little
thoughtfulness </s>
<s>   it will be more painful to me in some respects to be
in company with him but i shall know better what to do </s>
<s>   my line of
conduct will be more direct </s>
<s>   mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous
artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to
guide him than selfishness </s>
<s> 

but mr elliot was not done with </s>
<s>   mrs smith had been carried away from
her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own
family concerns how much had been originally implied against him </s>
<s>  but
her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints
and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify
the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very
unfeeling in his conduct towards her </s>
<s>  very deficient both in justice
and compassion </s>
<s> 

she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr
elliots marriage they had been as before always together and mr
elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune </s>
<s>   mrs
smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of
throwing any on her husband </s>
<s>  but anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance </s>
<s>   from
his wifes account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man
of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong
understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him
led by him and probably despised by him </s>
<s>   mr elliot raised by his
marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of
pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself
for with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man and
beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to
be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends
probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin </s>
<s>  and the smiths
accordingly had been ruined </s>
<s> 

the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of
it </s>
<s>   they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the
friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliots had better
not be tried </s>
<s>  but it was not till his death that the wretched state of
his affairs was fully known </s>
<s>   with a confidence in mr elliots regard
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had
appointed him the executor of his will </s>
<s>  but mr elliot would not act
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been
such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to
without corresponding indignation </s>
<s> 

anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent
applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern
resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold
civility the same hardhearted indifference to any of the evils it
might bring on her </s>
<s>   it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and
inhumanity </s>
<s>  and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime
could have been worse </s>
<s>   she had a great deal to listen to </s>
<s>  all the
particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon
distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were
dwelt on now with a natural indulgence </s>
<s>   anne could perfectly
comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to
wonder at the composure of her friends usual state of mind </s>
<s> 

there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of
particular irritation </s>
<s>   she had good reason to believe that some
property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many
years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own
incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures </s>
<s>  and this
property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively
rich </s>
<s>   but there was nobody to stir in it </s>
<s>   mr elliot would do nothing
and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal
exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by
her want of money </s>
<s>   she had no natural connexions to assist her even
with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance
of the law </s>
<s>   this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means </s>
<s> 
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little
trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be
even weakening her claims was hard to bear </s>
<s> 

it was on this point that she had hoped to engage annes good offices
with mr elliot </s>
<s>   she had previously in the anticipation of their
marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it </s>
<s>  but on
being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since
he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that
something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he
loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annes feelings
as far as the observances due to mr elliots character would allow
when annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
everything </s>
<s>  and while it took from her the newformed hope of
succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the
comfort of telling the whole story her own way </s>
<s> 

after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not
but express some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so
favourably in the beginning of their conversation </s>
<s>   she had seemed to
recommend and praise him </s>
<s> 

my dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done </s>
<s> 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have
made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he
had been your husband </s>
<s>   my heart bled for you as i talked of
happiness </s>
<s>  and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a
woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless </s>
<s>   he was very unkind to
his first wife </s>
<s>   they were wretched together </s>
<s>   but she was too ignorant
and giddy for respect and he had never loved her </s>
<s>   i was willing to
hope that you must fare better </s>
<s> 

anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having
been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the
misery which must have followed </s>
<s>   it was just possible that she might
have been persuaded by lady russell </s>
<s>   and under such a supposition
which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too
late </s>
<s> 

it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived </s>
<s> 
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference
which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that
anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative
to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved </s>
<s> 



chapter 


anne went home to think over all that she had heard </s>
<s>   in one point her
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot </s>
<s>   there was no
longer anything of tenderness due to him </s>
<s>   he stood as opposed to
captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness </s>
<s>  and the evil
of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have
done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed </s>
<s>   pity
for him was all over </s>
<s>   but this was the only point of relief </s>
<s>   in every
other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw
more to distrust and to apprehend </s>
<s>   she was concerned for the
disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling </s>
<s>  for the
mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and
had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to
avert any one of them </s>
<s>   she was most thankful for her own knowledge of
him </s>
<s>   she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not
slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed
springing from it </s>
<s>   mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one
else could have done </s>
<s>   could the knowledge have been extended through
her family </s>
<s>   but this was a vain idea </s>
<s>   she must talk to lady russell
tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event
with as much composure as possible </s>
<s>  and after all her greatest want of
composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be
opened to lady russell </s>
<s>  in that flow of anxieties and fears which must
be all to herself </s>
<s> 


she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped
seeing mr elliot </s>
<s>  that he had called and paid them a long morning
visit </s>
<s>  but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when
she heard that he was coming again in the evening </s>
<s> 

i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with
affected carelessness but he gave so many hints </s>
<s>  so mrs clay says at
least </s>
<s> 

indeed i do say it </s>
<s>   i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for
an invitation </s>
<s>   poor man </s>
<s>   i was really in pain for him </s>
<s>  for your
hardhearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to
be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints </s>
<s>   however when i found how
excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this
morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an
opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together </s>
<s>   they appear to so
much advantage in company with each other </s>
<s>   each behaving so
pleasantly </s>
<s>   mr elliot looking up with so much respect </s>
<s> 

quite delightful </s>
<s>  cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her
eyes towards anne </s>
<s>   exactly like father and son </s>
<s>   dear miss elliot
may i not say father and son </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i lay no embargo on any bodys words </s>
<s>   if you will have such
ideas </s>
<s>   but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions
being beyond those of other men </s>
<s> 

my dear miss elliot </s>
<s>  exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence </s>
<s> 

well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him </s>
<s>   i did
invite him you know </s>
<s>   i sent him away with smiles </s>
<s>   when i found he
was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day
tomorrow i had compassion on him </s>
<s> 

anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such
pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her
prime object </s>
<s>   it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight
of mr elliot </s>
<s>  and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look
and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting
herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done
otherwise </s>
<s> 

to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the
room </s>
<s>  and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her </s>
<s>   she had
been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but
now she saw insincerity in everything </s>
<s>   his attentive deference to her
father contrasted with his former language was odious </s>
<s>  and when she
thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear
the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his
artificial good sentiments </s>
<s> 

she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a
remonstrance on his side </s>
<s>   it was a great object to her to escape all
enquiry or eclat </s>
<s>  but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to
him as might be compatible with their relationship </s>
<s>  and to retrace as
quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually led along </s>
<s>   she was accordingly more guarded and more
cool than she had been the night before </s>
<s> 

he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could
have heard her formerly praised </s>
<s>  wanted very much to be gratified by
more solicitation </s>
<s>  but the charm was broken </s>
<s>  he found that the heat and
animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousins
vanity </s>
<s>  he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of
those attempts which he could hazard among the toocommanding claims of
the others </s>
<s>   he little surmised that it was a subject acting now
exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all
those parts of his conduct which were least excusable </s>
<s> 

she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of
bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the
greater part of two days </s>
<s>   he was invited again to camden place the
very evening of his return </s>
<s>  but from thursday to saturday evening his
absence was certain </s>
<s>   it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be
always before her </s>
<s>  but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their
party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort </s>
<s>   it
was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on
her father and elizabeth </s>
<s>  to consider the various sources of
mortification preparing for them </s>
<s>   mrs clays selfishness was not so
complicate nor so revolting as his </s>
<s>  and anne would have compounded for
the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliots
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it </s>
<s> 

on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and
accomplish the necessary communication </s>
<s>  and she would have gone
directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some
obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to
wait till she might be safe from such a companion </s>
<s>   she saw mrs clay
fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning
in rivers street </s>
<s> 

very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love </s>
<s>   oh </s>
<s> 
you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and
pretend i have read it through </s>
<s>   i really cannot be plaguing myself for
ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out </s>
<s> 
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications </s>
<s>   you need not
tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night </s>
<s>   i used
to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the
concert </s>
<s>   something so formal and arrangé in her air </s>
<s>   and she sits so
upright </s>
<s>   my best love of course </s>
<s> 

and mine added sir walter </s>
<s>   kindest regards </s>
<s>   and you may say that
i mean to call upon her soon </s>
<s>   make a civil message </s>
<s>  but i shall only
leave my card </s>
<s>   morning visits are never fair by women at her time of
life who make themselves up so little </s>
<s>   if she would only wear rouge
she would not be afraid of being seen </s>
<s>  but last time i called i
observed the blinds were let down immediately </s>
<s> 

while her father spoke there was a knock at the door </s>
<s>   who could it
be </s>
<s>   anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr
elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven
miles off </s>
<s>   after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of
approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered
into the room </s>
<s> 

surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance </s>
<s>  but anne
was really glad to see them </s>
<s>  and the others were not so sorry but that
they could put on a decent air of welcome </s>
<s>  and as soon as it became
clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any
views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were
able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well </s>
<s>   they
were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the
white hart </s>
<s>   so much was pretty soon understood </s>
<s>  but till sir walter
and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawingroom and
regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon
charless brain for a regular history of their coming or an
explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had
been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent
confusion as to whom their party consisted of </s>
<s> 

she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and
captain harville beside their two selves </s>
<s>   he gave her a very plain
intelligible account of the whole </s>
<s>  a narration in which she saw a great
deal of most characteristic proceeding </s>
<s>   the scheme had received its
first impulse by captain harvilles wanting to come to bath on
business </s>
<s>   he had begun to talk of it a week ago </s>
<s>  and by way of doing
something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him
and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an
advantage to her husband </s>
<s>  but mary could not bear to be left and had
made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything
seemed to be in suspense or at an end </s>
<s>   but then it had been taken up
by his father and mother </s>
<s>   his mother had some old friends in bath whom
she wanted to see </s>
<s>  it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to
come and buy weddingclothes for herself and her sister </s>
<s>  and in short
it ended in being his mothers party that everything might be
comfortable and easy to captain harville </s>
<s>  and he and mary were included
in it by way of general convenience </s>
<s>   they had arrived late the night
before </s>
<s>   mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with
mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross </s>
<s> 

annes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of </s>
<s>   she had imagined such
difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage
from being near at hand </s>
<s>  but she learned from charles that very
recently since marys last letter to herself charles hayter had
been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not
possibly claim it under many years </s>
<s>  and that on the strength of his
present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question the two families had consented to the
young peoples wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place
in a few months quite as soon as louisas </s>
<s>   and a very good living it
was charles added </s>
<s>   only fiveandtwenty miles from uppercross and
in a very fine country </s>
<s>  fine part of dorsetshire </s>
<s>   in the centre of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great
proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other </s>
<s>  and to two
of the three at least charles hayter might get a special
recommendation </s>
<s>   not that he will value it as he ought he observed
charles is too cool about sporting </s>
<s>  thats the worst of him </s>
<s> 

i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this
should happen </s>
<s>  and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well
and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of
one should not be dimming those of the otherthat they should be so
equal in their prosperity and comfort </s>
<s>   i hope your father and mother
are quite happy with regard to both </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>   my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were
richer but he has no other fault to find </s>
<s>   money you know coming
down with moneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable
operation and it streightens him as to many things </s>
<s>   however i do not
mean to say they have not a right to it </s>
<s>   it is very fit they should
have daughters shares </s>
<s>  and i am sure he has always been a very kind
liberal father to me </s>
<s>   mary does not above half like henriettas match </s>
<s> 
she never did you know </s>
<s>   but she does not do him justice nor think
enough about winthrop </s>
<s>   i cannot make her attend to the value of the
property </s>
<s>   it is a very fair match as times go </s>
<s>  and i have liked
charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now </s>
<s> 

such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne
should be happy in their childrens marriages </s>
<s>   they do everything to
confer happiness i am sure </s>
<s>   what a blessing to young people to be in
such hands </s>
<s>   your father and mother seem so totally free from all those
ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery
both in young and old </s>
<s>   i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered
now </s>
<s> 

he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do </s>
<s>  very much
recovered </s>
<s>  but she is altered </s>
<s>  there is no running or jumping about no
laughing or dancing </s>
<s>  it is quite different </s>
<s>   if one happens only to
shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young
dabchick in the water </s>
<s>  and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses
or whispering to her all day long </s>
<s> 

anne could not help laughing </s>
<s>   that cannot be much to your taste i
know said she </s>
<s>  but i do believe him to be an excellent young man </s>
<s> 

to be sure he is </s>
<s>   nobody doubts it </s>
<s>  and i hope you do not think i am
so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself </s>
<s>   i have a great value for benwick </s>
<s>  and when one
can but get him to talk he has plenty to say </s>
<s>   his reading has done
him no harm for he has fought as well as read </s>
<s>   he is a brave fellow </s>
<s> 
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before </s>
<s>   we
had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in my fathers great
barns </s>
<s>  and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better
ever since </s>
<s> 

here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless
following the others to admire mirrors and china </s>
<s>  but anne had heard
enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in
its happiness </s>
<s>  and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none
of the illwill of envy in it </s>
<s>   she would certainly have risen to their
blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs </s>
<s> 

the visit passed off altogether in high good humour </s>
<s>   mary was in
excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well
satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage with four
horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that
she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and
enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they
were detailed to her </s>
<s>   she had no demands on her father or sister and
her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawingrooms </s>
<s> 

elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal </s>
<s>   she felt that
mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them </s>
<s>  but
she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of
servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been
always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch </s>
<s>   it was a struggle
between propriety and vanity </s>
<s>  but vanity got the better and then
elizabeth was happy again </s>
<s>   these were her internal persuasions </s>
<s>  old
fashioned notions </s>
<s>  country hospitality </s>
<s>  we do not profess to give
dinners </s>
<s>  few people in bath do </s>
<s>  lady alicia never does </s>
<s>  did not even
ask her own sisters family though they were here a month </s>
<s>  and i dare
say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove </s>
<s>  put her quite out of
her way </s>
<s>   i am sure she would rather not come </s>
<s>  she cannot feel easy
with us </s>
<s>   i will ask them all for an evening </s>
<s>  that will be much better </s>
<s> 
that will be a novelty and a treat </s>
<s>   they have not seen two such
drawing rooms before </s>
<s>   they will be delighted to come tomorrow
evening </s>
<s>   it shall be a regular party small but most elegant </s>
<s>   and
this satisfied elizabeth </s>
<s>   and when the invitation was given to the two
present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied </s>
<s> 
she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady
dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to
come </s>
<s>  and she could not have received a more gratifying attention </s>
<s> 
miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the
course of the morning </s>
<s>  and anne walked off with charles and mary to go
and see her and henrietta directly </s>
<s> 

her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present </s>
<s> 
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes </s>
<s>  but
anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to
see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an
eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form </s>
<s> 

they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and
anne had the kindest welcome from each </s>
<s>   henrietta was exactly in that
state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness which made
her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before
at all </s>
<s>  and mrs musgroves real affection had been won by her
usefulness when they were in distress </s>
<s>   it was a heartiness and a
warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad
want of such blessings at home </s>
<s>   she was entreated to give them as much
of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or
rather claimed as part of the family </s>
<s>  and in return she naturally
fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on
charless leaving them together was listening to mrs musgroves
history of louisa and to henriettas of herself giving opinions on
business and recommendations to shops </s>
<s>  with intervals of every help
which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts </s>
<s> 
from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to
convince her that she was not illused by anybody </s>
<s>  which mary well
amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the
entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining </s>
<s> 

a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected </s>
<s>   a large party in
an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene </s>
<s>   one five minutes
brought a note the next a parcel </s>
<s>  and anne had not been there half an
hour when their diningroom spacious as it was seemed more than half
filled </s>
<s>   a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove
and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth </s>
<s>   the
appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the
moment </s>
<s>   it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this
arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together
again </s>
<s>   their last meeting had been most important in opening his
feelings </s>
<s>  she had derived from it a delightful conviction </s>
<s>  but she
feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had
hastened him away from the concert room still governed </s>
<s>   he did not
seem to want to be near enough for conversation </s>
<s> 

she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried
to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence </s>
<s> surely if
there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand
each other ere long </s>
<s>   we are not boy and girl to be captiously
irritable misled by every moments inadvertence and wantonly playing
with our own happiness </s>
<s>   and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt
as if their being in company with each other under their present
circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and
misconstructions of the most mischievous kind </s>
<s> 

anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure
standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her </s>
<s>   i saw them
turn the corner from bath street just now </s>
<s>   they seemed deep in talk </s>
<s> 
who is it </s>
<s>   come and tell me </s>
<s>   good heavens </s>
<s>  i recollect </s>
<s>   it is mr
elliot himself </s>
<s> 

no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you </s>
<s>   he
was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the
consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret
that she had said so much simple as it was </s>
<s> 

mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin
began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting
still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to
come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to
be cool and unconcerned </s>
<s>   her distress returned however on perceiving
smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady
visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret </s>
<s>   it was
evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause
succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther </s>
<s> 

do come anne cried mary come and look yourself </s>
<s>   you will be too
late if you do not make haste </s>
<s>   they are parting </s>
<s>  they are shaking
hands </s>
<s>   he is turning away </s>
<s>   not know mr elliot indeed </s>
<s>   you seem to
have forgot all about lyme </s>
<s> 

to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move
quietly to the window </s>
<s>   she was just in time to ascertain that it
really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he
disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other </s>
<s> 
and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an
appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally
opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly </s>
<s> 
he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be
mistaken i might not attend </s>
<s>  and walked back to her chair
recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself
well </s>
<s> 

the visitors took their leave </s>
<s>  and charles having civilly seen them
off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began
with

well mother i have done something for you that you will like </s>
<s>   i
have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night </s>
<s>   ant
i a good boy </s>
<s>   i know you love a play </s>
<s>  and there is room for us all </s>
<s> 
it holds nine </s>
<s>   i have engaged captain wentworth </s>
<s>   anne will not be
sorry to join us i am sure </s>
<s>   we all like a play </s>
<s>   have not i done
well mother </s>
<s> 

mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect
readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when
mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming

good heavens charles </s>
<s>  how can you think of such a thing </s>
<s>   take a box
for tomorrow night </s>
<s>   have you forgot that we are engaged to camden
place tomorrow night </s>
<s>  and that we were most particularly asked to meet
lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal
family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them </s>
<s>   how can you be
so forgetful </s>
<s> 

phoo </s>
<s>  phoo </s>
<s>  replied charles whats an evening party </s>
<s>   never worth
remembering </s>
<s>   your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he
had wanted to see us </s>
<s>   you may do as you like but i shall go to the
play </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you
promised to go </s>
<s> 

no i did not promise </s>
<s>   i only smirked and bowed and said the word
happy </s>
<s>   there was no promise </s>
<s> 

but you must go charles </s>
<s>   it would be unpardonable to fail </s>
<s>   we were
asked on purpose to be introduced </s>
<s>   there was always such a great
connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves </s>
<s>   nothing ever happened
on either side that was not announced immediately </s>
<s>   we are quite near
relations you know </s>
<s>  and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly
to be acquainted with </s>
<s>   every attention is due to mr elliot </s>
<s>   consider
my fathers heir </s>
<s>   the future representative of the family </s>
<s> 

dont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles </s>
<s>   i
am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising
sun </s>
<s>   if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it
scandalous to go for the sake of his heir </s>
<s>   what is mr elliot to me </s>
<s> 
the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain
wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul </s>
<s> 
and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to
herself </s>
<s> 

charles and mary still talked on in the same style </s>
<s>  he half serious
and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she
invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make
it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she
should not think herself very well used if they went to the play
without her </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove interposed </s>
<s> 

we had better put it off </s>
<s>   charles you had much better go back and
change the box for tuesday </s>
<s>   it would be a pity to be divided and we
should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers </s>
<s> 
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play
if miss anne could not be with us </s>
<s> 

anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness </s>
<s>  and quite as much so
for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying

if it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home
excepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment </s>
<s>   i
have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to
change it for a play and with you </s>
<s>   but it had better not be
attempted perhaps </s>
<s>   she had spoken it </s>
<s>  but she trembled when it was
done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to
try to observe their effect </s>
<s> 

it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day </s>
<s>  charles
only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting
that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace </s>
<s>  probably
for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a
station with less barefaced design by anne </s>
<s> 

you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening
parties of the place </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>   the usual character of them has nothing for me </s>
<s>   i am no
cardplayer </s>
<s> 

you were not formerly i know </s>
<s>   you did not use to like cards </s>
<s>  but
time makes many changes </s>
<s> 

i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she
hardly knew what misconstruction </s>
<s>   after waiting a few moments he said
and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period
indeed </s>
<s>   eight years and a half is a period </s>
<s> 

whether he would have proceeded farther was left to annes imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour </s>
<s>  for while still hearing the sounds he
had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to
make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her
companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in </s>
<s> 

they were obliged to move </s>
<s>   anne talked of being perfectly ready and
tried to look it </s>
<s>  but she felt that could henrietta have known the
regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing
to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for
her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity
her </s>
<s> 

their preparations however were stopped short </s>
<s>   alarming sounds were
heard </s>
<s>  other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir
walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill </s>
<s> 
anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms
of the same </s>
<s>   the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was
over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk
to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister </s>
<s>   how
mortifying to feel that it was so </s>
<s> 

her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular </s>
<s>   captain wentworth was
acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before </s>
<s> 
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once </s>
<s> 
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure </s>
<s>   the sequel
explained it </s>
<s>   after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper
nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all
the remaining dues of the musgroves </s>
<s>   tomorrow evening to meet a few
friends </s>
<s>   no formal party </s>
<s>  it was all said very gracefully and the
cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home
were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all
and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth </s>
<s>   the
truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his </s>
<s>   the past
was nothing </s>
<s>   the present was that captain wentworth would move about
well in her drawingroom </s>
<s>   the card was pointedly given and sir walter
and elizabeth arose and disappeared </s>
<s> 

the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not
to anne </s>
<s>   she could think only of the invitation she had with such
astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been
received </s>
<s>  a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than
gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance </s>
<s>   she
knew him </s>
<s>  she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe
that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for
all the insolence of the past </s>
<s>   her spirits sank </s>
<s>   he held the card in
his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it </s>
<s> 

only think of elizabeths including everybody </s>
<s>  whispered mary very
audibly </s>
<s>   i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted </s>
<s>   you see he
cannot put the card out of his hand </s>
<s> 

anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she
might neither see nor hear more to vex her </s>
<s> 

the party separated </s>
<s>   the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies
proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne
belonged to them </s>
<s>   she was earnestly begged to return and dine and
give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long
exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for
home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose </s>
<s> 

promising to be with them the whole of the following morning
therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to
camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the
busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrows party the
frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually
improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the
most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself
with the neverending question of whether captain wentworth would come
or not </s>
<s>   they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a
gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together </s>
<s>   she
generally thought he would come because she generally thought he
ought </s>
<s>  but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive
act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of
very opposite feelings </s>
<s> 

she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation
to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours
after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain
for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she
determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs
clays face as she listened </s>
<s>   it was transient </s>
<s>  cleared away in an
instant </s>
<s>  but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of
having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing
authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to
his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter </s>
<s>   she
exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear </s>
<s>  very true </s>
<s>   only think miss elliot to my great surprise i
met with mr elliot in bath street </s>
<s>   i was never more astonished </s>
<s>   he
turned back and walked with me to the pump yard </s>
<s>   he had been prevented
setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what </s>
<s>  for i was in a
hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being
determined not to be delayed in his return </s>
<s>   he wanted to know how
early he might be admitted tomorrow </s>
<s>   he was full of tomorrow and
it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i
entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that
had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of
my head </s>

chapter 


one day only had passed since annes conversation with mrs smith </s>
<s>  but a
keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr
elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became
a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory
visit in rivers street </s>
<s>   she had promised to be with the musgroves from
breakfast to dinner </s>
<s>   her faith was plighted and mr elliots
character like the sultaness scheherazades head must live another
day </s>

she could not keep her appointment punctually however </s>
<s>  the weather was
unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends
account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to
attempt the walk </s>
<s>   when she reached the white hart and made her way to
the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time
nor the first to arrive </s>
<s>   the party before her were mrs musgrove
talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth </s>
<s>  and
she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait
had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon
and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to
keep her there till they returned </s>
<s>   she had only to submit sit down
be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the
agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little
before the morning closed </s>
<s>   there was no delay no waste of time </s>
<s>   she
was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such
happiness instantly </s>
<s>   two minutes after her entering the room captain
wentworth said

we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you
will give me materials </s>
<s> 

materials were at hand on a separate table </s>
<s>  he went to it and nearly
turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing </s>
<s> 

mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughters
engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was
perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper </s>
<s>   anne felt that
she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville
seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing
many undesirable particulars </s>
<s>  such as how mr musgrove and my brother
hayter had met again and again to talk it over </s>
<s>  what my brother hayter
had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what
had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished
and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards
persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same
style of openhearted communication </s>
<s>   minutiae which even with every
advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not
give could be properly interesting only to the principals </s>
<s>   mrs croft
was attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all it
was very sensibly </s>
<s>   anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much
selfoccupied to hear </s>
<s> 

and so maam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her
powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet
altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for
charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near
as bad </s>
<s>  and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the
best of it as many others have done before them </s>
<s>   at any rate said i
it will be better than a long engagement </s>
<s> 

that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft </s>
<s>   i
would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and
have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in
a long engagement </s>
<s>   i always think that no mutual

oh </s>
<s>  dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her finish her
speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long
engagement </s>
<s>   it is what i always protested against for my children </s>
<s>   it
is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if
there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or
even in twelve </s>
<s>  but a long engagement

yes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an
engagement which may be long </s>
<s>   to begin without knowing that at such a
time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and
unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can </s>
<s> 

anne found an unexpected interest here </s>
<s>   she felt its application to
herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her </s>
<s>  and at the same
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table
captain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing
listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one
quick conscious look at her </s>
<s> 

the two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary
practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing
distinctly </s>
<s>  it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in
confusion </s>
<s> 

captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left
his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though
it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he
was inviting her to join him where he stood </s>
<s>   he looked at her with a
smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i
have something to say </s>
<s>  and the unaffected easy kindness of manner
which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was
strongly enforced the invitation </s>
<s>   she roused herself and went to him </s>
<s> 
the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from
where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain
wentworths table not very near </s>
<s>   as she joined him captain
harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful expression
which seemed its natural character </s>
<s> 

look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a
small miniature painting do you know who that is </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>   captain benwick </s>
<s> 

yes and you may guess who it is for </s>
<s>   but in a deep tone it was
not done for her </s>
<s>   miss elliot do you remember our walking together at
lyme and grieving for him </s>
<s>   i little thought thenbut no matter </s>
<s> 
this was drawn at the cape </s>
<s>   he met with a clever young german artist
at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to
him and was bringing it home for her </s>
<s>  and i have now the charge of
getting it properly set for another </s>
<s>   it was a commission to me </s>
<s>   but
who else was there to employ </s>
<s>   i hope i can allow for him </s>
<s>   i am not
sorry indeed to make it over to another </s>
<s>   he undertakes it </s>
<s>  looking
towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now </s>
<s>   and with a
quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny </s>
<s>  she would
not have forgotten him so soon </s>
<s> 

no replied anne in a low feeling voice </s>
<s>  that i can easily
believe </s>
<s> 

it was not in her nature </s>
<s>   she doted on him </s>
<s> 

it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved </s>
<s> 

captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your
sex </s>
<s>  and she answered the question smiling also yes </s>
<s>   we certainly
do not forget you as soon as you forget us </s>
<s>   it is perhaps our fate
rather than our merit </s>
<s>   we cannot help ourselves </s>
<s>   we live at home
quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us </s>
<s>   you are forced on
exertion </s>
<s>   you have always a profession pursuits business of some
sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and
continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions </s>
<s> 

granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to
benwick </s>
<s>   he has not been forced upon any exertion </s>
<s>   the peace turned
him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our
little family circle ever since </s>
<s> 

true said anne very true </s>
<s>  i did not recollect </s>
<s>  but what shall we
say now captain harville </s>
<s>   if the change be not from outward
circumstances it must be from within </s>
<s>  it must be nature mans nature
which has done the business for captain benwick </s>
<s> 

no no it is not mans nature </s>
<s>   i will not allow it to be more mans
nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love or
have loved </s>
<s>   i believe the reverse </s>
<s>   i believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental </s>
<s>  and that as our bodies are
the strongest so are our feelings </s>
<s>  capable of bearing most rough
usage and riding out the heaviest weather </s>
<s> 

your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same
spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most
tender </s>
<s>   man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived </s>
<s> 
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments </s>
<s> 
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise </s>
<s>   you have
difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with </s>
<s>   you
are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship </s>
<s> 
your home country friends all quitted </s>
<s>   neither time nor health
nor life to be called your own </s>
<s>   it would be hard indeed with a
faltering voice if womans feelings were to be added to all this </s>
<s> 

we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was
beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain
wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room </s>
<s>   it was
nothing more than that his pen had fallen down </s>
<s>  but anne was startled
at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to
suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by
them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could
have caught </s>
<s> 

have you finished your letter </s>
<s>  said captain harville </s>
<s> 

not quite a few lines more </s>
<s>   i shall have done in five minutes </s>
<s> 

there is no hurry on my side </s>
<s>   i am only ready whenever you are </s>
<s>   i am
in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and
want for nothing </s>
<s>   no hurry for a signal at all </s>
<s>   well miss elliot
lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose
upon this point </s>
<s>   no man and woman would probably </s>
<s>   but let me
observe that all histories are against youall stories prose and
verse </s>
<s>   if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty
quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i
ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon
womans inconstancy </s>
<s>   songs and proverbs all talk of womans
fickleness </s>
<s>   but perhaps you will say these were all written by men </s>
<s> 

perhaps i shall </s>
<s>   yes yes if you please no reference to examples in
books </s>
<s>   men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story </s>
<s> 
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree </s>
<s>  the pen has been
in their hands </s>
<s>   i will not allow books to prove anything </s>
<s> 

but how shall we prove anything </s>
<s> 

we never shall </s>
<s>   we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a
point </s>
<s>   it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof </s>
<s> 
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex </s>
<s>  and
upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has
occurred within our own circle </s>
<s>  many of which circumstances perhaps
those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as
cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some
respect saying what should not be said </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could
but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at
his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off
in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows
whether we ever meet again </s>
<s>  and then if i could convey to you the
glow of his soul when he does see them again </s>
<s>  when coming back after a
twelvemonths absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port
he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to
deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but
all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them
arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner
still </s>
<s>   if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear
and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his
existence </s>
<s>   i speak you know only of such men as have hearts </s>
<s> 
pressing his own with emotion </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by
you and by those who resemble you </s>
<s>   god forbid that i should
undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my
fellowcreatures </s>
<s>   i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to
suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman </s>
<s> 
no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married
lives </s>
<s>   i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every
domestic forbearance so long asif i may be allowed the
expressionso long as you have an object </s>
<s>   i mean while the woman you
love lives and lives for you </s>
<s>   all the privilege i claim for my own
sex it is not a very enviable one </s>
<s>  you need not covet it is that of
loving longest when existence or when hope is gone </s>
<s> 

she could not immediately have uttered another sentence </s>
<s>  her heart was
too full her breath too much oppressed </s>
<s> 

you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her
arm quite affectionately </s>
<s>   there is no quarrelling with you </s>
<s>   and
when i think of benwick my tongue is tied </s>
<s> 

their attention was called towards the others </s>
<s>   mrs croft was taking
leave </s>
<s> 

here frederick you and i part company i believe said she </s>
<s>   i am
going home and you have an engagement with your friend </s>
<s>   tonight we
may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to
anne </s>
<s>   we had your sisters card yesterday and i understood
frederick had a card too though i did not see it </s>
<s>  and you are
disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves </s>
<s> 

captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either
could not or would not answer fully </s>
<s> 

yes said he very true </s>
<s>  here we separate but harville and i shall
soon be after you </s>
<s>  that is harville if you are ready i am in half a
minute </s>
<s>   i know you will not be sorry to be off </s>
<s>   i shall be at your
service in half a minute </s>
<s> 

mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter
with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated
air which shewed impatience to be gone </s>
<s>   anne knew not how to
understand it </s>
<s>   she had the kindest good morning god bless you </s>
<s>  from
captain harville but from him not a word nor a look </s>
<s>   he had passed
out of the room without a look </s>
<s> 

she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had
been writing when footsteps were heard returning </s>
<s>  the door opened it
was himself </s>
<s>   he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves
and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a
letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes
of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his
gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware
of his being in it </s>
<s>  the work of an instant </s>
<s> 

the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond
expression </s>
<s>   the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a </s>
<s> 
e </s>
<s>  was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily </s>
<s> 
while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also
addressing her </s>
<s>   on the contents of that letter depended all which this
world could do for her </s>
<s>   anything was possible anything might be
defied rather than suspense </s>
<s>   mrs musgrove had little arrangements of
her own at her own table </s>
<s>  to their protection she must trust and
sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very
spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following
words </s>
<s> 


i can listen no longer in silence </s>
<s>   i must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach </s>
<s>   you pierce my soul </s>
<s>   i am half agony half
hope </s>
<s>   tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are
gone for ever </s>
<s>   i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your
own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago </s>
<s>   dare
not say that man forgets sooner than  woman that his love has an
earlier death </s>
<s>   i have loved none but you </s>
<s>   unjust i may have been
weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant </s>
<s>   you alone have
brought me to bath </s>
<s>   for you alone i think and plan </s>
<s>   have you not
seen this </s>
<s>   can you fail to have understood my wishes </s>
<s>   i had not
waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think
you must have penetrated mine </s>
<s>   i can hardly write </s>
<s>   i am every instant
hearing something which overpowers me </s>
<s>   you sink your voice but i can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others </s>
<s> 
too good too excellent creature </s>
<s>   you do us justice indeed </s>
<s>   you do
believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men </s>
<s>   believe
it to be most fervent most undeviating in f </s>
<s>  w </s>
<s> 

i must go uncertain of my fate </s>
<s>  but i shall return hither or follow
your party as soon as possible </s>
<s>   a word a look will be enough to
decide whether i enter your fathers house this evening or never </s>
<s> 


such a letter was not to be soon recovered from </s>
<s>   half an hours
solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her </s>
<s>  but the ten
minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the
restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity </s>
<s> 
every moment rather brought fresh agitation </s>
<s>   it was overpowering
happiness </s>
<s>   and before she was beyond the first stage of full
sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in </s>
<s> 

the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an
immediate struggle </s>
<s>  but after a while she could do no more </s>
<s>   she began
not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead
indisposition and excuse herself </s>
<s>   they could then see that she looked
very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her
for the world </s>
<s>   this was dreadful </s>
<s>   would they only have gone away and
left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her
cure </s>
<s>  but to have them all standing or waiting around her was
distracting and in desperation she said she would go home </s>
<s> 

by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and
take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening </s>
<s>   i wish
sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself </s>
<s>   charles ring
and order a chair </s>
<s>   she must not walk </s>
<s> 

but the chair would never do </s>
<s>   worse than all </s>
<s>   to lose the possibility
of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet
solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting
him could not be borne </s>
<s>   the chair was earnestly protested against
and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having
assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the
case </s>
<s>  that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow
on her head </s>
<s>  that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall </s>
<s> 
could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at
night </s>
<s> 

anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said

i am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood </s>
<s>   pray be so
good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your
whole party this evening </s>
<s>   i am afraid there had been some mistake </s>
<s>  and
i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain
wentworth that we hope to see them both </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear it is quite understood i give you my word </s>
<s>   captain
harville has no thought but of going </s>
<s> 

do you think so </s>
<s>   but i am afraid </s>
<s>  and i should be so very sorry </s>
<s> 
will you promise me to mention it when you see them again </s>
<s>   you will
see them both this morning i dare say </s>
<s>   do promise me </s>
<s> 

to be sure i will if you wish it </s>
<s>   charles if you see captain
harville anywhere remember to give miss annes message </s>
<s>   but indeed
my dear you need not be uneasy </s>
<s>   captain harville holds himself quite
engaged ill answer for it </s>
<s>  and captain wentworth the same i dare
say </s>
<s> 

anne could do no more </s>
<s>  but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp
the perfection of her felicity </s>
<s>   it could not be very lasting however </s>
<s> 
even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her
power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville </s>
<s>   another
momentary vexation occurred </s>
<s>   charles in his real concern and good
nature would go home with her </s>
<s>  there was no preventing him </s>
<s>   this was
almost cruel </s>
<s>   but she could not be long ungrateful </s>
<s>  he was sacrificing
an engagement at a gunsmiths to be of use to her </s>
<s>  and she set off
with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent </s>
<s> 

they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of
familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of
captain wentworth </s>
<s>   he joined them </s>
<s>  but as if irresolute whether to
join or to pass on said nothing only looked </s>
<s>   anne could command
herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively </s>
<s>   the cheeks
which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated
were decided </s>
<s>   he walked by her side </s>
<s>   presently struck by a sudden
thought charles said

captain wentworth which way are you going </s>
<s>   only to gay street or
farther up the town </s>
<s> 

i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised </s>
<s> 

are you going as high as belmont </s>
<s>   are you going near camden place </s>
<s> 
because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my
place and give anne your arm to her fathers door </s>
<s>   she is rather done
for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to
be at that fellows in the market place </s>
<s>   he promised me the sight of a
capital gun he is just going to send off </s>
<s>  said he would keep it
unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it </s>
<s>  and if i do
not turn back now i have no chance </s>
<s>   by his description a good deal
like the second size doublebarrel of mine which you shot with one day
round winthrop </s>
<s> 

there could not be an objection </s>
<s>   there could be only the most proper
alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view </s>
<s>  and smiles reined
in and spirits dancing in private rapture </s>
<s>   in half a minute charles
was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding
together </s>
<s>   and soon words enough had passed between them to decide
their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel
walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a
blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the
happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow </s>
<s>   there
they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once
before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so
many many years of division and estrangement </s>
<s>   there they returned
again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their
reunion than when it had been first projected </s>
<s>  more tender more
tried more fixed in a knowledge of each others character truth and
attachment </s>
<s>  more equal to act more justified in acting </s>
<s>   and there as
they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around
them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers
flirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those
explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which
were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest </s>
<s>   all the little
variations of the last week were gone through </s>
<s>  and of yesterday and
today there could scarcely be an end </s>
<s> 

she had not mistaken him </s>
<s>   jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding
weight the doubt the torment </s>
<s>   that had begun to operate in the very
hour of first meeting her in bath </s>
<s>  that had returned after a short
suspension to ruin the concert </s>
<s>  and that had influenced him in
everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last
fourandtwenty hours </s>
<s>   it had been gradually yielding to the better
hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged </s>
<s>  it
had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which
had reached him while she talked with captain harville </s>
<s>  and under the
irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and
poured out his feelings </s>
<s> 

of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified </s>
<s> 
he persisted in having loved none but her </s>
<s>   she had never been
supplanted </s>
<s>   he never even believed himself to see her equal </s>
<s>   thus
much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge </s>
<s>   that he had been constant
unconsciously nay unintentionally </s>
<s>  that he had meant to forget her
and believed it to be done </s>
<s>   he had imagined himself indifferent when
he had only been angry </s>
<s>  and he had been unjust to her merits because
he had been a sufferer from them </s>
<s>   her character was now fixed on his
mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of
fortitude and gentleness </s>
<s>  but he was obliged to acknowledge that only
at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he
begun to understand himself </s>
<s>   at lyme he had received lessons of more
than one sort </s>
<s>   the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused
him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harvilles had fixed her
superiority </s>
<s> 

in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the
attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to
be impossible </s>
<s>  that he had not cared could not care for louisa </s>
<s> 
though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed
it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which
louisas could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold
it possessed over his own </s>
<s>   there he had learnt to distinguish between
the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of selfwill between the
darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind </s>
<s>   there
he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had
lost </s>
<s>  and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of
resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in
his way </s>
<s> 

from that period his penance had become severe </s>
<s>   he had no sooner been
free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of
louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he
had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty </s>
<s> 

i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man </s>
<s> 
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual
attachment </s>
<s>   i was startled and shocked </s>
<s>   to a degree i could
contradict this instantly </s>
<s>  but when i began to reflect that others
might have felt the sameher own family nay perhaps herselfi was
no longer at my own disposal </s>
<s>   i was hers in honour if she wished it </s>
<s> 
i had been unguarded </s>
<s>   i had not thought seriously on this subject
before </s>
<s>   i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its
danger of ill consequence in many ways </s>
<s>  and that i had no right to be
trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the
risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill
effects </s>
<s>   i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences </s>
<s> 

he found too late in short that he had entangled himself </s>
<s>  and that
precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at
all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him
were what the harvilles supposed </s>
<s>   it determined him to leave lyme and
await her complete recovery elsewhere </s>
<s>   he would gladly weaken by any
fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might
exist </s>
<s>  and he went therefore to his brothers meaning after a while
to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require </s>
<s> 

i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy </s>
<s>   i could
have no other pleasure </s>
<s>   i deserved none </s>
<s>   he enquired after you very
particularly </s>
<s>  asked even if you were personally altered little
suspecting that to my eye you could never alter </s>
<s> 

anne smiled and let it pass </s>
<s>   it was too pleasing a blunder for a
reproach </s>
<s>   it is something for a woman to be assured in her
eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier
youth </s>
<s>  but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to
anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the
result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment </s>
<s> 

he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own
pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released
from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her
engagement with benwick </s>
<s> 

here said he ended the worst of my state </s>
<s>  for now i could at least
put myself in the way of happiness </s>
<s>  i could exert myself </s>
<s>  i could do
something </s>
<s>   but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for
evil had been dreadful </s>
<s>   within the first five minutes i said i will
be at bath on wednesday and i was </s>
<s>   was it unpardonable to think it
worth my while to come </s>
<s>  and to arrive with some degree of hope </s>
<s>   you
were single </s>
<s>   it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the
past as i did </s>

pretensions than myself </s>

their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the
concert still more </s>
<s>   that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite
moments </s>
<s>   the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to
speak to him </s>
<s>   the moment of mr elliots appearing and tearing her
away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or
increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy </s>

wellwishers </s>
<s>  to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match </s>

to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to
influence you </s>
<s>   even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his </s>
<s>   was it
not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared </s>
<s>   how could i look
on without agony </s>
<s>   was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her
influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had
once donewas it not all against me </s>
<s> 

you should have distinguished replied anne </s>
<s>   you should not have
suspected me now </s>
<s>  the case is so different and my age is so different </s>
<s> 
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to
persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk </s>
<s>   when i yielded
i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here </s>
<s>   in
marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred
and all duty violated </s>
<s> 

perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not </s>
<s> 
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of
your character </s>
<s>   i could not bring it into play </s>
<s>  it was overwhelmed
buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under
year after year </s>
<s>   i could think of you only as one who had yielded who
had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me </s>
<s> 
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of
misery </s>
<s>   i had no reason to believe her of less authority now </s>
<s>   the
force of habit was to be added </s>
<s> 

i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might
have spared you much or all of this </s>
<s> 

no no </s>
<s>  your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to
another man would give </s>
<s>   i left you in this belief </s>
<s>  and yet i was
determined to see you again </s>
<s>   my spirits rallied with the morning and
i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here </s>
<s> 

at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived </s>
<s>   all the surprise and suspense and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she
reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some
momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last </s>
<s>   an interval
of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of
everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity </s>
<s>  and she went to her
room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her
enjoyment </s>
<s> 

the evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company
assembled </s>
<s>   it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who
had never met before and those who met too often </s>
<s>  a commonplace
business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety </s>
<s>  but anne
had never found an evening shorter </s>
<s>   glowing and lovely in sensibility
and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or
cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature
around her </s>
<s>   mr elliot was there </s>

<s> 
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them </s>
<s>   lady dalrymple
and miss carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her </s>
<s>   she
cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public
manners of her father and sister </s>
<s>   with the musgroves there was the
happy chat of perfect ease </s>
<s>  with captain harville the kindhearted
intercourse of brother and sister </s>
<s>  with lady russell attempts at
conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short </s>
<s>  with admiral
and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest
which the same consciousness sought to conceal </s>
<s>  and with captain
wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and
always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there </s>
<s> 

it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in
admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said

i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of
the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself </s>
<s>  and i must believe
that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly
right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you
do now </s>
<s>   to me she was in the place of a parent </s>
<s>   do not mistake me
however </s>
<s>   i am not saying that she did not err in her advice </s>
<s>   it was
perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the
event decides </s>
<s>  and for myself i certainly never should in any
circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice </s>
<s>   but i mean
that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done
otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement
than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my
conscience </s>
<s>   i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in
human nature nothing to reproach myself with </s>
<s>  and if i mistake not a
strong sense of duty is no bad part of a womans portion </s>

he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her
replied as if in cool deliberation

not yet </s>
<s>   but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time </s>
<s>   i trust
to being in charity with her soon </s>

have been one person more my enemy even than that lady </s>
<s>   my own self </s>
<s> 
tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few
thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written
to you would you have answered my letter </s>

renewed the engagement then </s>

it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success </s>
<s>  but i
was proud too proud to ask again </s>
<s>   i did not understand you </s>
<s>   i shut
my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice </s>
<s>   this is a
recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than
myself </s>
<s>   six years of separation and suffering might have been spared </s>
<s> 
it is a sort of pain too which is new to me </s>
<s>   i have been used to the
gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i

chapter 


who can be in doubt of what followed </s>
<s>   when any two young people take
it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to
carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever
so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort </s>
<s> 
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be
truth </s>
<s>  and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and
an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness
of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing
down every opposition </s>
<s>   they might in fact have borne down a great
deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them
beyond the want of graciousness and warmth </s>
<s>   sir walter made no
objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and
unconcerned </s>
<s>   captain wentworth with fiveandtwenty thousand pounds
and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him
was no longer nobody </s>
<s>   he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the
daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle
or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which
providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present
but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers
hereafter </s>
<s> 

sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity
flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from
thinking it a bad match for her </s>
<s>   on the contrary when he saw more of
captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well
he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her
superiority of rank </s>
<s>  and all this assisted by his wellsounding name
enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace
for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour </s>
<s> 

the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any
serious anxiety was lady russell </s>
<s>   anne knew that lady russell must be
suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and
be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do
justice to captain wentworth </s>
<s>   this however was what lady russell had
now to do </s>
<s>   she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with
regard to both </s>
<s>  that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in
each </s>
<s>  that because captain wentworths manners had not suited her own
ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a
character of dangerous impetuosity </s>
<s>  and that because mr elliots
manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness
their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in
receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and
wellregulated mind </s>
<s>   there was nothing less for lady russell to do
than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up
a new set of opinions and of hopes </s>
<s> 

there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment
of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in
others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of
understanding than her young friend </s>
<s>   but she was a very good woman
and if her second object was to be sensible and welljudging her first
was to see anne happy </s>
<s>   she loved anne better than she loved her own
abilities </s>
<s>  and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found
little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was
securing the happiness of her other child </s>
<s> 

of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance </s>
<s>   it was creditable to have a sister married and
she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the
connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn </s>
<s>  and as her own
sister must be better than her husbands sisters it was very agreeable
that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain
benwick or charles hayter </s>
<s>   she had something to suffer perhaps when
they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of
seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette </s>
<s>  but she had a
future to look forward to of powerful consolation </s>
<s>   anne had no
uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family </s>
<s> 
and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet
she would not change situations with anne </s>
<s> 

it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied
with her situation for a change is not very probable there </s>
<s>   she had
soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of
proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the
unfounded hopes which sunk with him </s>
<s> 

the news of his cousin annes engagement burst on mr elliot most
unexpectedly </s>
<s>   it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his
best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a
soninlaws rights would have given </s>
<s>   but though discomfited and
disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his
own enjoyment </s>
<s>   he soon quitted bath </s>
<s>  and on mrs clays quitting it
soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his
protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been
playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out
by one artful woman at least </s>
<s> 

mrs clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had
sacrificed for the young mans sake the possibility of scheming
longer for sir walter </s>
<s>   she has abilities however as well as
affections </s>
<s>  and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or
hers may finally carry the day </s>
<s>  whether after preventing her from
being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at
last into making her the wife of sir william </s>
<s> 

it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and
mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their
deception in her </s>
<s>   they had their great cousins to be sure to resort
to for comfort </s>
<s>  but they must long feel that to flatter and follow
others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of
half enjoyment </s>
<s> 

anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russells meaning to
love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the
happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of
having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value </s>
<s> 
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly </s>
<s>   the disproportion in
their fortune was nothing </s>
<s>  it did not give her a moments regret </s>
<s>  but
to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of
respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the
worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and
sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be
sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity </s>
<s>   she had
but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs
smith </s>
<s>   to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself </s>
<s> 
lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now
value from his heart </s>
<s>   while he was not obliged to say that he believed
her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say
almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had
claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently </s>
<s> 

her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and
their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her
two </s>
<s>   she was their earliest visitor in their settled life </s>
<s>  and captain
wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husbands
property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and
seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the
activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully
requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render
to his wife </s>
<s> 

mrs smiths enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income
with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to
be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail
her </s>
<s>  and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity </s>
<s>   she
might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be
happy </s>
<s>   her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her
friend annes was in the warmth of her heart </s>
<s>   anne was tenderness
itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworths
affection </s>
<s>   his profession was all that could ever make her friends
wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim
her sunshine </s>
<s>   she gloried in being a sailors wife but she must pay
the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if
possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its
national importance </s>
<s> 
<s> emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home
and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
existence </s>
<s>  and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world with very
little to distress or vex her </s>
<s> 

she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate
indulgent father </s>
<s>  and had in consequence of her sisters marriage been
mistress of his house from a very early period </s>
<s>  her mother had died
too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of
her caresses </s>
<s>  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection </s>
<s> 

sixteen years had miss taylor been in <abvr> woodhouses family less as a
governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly
of emma </s>
<s>  between them it was more the intimacy of sisters </s>
<s>  even before
miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the
mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint </s>
<s> 
and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been
living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma
doing just what she liked </s>
<s>  highly esteeming miss taylors judgment but
directed chiefly by her own </s>
<s> 

the real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too
well of herself </s>
<s>  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to
her many enjoyments </s>
<s>  the danger however was at present so unperceived
that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her </s>
<s> 

sorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness </s>
<s> miss taylor married </s>
<s>  it was miss taylors
loss which first brought grief </s>
<s>  it was on the weddingday of this
beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any
continuance </s>
<s>  the wedding over and the bridepeople gone her father and
herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer
a long evening </s>
<s>  her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as
usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost </s>
<s> 

the event had every promise of happiness for her friend </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and
pleasant manners </s>
<s>  and there was some satisfaction in considering
with what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished and
promoted the match </s>
<s>  but it was a black mornings work for her </s>
<s>  the want
of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day </s>
<s>  she recalled her
past kindnessthe kindness the affection of sixteen yearshow she had
taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had
devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how
nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood </s>
<s>  a large debt of
gratitude was owing here </s>
<s>  but the intercourse of the last seven
years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed
isabellas marriage on their being left to each other was yet a
dearer tenderer recollection </s>
<s>  she had been a friend and companion such
as few possessed </s>
<s>  intelligent wellinformed useful gentle knowing
all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and
peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of
hersone to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had
such an affection for her as could never find fault </s>
<s> 

how was she to bear the change </s>
<s> it was true that her friend was going
only half a mile from them </s>
<s>  but emma was aware that great must be the
difference between a <abvr> weston only half a mile from them and a miss
taylor in the house </s>
<s>  and with all her advantages natural and domestic
she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude </s>
<s>  she
dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her </s>
<s>  he could not
meet her in conversation rational or playful </s>
<s> 

the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and <abvr> woodhouse had
not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits </s>
<s> 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of
mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years </s>
<s>  and though
everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable
temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time </s>
<s> 

her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being
settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily
reach </s>
<s>  and many a long october and november evening must be struggled
through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from
isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house
and give her pleasant society again </s>
<s> 

highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town
to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and
name did really belong afforded her no equals </s>
<s>  the woodhouses

<s>  all looked up to them </s>
<s>  she had many
acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but
not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even
half a day </s>
<s>  it was a melancholy change </s>
<s>  and emma could not but sigh over
it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it
necessary to be cheerful </s>
<s>  his spirits required support </s>
<s>  he was a nervous
man easily depressed </s>
<s>  fond of every body that he was used to and
hating to part with them </s>
<s>  hating change of every kind </s>
<s>  matrimony as the
origin of change was always disagreeable </s>
<s>  and he was by no means yet
reconciled to his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her
but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too </s>
<s>  and from his
habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that
other people could feel differently from himself he was very much
disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for
them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the
rest of her life at hartfield </s>
<s>  emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully
as she could to keep him from such thoughts </s>
<s>  but when tea came it was
impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner

knightley </s>

if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means

chapter ii


mr </s>
<s>  weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property </s>
<s>  he had received a good education but on
succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed
for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged
and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering
into the militia of his county then embodied </s>
<s> 

captain weston was a general favourite </s>
<s>  and when the chances of his
military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire
family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized
except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were
full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend </s>
<s> 

miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her
fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestatewas
not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the
infinite mortification of <abvr> and <abvr> churchill who threw her off with
due decorum </s>
<s>  it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much
happiness </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston ought to have found more in it for she had a
husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due
to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him </s>
<s> 
but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best </s>
<s>  she had
resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother
but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brothers
unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home </s>
<s> 
they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison
of enscombe </s>
<s>  she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at
once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe </s>
<s> 

captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills
as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of
the bargain </s>
<s>  for when his wife died after a three years marriage he
was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain </s>
<s> 
from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved </s>
<s>  the boy
had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his
mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation </s>
<s>  and <abvr> and <abvr>
churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature
of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the
little frank soon after her decease </s>
<s>  some scruples and some reluctance
the widowerfather may be supposed to have felt </s>
<s>  but as they were
overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and
the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek
and his own situation to improve as he could </s>
<s> 

a complete change of life became desirable </s>
<s>  he quitted the militia and
engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in
london which afforded him a favourable opening </s>
<s>  it was a concern which
brought just employment enough </s>
<s>  he had still a small house in highbury
where most of his leisure days were spent </s>
<s>  and between useful occupation
and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his
life passed cheerfully away </s>
<s>  he had by that time realised an easy
competenceenough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining
highbury which he had always longed forenough to marry a woman as
portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of
his own friendly and social disposition </s>
<s> 

it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his
schemes </s>
<s>  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth
it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could
purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to </s>
<s> 
but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were
accomplished </s>
<s>  he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained
his wife </s>
<s>  and was beginning a new period of existence with every
probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through </s>
<s>  he had
never been an unhappy man </s>
<s>  his own temper had secured him from that
even in his first marriage </s>
<s>  but his second must shew him how delightful
a welljudging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the
pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be
chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it </s>
<s> 

he had only himself to please in his choice </s>
<s>  his fortune was his own </s>
<s> 
for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his
uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume
the name of churchill on coming of age </s>
<s>  it was most unlikely therefore
that he should ever want his fathers assistance </s>
<s>  his father had no
apprehension of it </s>
<s>  the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her
husband entirely </s>
<s>  but it was not in <abvr> westons nature to imagine that
any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he
believed so deservedly dear </s>
<s>  he saw his son every year in london and
was proud of him </s>
<s>  and his fond report of him as a very fine young man
had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too </s>
<s>  he was looked on as
sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a
kind of common concern </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life </s>
<s>  his coming to visit
his father had been often talked of but never achieved </s>
<s> 

now upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed as a
most proper attention that the visit should take place </s>
<s>  there was not a
dissentient voice on the subject either when <abvr> perry drank tea with
mrs </s>
<s>  and miss bates or when <abvr> and miss bates returned the visit </s>
<s>  now
was the time for <abvr> frank churchill to come among them </s>
<s>  and the hope
strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new
mother on the occasion </s>
<s>  for a few days every morning visit in highbury
included some mention of the handsome letter <abvr> weston had received </s>
<s> 
i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter <abvr> frank churchill
has written to <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i understand it was a very handsome letter
indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse told me of it </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse saw the letter and
he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life </s>
<s> 

it was indeed a highly prized letter </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had of course
formed a very favourable idea of the young man </s>
<s>  and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most
welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation
which her marriage had already secured </s>
<s>  she felt herself a most
fortunate woman </s>
<s>  and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate
she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial
separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and
who could ill bear to part with her </s>
<s> 

she knew that at times she must be missed </s>
<s>  and could not think without
pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering an hours ennui
from the want of her companionableness </s>
<s>  but dear emma was of no feeble
character </s>
<s>  she was more equal to her situation than most girls would
have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped
would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and
privations </s>
<s>  and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of
randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking
and in <abvr> westons disposition and circumstances which would make the
approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in
the week together </s>
<s> 

her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to <abvr>
weston and of moments only of regret </s>
<s>  and her satisfactionher more
than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent
that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize
at his being still able to pity òpoor miss taylor when they left her
at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away
in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her
own </s>
<s>  but never did she go without <abvr> woodhouses giving a gentle sigh
and saying ah poor miss taylor </s>
<s>  she would be very glad to stay </s>
<s> 

there was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of ceasing to
pity her </s>
<s>  but a few weeks brought some alleviation to <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s> 
the compliments of his neighbours were over </s>
<s>  he was no longer teased by
being wished joy of so sorrowful an event </s>
<s>  and the weddingcake which
had been a great distress to him was all eat up </s>
<s>  his own stomach
could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be
different from himself </s>
<s>  what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit
for any body </s>
<s>  and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them
from having any weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as
earnestly tried to prevent any bodys eating it </s>
<s>  he had been at the
pains of consulting <abvr> perry the apothecary on the subject </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry
was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of <abvr> woodhouses life </s>
<s>  and upon being applied to he
could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias
of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree with
manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately </s>
<s>  with such an
opinion in confirmation of his own <abvr> woodhouse hoped to influence
every visitor of the newly married pair </s>
<s>  but still the cake was eaten </s>
<s> 
and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone </s>
<s> 

there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being
seen with a slice of <abvr> westons weddingcake in their hands </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
woodhouse would never believe it </s>
<s> 



chapter iii


mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was fond of society in his own way </s>
<s>  he liked very much to
have his friends come and see him </s>
<s>  and from various united causes from
his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune
his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his
own little circle in a great measure as he liked </s>
<s>  he had not much
intercourse with any families beyond that circle </s>
<s>  his horror of late
hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit for any acquaintance but
such as would visit him on his own terms </s>
<s>  fortunately for him highbury
including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish
adjoining the seat of <abvr> knightley comprehended many such </s>
<s>  not
unfrequently through emmas persuasion he had some of the chosen and
the best to dine with him </s>
<s>  but evening parties were what he preferred </s>
<s> 
and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there
was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a
cardtable for him </s>
<s> 

real longstanding regard brought the westons and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and by
mr </s>
<s>  elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege
of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the
elegancies and society of <abvr> woodhouses drawingroom and the smiles
of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away </s>
<s> 

after these came a second set </s>
<s>  among the most comeatable of whom were
mrs </s>
<s>  and miss bates and <abvr> goddard three ladies almost always at
the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and
carried home so often that <abvr> woodhouse thought it no hardship for
either james or the horses </s>
<s>  had it taken place only once a year it
would have been a grievance </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old
lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille </s>
<s>  she lived with her
single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the
regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward
circumstances can excite </s>
<s>  her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree
of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married </s>
<s> 
miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having
much of the public favour </s>
<s>  and she had no intellectual superiority to
make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into
outward respect </s>
<s>  she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness </s>
<s>  her
youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible </s>
<s>  and yet she was a happy woman and a woman
whom no one named without goodwill </s>
<s>  it was her own universal goodwill
and contented temper which worked such wonders </s>
<s>  she loved every body
was interested in every bodys happiness quicksighted to every bodys
merits </s>
<s>  thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with
blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours
and friends and a home that wanted for nothing </s>
<s>  the simplicity and
cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a
recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself </s>
<s>  she was
a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited <abvr> woodhouse
full of trivial communications and harmless gossip </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary or an
establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of
refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality
upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous
pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real
honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable quantity of
accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might
be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little
education without any danger of coming back prodigies </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddards
school was in high reputeand very deservedly </s>
<s>  for highbury was
reckoned a particularly healthy spot </s>
<s>  she had an ample house and garden
gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great
deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own
hands </s>
<s>  it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her to church </s>
<s>  she was a plain motherly kind of woman who
had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the
occasional holiday of a teavisit </s>
<s>  and having formerly owed much to <abvr>
woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat
parlour hung round with fancywork whenever she could and win or lose
a few sixpences by his fireside </s>
<s> 

these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to
collect </s>
<s>  and happy was she for her fathers sake in the power </s>
<s>  though
as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and
very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well </s>
<s>  but the
quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so
spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated </s>
<s> 

as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the
present day a note was brought from <abvr> goddard requesting in most
respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her </s>
<s>  a most
welcome request </s>
<s>  for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew
very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of
her beauty </s>
<s>  a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no
longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion </s>
<s> 

harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody </s>
<s>  somebody had placed
her several years back at <abvr> goddards school and somebody
had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of
parlourboarder </s>
<s>  this was all that was generally known of her history </s>
<s> 
she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and
was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young
ladies who had been at school there with her </s>
<s> 

she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort
which emma particularly admired </s>
<s>  she was short plump and fair with a
fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great
sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased
with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths
conversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot
inconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing
shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed
by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had
been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement </s>
<s> 
encouragement should be given </s>
<s>  those soft blue eyes and all those
natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury
and its connexions </s>
<s>  the acquaintance she had already formed were
unworthy of her </s>
<s>  the friends from whom she had just parted though very
good sort of people must be doing her harm </s>
<s>  they were a family of the
name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large
farm of <abvr> knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery
creditably she believedshe knew <abvr> knightley thought highly of

intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect </s>
<s>  she would notice her </s>
<s>  she would improve her </s>
<s>  she
would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good
society </s>
<s>  she would form her opinions and her manners </s>
<s>  it would be an
interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking </s>
<s>  highly becoming her
own situation in life her leisure and powers </s>
<s> 

she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and
listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that the
evening flew away at a very unusual rate </s>
<s>  and the suppertable which
always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and
watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the
fire before she was aware </s>
<s>  with an alacrity beyond the common impulse
of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every
thing well and attentively with the real goodwill of a mind delighted
with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and
help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an
urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil
scruples of their guests </s>
<s> 

upon such occasions poor <abvr> woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare </s>
<s> 
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his
youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him
rather sorry to see any thing put on it </s>
<s>  and while his hospitality would
have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health
made him grieve that they would eat </s>
<s> 

such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could
with thorough selfapprobation recommend </s>
<s>  though he might constrain
himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to
say </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs </s>
<s>  an egg
boiled very soft is not unwholesome </s>
<s>  serle understands boiling an egg
better than any body </s>

emma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in a much
more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular
pleasure in sending them away happy </s>
<s>  the happiness of miss smith was
quite equal to her intentions </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse was so great a personage
in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much
panic as pleasure </s>

highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss
woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands
with her at last </s>

chapter iv


harriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing </s>
<s>  quick
and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and
telling her to come very often </s>
<s>  and as their acquaintance increased so
did their satisfaction in each other </s>
<s>  as a walking companion emma had
very early foreseen how useful she might find her </s>
<s>  in that respect
mrs </s>
<s>  westons loss had been important </s>
<s>  her father never went beyond the
shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long
walk or his short as the year varied </s>

her exercise had been too much confined </s>
<s>  she had ventured once alone to
randalls but it was not pleasant </s>
<s>  and a harriet smith therefore
one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable
addition to her privileges </s>
<s>  but in every respect as she saw more of
her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs </s>
<s> 

harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful
disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be
guided by any one she looked up to </s>
<s>  her early attachment to herself
was very amiable </s>
<s>  and her inclination for good company and power of
appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no
want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected </s>
<s> 
altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smiths being exactly the
young friend she wantedexactly the something which her home required </s>
<s> 
such a friend as <abvr> weston was out of the question </s>
<s>  two such could
never be granted </s>
<s>  two such she did not want </s>
<s>  it was quite a different
sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was the
object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem </s>
<s>  harriet
would be loved as one to whom she could be useful </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston there
was nothing to be done </s>
<s>  for harriet every thing </s>
<s> 

her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents but harriet could not tell </s>
<s>  she was ready to tell
every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain </s>
<s>  emma
was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never believe that in

had no penetration </s>
<s>  she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard chose to tell her </s>
<s>  and looked no farther </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of
the school in general formed naturally a great part of the
conversationand but for her acquaintance with the martins of

her thoughts a good deal </s>

and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place </s>
<s>  emma encouraged her
talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of <abvr> martins having two parlours two very good
parlours indeed </s>
<s>  one of them quite as large as <abvr> goddards
drawingroom </s>
<s>  and of her having an upper maid who had lived
fiveandtwenty years with her </s>
<s>  and of their having eight cows two of
them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch
cow indeed </s>
<s>  and of <abvr> martins saying as she was so fond of it
it should be called her cow </s>
<s>  and of their having a very handsome
summerhouse in their garden where some day next year they were all to
drink tea </s>
<s> a very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen
people </s>
<s> 

for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate
cause </s>
<s>  but as she came to understand the family better other feelings
arose </s>
<s>  she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and
daughter a son and sons wife who all lived together </s>
<s>  but when it
appeared that the <abvr> martin who bore a part in the narrative and was
always mentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing
something or other was a single man </s>
<s>  that there was no young <abvr>
martin no wife in the case </s>
<s>  she did suspect danger to her poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not
taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever </s>
<s> 

with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and
meaning </s>
<s>  and she particularly led harriet to talk more of <abvr> martin
and there was evidently no dislike to it </s>
<s>  harriet was very ready to
speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening
games </s>
<s>  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured and
obliging </s>
<s>  he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her
some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in
every thing else he was so very obliging </s>
<s>  he had his shepherds son into
the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her </s>
<s>  she was very fond
of singing </s>
<s>  he could sing a little himself </s>
<s>  she believed he was very
clever and understood every thing </s>
<s>  he had a very fine flock and while
she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in
the country </s>
<s>  she believed every body spoke well of him </s>
<s>  his mother and
sisters were very fond of him </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin had told her one day and
there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he
would make a good husband </s>
<s>  not that she wanted him to marry </s>
<s>  she was
in no hurry at all </s>
<s> 

well done <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  thought emma </s>
<s>  you know what you are about </s>
<s> 

and when she had come away <abvr> martin was so very kind as to send
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose <abvr> goddard had ever
seen </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three
teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with
her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of
his own business </s>
<s>  he does not read </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> that is noi do not knowbut i believe he has read a
good dealbut not what you would think any thing of </s>
<s>  he reads the
agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window
seatsbut he reads all them to himself </s>
<s>  but sometimes of an evening
before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the
elegant extracts very entertaining </s>
<s>  and i know he has read the vicar of
wakefield </s>
<s>  he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of
the abbey </s>
<s>  he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but
he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can </s>
<s> 

the next question was

what sort of looking man is <abvr> martin </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  not handsomenot at all handsome </s>
<s>  i thought him very plain at
first but i do not think him so plain now </s>
<s>  one does not you know
after a time </s>
<s>  but did you never see him </s>
<s>  he is in highbury every now and
then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston </s>
<s> 
he has passed you very often </s>
<s> 

that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having
any idea of his name </s>
<s>  a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot
is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity </s>
<s>  the yeomanry are
precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do </s>
<s> 
a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me </s>
<s> 
i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other </s>
<s>  but
a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as
much above my notice as in every other he is below it </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  oh yes </s>
<s>  it is not likely you should ever have observed him </s>
<s> 
but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man </s>
<s>  i know
indeed that he is so and as such wish him well </s>
<s>  what do you imagine
his age to be </s>
<s> 

he was fourandtwenty the th of last june and my birthday is the
rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd </s>
<s> 

only fourandtwenty </s>
<s>  that is too young to settle </s>
<s>  his mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry </s>
<s>  they seem very comfortable as they
are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably
repent it </s>
<s>  six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young
woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very
desirable </s>
<s> 

six years hence </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old </s>
<s> 

well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not
born to an independence </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin i imagine has his fortune entirely
to makecannot be at all beforehand with the world </s>
<s>  whatever money he
might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family
property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and
so forth </s>
<s>  and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in
time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing
yet </s>
<s> 

to be sure so it is </s>
<s>  but they live very comfortably </s>
<s>  they have no
indoors man else they do not want for any thing </s>
<s>  and <abvr> martin talks
of taking a boy another year </s>
<s> 

i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does
marry </s>
<s> i mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though his
sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected
to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you
to notice </s>
<s>  the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates </s>
<s>  there can be no doubt of your being a
gentlemans daughter and you must support your claim to that station by
every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who
would take pleasure in degrading you </s>
<s> 

yes to be sure i suppose there are </s>
<s>  but while i visit at hartfield
and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any
body can do </s>
<s> 

you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet </s>
<s>  but i would
have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent
even of hartfield and miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i want to see you permanently
well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd
acquaintance as may be </s>
<s>  and therefore i say that if you should still
be in this country when <abvr> martin marries i wish you may not be drawn
in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife
who will probably be some mere farmers daughter without education </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  not that i think <abvr> martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some educationand been very well brought up </s>
<s>  however
i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i am sure i shall
not wish for the acquaintance of his wife </s>
<s>  i shall always have a great
regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very
sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me </s>
<s>  but
if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not
visit her if i can help it </s>
<s> 

emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no
alarming symptoms of love </s>
<s>  the young man had been the first admirer but
she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious
difficulty on harriets side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her
own </s>
<s> 

they met <abvr> martin the very next day as they were walking on the
donwell road </s>
<s>  he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at
her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion </s>
<s>  emma was
not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey </s>
<s>  and walking a few
yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye
sufficiently acquainted with <abvr> robert martin </s>
<s>  his appearance was very
neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no
other advantage </s>
<s>  and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen
she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriets
inclination </s>
<s>  harriet was not insensible of manner </s>
<s>  she had voluntarily
noticed her fathers gentleness with admiration as well as wonder </s>
<s>  <abvr>
martin looked as if he did not know what manner was </s>
<s> 

they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be
kept waiting </s>
<s>  and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face
and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to
compose </s>
<s> 

only think of our happening to meet him </s>
<s> how very odd </s>
<s>  it was quite
a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls </s>
<s>  he did not
think we ever walked this road </s>
<s>  he thought we walked towards randalls
most days </s>
<s>  he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet </s>
<s> 
he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it
but he goes again tomorrow </s>
<s>  so very odd we should happen to meet </s>
<s>  well
miss woodhouse is he like what you expected </s>
<s>  what do you think of him </s>
<s> 
do you think him so very plain </s>
<s> 

he is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plain </s>
<s> but that is nothing
compared with his entire want of gentility </s>
<s>  i had no right to expect
much and i did not expect much </s>
<s>  but i had no idea that he could be so
very clownish so totally without air </s>
<s>  i had imagined him i confess a
degree or two nearer gentility </s>
<s> 

to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel
as real gentlemen </s>
<s> 

i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you
must yourself be struck with the difference in <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  at hartfield
you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men </s>
<s>  i
should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company
with <abvr> martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior
creatureand rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him
at all agreeable before </s>
<s>  do not you begin to feel that now </s>
<s>  were not
you struck </s>
<s>  i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and
abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly
unmodulated as i stood here </s>
<s> 

certainly he is not like <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he has not such a fine air and
way of walking as <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i see the difference plain enough </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  knightley is so very fine a man </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to
compare <abvr> martin with him </s>
<s>  you might not see one in a hundred with
gentleman so plainly written as in <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  but he is not the
only gentleman you have been lately used to </s>
<s>  what say you to <abvr> weston
and <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  compare <abvr> martin with either of them </s>
<s>  compare their
manner of carrying themselves </s>
<s>  of walking </s>
<s>  of speaking </s>
<s>  of being silent </s>
<s> 
you must see the difference </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s> there is a great difference </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston is almost an old
man </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston must be between forty and fifty </s>
<s> 

which makes his good manners the more valuable </s>
<s>  the older a person
grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not
be bad </s>
<s>  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or
awkwardness becomes </s>
<s>  what is passable in youth is detestable in later
age </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin is now awkward and abrupt </s>
<s>  what will he be at <abvr>
westons time of life </s>
<s> 

there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly </s>
<s> 

but there may be pretty good guessing </s>
<s>  he will be a completely gross
vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of
nothing but profit and loss </s>
<s> 

will he indeed </s>
<s>  that will be very bad </s>
<s> 

how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended </s>
<s> 
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
elsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man </s>
<s>  what has he to
do with books </s>
<s>  and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very
rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb
us </s>
<s> 

i wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer and
spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be
safely left to itself </s>
<s>  she therefore said no more for some time </s>
<s>  her
next beginning was

in one respect perhaps <abvr> eltons manners are superior to <abvr>
knightleys or <abvr> westons </s>
<s>  they have more gentleness </s>
<s>  they might be
more safely held up as a pattern </s>
<s>  there is an openness a quickness
almost a bluntness in <abvr> weston which every body likes in him
because there is so much goodhumour with itbut that would not do to
be copied </s>
<s>  neither would <abvr> knightleys downright decided commanding
sort of manner though it suits him very well </s>
<s>  his figure and look
and situation in life seem to allow it </s>
<s>  but if any young man were to set
about copying him he would not be sufferable </s>
<s>  on the contrary i think
a young man might be very safely recommended to take <abvr> elton as a
model </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle </s>
<s> 
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late </s>
<s>  i do not know
whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us
harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are
softer than they used to be </s>
<s>  if he means any thing it must be to please
you </s>
<s>  did not i tell you what he said of you the other day </s>
<s> 

she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from <abvr>
elton and now did full justice to </s>
<s>  and harriet blushed and smiled and
said she had always thought <abvr> elton very agreeable </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young
farmer out of harriets head </s>
<s>  she thought it would be an excellent
match </s>
<s>  and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her
to have much merit in planning it </s>
<s>  she feared it was what every body
else must think of and predict </s>
<s>  it was not likely however that any
body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had
entered her brain during the very first evening of harriets coming to
hartfield </s>
<s>  the longer she considered it the greater was her sense
of its expediency </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons situation was most suitable quite the
gentleman himself and without low connexions </s>
<s>  at the same time not of
any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet </s>
<s> 
he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient
income </s>
<s>  for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known
to have some independent property </s>
<s>  and she thought very highly of him
as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man without any
deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world </s>
<s> 

she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful
girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was
foundation enough on his side </s>
<s>  and on harriets there could be little
doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual
weight and efficacy </s>
<s>  and he was really a very pleasing young man a
young man whom any woman not fastidious might like </s>
<s>  he was reckoned very
handsome </s>
<s>  his person much admired in general though not by her
there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense
with </s>
<s> but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martins riding
about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by
mr </s>
<s>  eltons admiration </s>

chapter v


i do not know what your opinion may be <abvr> weston said <abvr>
knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i
think it a bad thing </s>
<s> 

a bad thing </s>
<s>  do you really think it a bad thing </s>
<s> why so </s>
<s> 

i think they will neither of them do the other any good </s>
<s> 

you surprize me </s>
<s>  emma must do harriet good </s>
<s>  and by supplying her with a
new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good </s>
<s>  i have been
seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure </s>
<s>  how very differently
we feel </s>
<s> not think they will do each other any good </s>
<s>  this will
certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> 

perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing
weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks
exactly as i do on the subject </s>
<s>  we were speaking of it only yesterday
and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a
girl in highbury for her to associate with </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley i shall not
allow you to be a fair judge in this case </s>
<s>  you are so much used to live
alone that you do not know the value of a companion </s>
<s>  and perhaps no
man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of
one of her own sex after being used to it all her life </s>
<s>  i can imagine
your objection to harriet smith </s>
<s>  she is not the superior young woman
which emmas friend ought to be </s>
<s>  but on the other hand as emma wants
to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more
herself </s>
<s>  they will read together </s>
<s>  she means it i know </s>
<s> 

emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old </s>
<s> 
i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at various times of
books that she meant to read regularly throughand very good lists
they werevery well chosen and very neatly arrangedsometimes
alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule </s>
<s>  the list she drew
up when only fourteeni remember thinking it did her judgment so much
credit that i preserved it some time </s>
<s>  and i dare say she may have made
out a very good list now </s>
<s>  but i have done with expecting any course of
steady reading from emma </s>
<s>  she will never submit to any thing
requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the
understanding </s>
<s>  where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely
affirm that harriet smith will do nothing </s>
<s> you never could persuade her
to read half so much as you wished </s>
<s> you know you could not </s>
<s> 

i dare say replied <abvr> weston smiling that i thought so
then </s>
<s> but since we have parted i can never remember emmas omitting
to do any thing i wished </s>
<s> 

there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid
mr </s>
<s>  knightley feelingly </s>
<s>  and for a moment or two he had done </s>
<s>  but i
 he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must
still see hear and remember </s>
<s>  emma is spoiled by being the cleverest
of her family </s>
<s>  at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to
answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen </s>
<s>  she was always
quick and assured </s>
<s>  isabella slow and diffident </s>
<s>  and ever since she
was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all </s>
<s>  in her
mother she lost the only person able to cope with her </s>
<s>  she inherits her
mothers talents and must have been under subjection to her </s>
<s> 

i should have been sorry <abvr> knightley to be dependent on your
recommendation had i quitted <abvr> woodhouses family and wanted another
situation </s>
<s>  i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to
any body </s>
<s>  i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held </s>
<s> 

yes said he smiling </s>
<s>  you are better placed here </s>
<s>  very fit for a
wife but not at all for a governess </s>
<s>  but you were preparing yourself to
be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield </s>
<s>  you might
not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to
promise </s>
<s>  but you were receiving a very good education from her on the
very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing
as you were bid </s>
<s>  and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i
should certainly have named miss taylor </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  there will be very little merit in making a good wife to
such a man as <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that
with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne </s>
<s>  we
will not despair however </s>
<s>  weston may grow cross from the wantonness of
comfort or his son may plague him </s>
<s> 

i hope not that </s>
<s> it is not likely </s>
<s>  no <abvr> knightley do not
foretell vexation from that quarter </s>
<s> 

not i indeed </s>
<s>  i only name possibilities </s>
<s>  i do not pretend to emmas
genius for foretelling and guessing </s>
<s>  i hope with all my heart the
young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune </s>
<s> but
harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith </s>
<s>  i think her the
very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have </s>
<s>  she knows
nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing </s>
<s>  she is a
flatterer in all her ways </s>
<s>  and so much the worse because undesigned </s>
<s> 
her ignorance is hourly flattery </s>
<s>  how can emma imagine she has any
thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful
inferiority </s>
<s>  and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot
gain by the acquaintance </s>
<s>  hartfield will only put her out of conceit
with all the other places she belongs to </s>
<s>  she will grow just refined
enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances
have placed her home </s>
<s>  i am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any
strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally
to the varieties of her situation in life </s>
<s> they only give a little
polish </s>
<s> 

i either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more
anxious for her present comfort </s>
<s>  for i cannot lament the acquaintance </s>
<s> 
how well she looked last night </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you </s>
<s>  very
well </s>
<s>  i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty </s>
<s> 

pretty </s>
<s>  say beautiful rather </s>
<s>  can you imagine any thing nearer perfect
beauty than emma altogetherface and figure </s>
<s> 

i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom
seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers </s>
<s>  but i am a partial
old friend </s>
<s> 

such an eye </s>
<s> the true hazle eyeand so brilliant </s>
<s>  regular features
open countenance with a complexion </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  what a bloom of full health
and such a pretty height and size </s>
<s>  such a firm and upright figure </s>
<s> 
there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her
glance </s>
<s>  one hears sometimes of a child being òthe picture of health </s>
<s> 
now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of
grownup health </s>
<s>  she is loveliness itself </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley is not she </s>
<s> 

i have not a fault to find with her person he replied </s>
<s>  i think her
all you describe </s>
<s>  i love to look at her </s>
<s>  and i will add this praise
that i do not think her personally vain </s>
<s>  considering how very handsome
she is she appears to be little occupied with it </s>
<s>  her vanity lies
another way </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of
harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm </s>
<s> 

and i <abvr> knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not
doing them any harm </s>
<s>  with all dear emmas little faults she is an
excellent creature </s>
<s>  where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder
sister or a truer friend </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s>  she has qualities which may be
trusted </s>
<s>  she will never lead any one really wrong </s>
<s>  she will make no
lasting blunder </s>
<s>  where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred
times </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  i will not plague you any more </s>
<s>  emma shall be an angel and
i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella </s>
<s> 
john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection
and isabella always thinks as he does </s>
<s>  except when he is not quite
frightened enough about the children </s>
<s>  i am sure of having their opinions
with me </s>
<s> 

i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind </s>
<s> 
but excuse me <abvr> knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself
you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas
mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any
possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made a
matter of much discussion among you </s>
<s>  pray excuse me </s>
<s>  but supposing any
little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be
expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly
approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a
source of pleasure to herself </s>
<s>  it has been so many years my province to
give advice that you cannot be surprized <abvr> knightley at this little
remains of office </s>
<s> 

not at all cried he </s>
<s>  i am much obliged to you for it </s>
<s>  it is very
good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often
found </s>
<s>  for it shall be attended to </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about
her sister </s>
<s> 

be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry </s>
<s>  i will keep my
illhumour to myself </s>
<s>  i have a very sincere interest in emma </s>
<s>  isabella
does not seem more my sister </s>
<s>  has never excited a greater interest </s>
<s> 
perhaps hardly so great </s>
<s>  there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one
feels for emma </s>
<s>  i wonder what will become of her </s>
<s> 

so do i said <abvr> weston gently very much </s>
<s> 

she always declares she will never marry which of course means just
nothing at all </s>
<s>  but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she
cared for </s>
<s>  it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love
with a proper object </s>

doubt of a return </s>

to attach her </s>

there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution

happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which

do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight

part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own
and <abvr> westons on the subject as much as possible </s>

at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it was not desirable to
have them suspected </s>

chapter vi


emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy a proper
direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good
purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of <abvr>
eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners </s>
<s> 
and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his
admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating
as much liking on harriets side as there could be any occasion for </s>
<s> 
she was quite convinced of <abvr> eltons being in the fairest way of
falling in love if not in love already </s>
<s>  she had no scruple with regard
to him </s>
<s>  he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add </s>
<s>  his
perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner since her
introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of
his growing attachment </s>
<s> 

you have given miss smith all that she required said he </s>
<s>  you have
made her graceful and easy </s>
<s>  she was a beautiful creature when she
came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are
infinitely superior to what she received from nature </s>
<s> 

i am glad you think i have been useful to her </s>
<s>  but harriet only wanted
drawing out and receiving a few very few hints </s>
<s>  she had all the
natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself </s>
<s>  i have
done very little </s>
<s> 

if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant <abvr>
elton

i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have
taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before </s>
<s> 

exactly so </s>
<s>  that is what principally strikes me </s>
<s>  so much superadded
decision of character </s>
<s>  skilful has been the hand </s>
<s> 

great has been the pleasure i am sure </s>
<s>  i never met with a disposition
more truly amiable </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of it </s>
<s>  and it was spoken with a sort of sighing
animation which had a vast deal of the lover </s>
<s>  she was not less pleased
another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers
to have harriets picture </s>
<s> 

did you ever have your likeness taken harriet </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  did you
ever sit for your picture </s>
<s> 

harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say
with a very interesting naivete

oh </s>
<s>  dear no never </s>
<s> 

no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed

what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be </s>
<s>  i would
give any money for it </s>
<s>  i almost long to attempt her likeness myself </s>
<s> 
you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great
passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and
was thought to have a tolerable eye in general </s>
<s>  but from one cause or
another i gave it up in disgust </s>
<s>  but really i could almost venture
if harriet would sit to me </s>
<s>  it would be such a delight to have her
picture </s>
<s> 

let me entreat you cried <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  it would indeed be a delight </s>
<s> 
let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent
in favour of your friend </s>
<s>  i know what your drawings are </s>
<s>  how could
you suppose me ignorant </s>
<s>  is not this room rich in specimens of your
landscapes and flowers </s>
<s>  and has not <abvr> weston some inimitable
figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls </s>
<s> 

yes good man </s>
<s> thought emmabut what has all that to do with taking
likenesses </s>
<s>  you know nothing of drawing </s>
<s>  dont pretend to be in raptures
about mine </s>
<s>  keep your raptures for harriets face </s>
<s>  well if you give me
such kind encouragement <abvr> elton i believe i shall try what i can do </s>
<s> 
harriets features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult </s>
<s> 
and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines
about the mouth which one ought to catch </s>
<s> 

exactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi have
not a doubt of your success </s>
<s>  pray pray attempt it </s>
<s>  as you will do it
it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession </s>
<s> 

but i am afraid <abvr> elton harriet will not like to sit </s>
<s>  she thinks
so little of her own beauty </s>
<s>  did not you observe her manner of answering
me </s>
<s>  how completely it meant òwhy should my picture be drawn </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i observed it i assure you </s>
<s>  it was not lost on me </s>
<s>  but still
i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded </s>
<s> 

harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made </s>
<s> 
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the
earnest pressing of both the others </s>
<s>  emma wished to go to work directly
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at
portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might
decide together on the best size for harriet </s>
<s>  her many beginnings were
displayed </s>
<s>  miniatures halflengths wholelengths pencil crayon and
watercolours had been all tried in turn </s>
<s>  she had always wanted to do
every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than
many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to </s>
<s> 
she played and sang </s>
<s> and drew in almost every style </s>
<s>  but steadiness
had always been wanting </s>
<s>  and in nothing had she approached the degree of
excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to
have failed of </s>
<s>  she was not much deceived as to her own skill either
as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others
deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often
higher than it deserved </s>
<s> 

there was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the
most </s>
<s>  her style was spirited </s>
<s>  but had there been much less or had there
been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions
would have been the same </s>
<s>  they were both in ecstasies </s>
<s>  a likeness
pleases every body </s>
<s>  and miss woodhouses performances must be capital </s>
<s> 

no great variety of faces for you said emma </s>
<s>  i had only my own
family to study from </s>
<s>  there is my fatheranother of my fatherbut the
idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only
take him by stealth </s>
<s>  neither of them very like therefore </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
again and again and again you see </s>
<s>  dear <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  always my
kindest friend on every occasion </s>
<s>  she would sit whenever i asked her </s>
<s> 
there is my sister </s>
<s>  and really quite her own little elegant figure </s>
<s> and
the face not unlike </s>
<s>  i should have made a good likeness of her if she
would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw
her four children that she would not be quiet </s>
<s>  then here come all my
attempts at three of those four children </s>
<s> there they are henry and
john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of
them might do for any one of the rest </s>
<s>  she was so eager to have them
drawn that i could not refuse </s>
<s>  but there is no making children of three
or four years old stand still you know </s>
<s>  nor can it be very easy to take
any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are
coarser featured than any of mamas children ever were </s>
<s>  here is my
sketch of the fourth who was a baby </s>
<s>  i took him as he was sleeping on
the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would
wish to see </s>
<s>  he had nestled down his head most conveniently </s>
<s>  thats very
like </s>
<s>  i am rather proud of little george </s>
<s>  the corner of the sofa is very
good </s>
<s>  then here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother <abvr> john
knightley </s>
<s> this did not want much of being finished when i put it away
in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness </s>
<s>  i could not
help being provoked </s>
<s>  for after all my pains and when i had really made
a very good likeness of itmrs </s>
<s>  weston and i were quite agreed in
thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo flatteringbut
that was a fault on the right sideafter all this came poor dear
isabellas cold approbation ofyes it was a little likebut to be
sure it did not do him justice </s>
<s>  we had had a great deal of trouble
in persuading him to sit at all </s>
<s>  it was made a great favour of </s>
<s>  and
altogether it was more than i could bear </s>
<s>  and so i never would finish
it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every
morning visitor in brunswick square </s>
<s> and as i said i did then
forswear ever drawing any body again </s>
<s>  but for harriets sake or rather
for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at
present i will break my resolution now </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was
repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as
you observe </s>
<s>  exactly so </s>
<s>  no husbands and wives with so interesting a
consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better
leave them together at once </s>
<s>  but as she wanted to be drawing the
declaration must wait a little longer </s>
<s> 

she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait </s>
<s>  it was to be
a wholelength in watercolours like <abvr> john knightleys and was
destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station
over the mantelpiece </s>
<s> 

the sitting began </s>
<s>  and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not
keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of
youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist </s>
<s>  but there was no
doing any thing with <abvr> elton fidgeting behind her and watching every
touch </s>
<s>  she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze
and gaze again without offence </s>
<s>  but was really obliged to put an end to
it and request him to place himself elsewhere </s>
<s>  it then occurred to her
to employ him in reading </s>
<s> 

if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness
indeed </s>
<s>  it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the
irksomeness of miss smiths </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was only too happy </s>
<s>  harriet listened and emma drew in peace </s>
<s> 
she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look </s>
<s>  any thing less
would certainly have been too little in a lover </s>
<s>  and he was ready at the
smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress
and be charmed </s>
<s> there was no being displeased with such an encourager
for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it
was possible </s>
<s>  she could not respect his eye but his love and his
complaisance were unexceptionable </s>
<s> 

the sitting was altogether very satisfactory </s>
<s>  she was quite enough
pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on </s>
<s>  there was no want
of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant
to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more
height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of
its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling
its destined place with credit to them botha standing memorial of the
beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both </s>
<s> 
with as many other agreeable associations as <abvr> eltons very promising
attachment was likely to add </s>
<s> 

harriet was to sit again the next day </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton just as he ought
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again </s>
<s> 

by all means </s>
<s>  we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the
party </s>
<s> 

the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction
took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the
picture which was rapid and happy </s>
<s>  every body who saw it was pleased
but <abvr> elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every
criticism </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she
wantedobserved <abvr> weston to himnot in the least suspecting that
she was addressing a lover </s>
<s> the expression of the eye is most correct
but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes </s>
<s>  it is the fault of
her face that she has them not </s>
<s> 

do you think so </s>
<s>  replied he </s>
<s>  i cannot agree with you </s>
<s>  it appears
to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature </s>
<s>  i never saw such a
likeness in my life </s>
<s>  we must allow for the effect of shade you know </s>
<s> 

you have made her too tall emma said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 

emma knew that she had but would not own it </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton warmly
added

oh no </s>
<s>  certainly not too tall </s>
<s>  not in the least too tall </s>
<s>  consider she
is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich in short
gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must be preserved you know </s>
<s> 
proportions foreshortening </s>
<s> oh no </s>
<s>  it gives one exactly the idea of
such a height as miss smiths </s>
<s>  exactly so indeed </s>
<s> 

it is very pretty said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  so prettily done </s>
<s>  just as your
drawings always are my dear </s>
<s>  i do not know any body who draws so well
as you do </s>
<s>  the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems
to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her
shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold </s>
<s> 

but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer </s>
<s>  a warm day in summer </s>
<s> 
look at the tree </s>
<s> 

but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear </s>
<s> 

you sir may say any thing cried <abvr> elton but i must confess that
i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of
doors </s>
<s>  and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit </s>
<s>  any other
situation would have been much less in character </s>
<s>  the naivete of miss
smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is most admirable </s>
<s>  i cannot keep
my eyes from it </s>
<s>  i never saw such a likeness </s>
<s> 

the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed </s>
<s>  and here were a few
difficulties </s>
<s>  it must be done directly </s>
<s>  it must be done in london </s>
<s>  the
order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on </s>
<s>  and isabella the usual doer of all commissions
must not be applied to because it was december and <abvr> woodhouse
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of
december </s>
<s>  but no sooner was the distress known to <abvr> elton than it
was removed </s>
<s>  his gallantry was always on the alert </s>
<s>  might he be trusted
with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing
it </s>
<s>  he could ride to london at any time </s>
<s>  it was impossible to say how
much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand </s>
<s> 

he was too good </s>
<s> she could not endure the thought </s>
<s> she would not give
him such a troublesome office for the worldbrought on the desired
repetition of entreaties and assurancesand a very few minutes settled
the business </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give
the directions </s>
<s>  and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its
safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of
not being incommoded enough </s>
<s> 

what a precious deposit </s>
<s>  said he with a tender sigh as he received
it </s>
<s> 

this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma </s>
<s>  i should
say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of
being in love </s>
<s>  he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet
exactly </s>
<s>  it will be an òexactly so as he says himself </s>
<s>  but he does
sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could
endure as a principal </s>
<s>  i come in for a pretty good share as a second </s>
<s> 
but it is his gratitude on harriets account </s>
<s> 



chapter vii


the very day of <abvr> eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion
for emmas services towards her friend </s>
<s>  harriet had been at hartfield
as usual soon after breakfast </s>
<s>  and after a time had gone home to
return again to dinner </s>
<s>  she returned and sooner than had been
talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell </s>
<s>  half a
minute brought it all out </s>
<s>  she had heard as soon as she got back to
mrs </s>
<s>  goddards that <abvr> martin had been there an hour before and
finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a
little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away </s>
<s>  and on
opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which
she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself </s>
<s>  and this letter was
from him from <abvr> martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage </s>
<s> 
who could have thought it </s>
<s>  she was so surprized she did not know what
to do </s>
<s>  yes quite a proposal of marriage </s>
<s>  and a very good letter
at least she thought so </s>
<s>  and he wrote as if he really loved her very
muchbut she did not knowand so she was come as fast as she could to
ask miss woodhouse what she should do </s>
<s>  emma was halfashamed of her
friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful </s>
<s> 

upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any
thing for want of asking </s>
<s>  he will connect himself well if he can </s>
<s> 

will you read the letter </s>
<s>  cried harriet </s>
<s>  pray do </s>
<s>  id rather you
would </s>
<s> 

emma was not sorry to be pressed </s>
<s>  she read and was surprized </s>
<s>  the style
of the letter was much above her expectation </s>
<s>  there were not merely no
grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a
gentleman </s>
<s>  the language though plain was strong and unaffected and
the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer </s>
<s>  it was
short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety
even delicacy of feeling </s>
<s>  she paused over it while harriet stood
anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last
forced to add is it a good letter </s>
<s>  or is it too short </s>
<s> 

yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso
good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his
sisters must have helped him </s>
<s>  i can hardly imagine the young man whom
i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if
left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman </s>
<s> 
no certainly it is too strong and concise </s>
<s>  not diffuse enough for a
woman </s>
<s>  no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural
talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in
hand his thoughts naturally find proper words </s>
<s>  it is so with some men </s>
<s> 
yes i understand the sort of mind </s>
<s>  vigorous decided with sentiments
to a certain point not coarse </s>
<s>  a better written letter harriet
returning it than i had expected </s>
<s> 

well said the still waiting harriet </s>
<s> wellandand what shall i
do </s>
<s> 

what shall you do </s>
<s>  in what respect </s>
<s>  do you mean with regard to this
letter </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

but what are you in doubt of </s>
<s>  you must answer it of courseand
speedily </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but what shall i say </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse do advise me </s>
<s> 

oh no no </s>
<s>  the letter had much better be all your own </s>
<s>  you will express
yourself very properly i am sure </s>
<s>  there is no danger of your not
being intelligible which is the first thing </s>
<s>  your meaning must be
unequivocal </s>
<s>  no doubts or demurs </s>
<s>  and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will
present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded </s>
<s>  you need
not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his
disappointment </s>
<s> 

you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down </s>
<s> 

ought to refuse him </s>
<s>  my dear harriet what do you mean </s>
<s>  are you in any
doubt as to that </s>
<s>  i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i have been
under a mistake </s>
<s>  i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel
in doubt as to the purport of your answer </s>
<s>  i had imagined you were
consulting me only as to the wording of it </s>
<s> 

harriet was silent </s>
<s>  with a little reserve of manner emma continued </s>
<s> 

you mean to return a favourable answer i collect </s>
<s> 

no i do not </s>
<s>  that is i do not meanwhat shall i do </s>
<s>  what would you
advise me to do </s>
<s>  pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do </s>
<s> 

i shall not give you any advice harriet </s>
<s>  i will have nothing to do
with it </s>
<s>  this is a point which you must settle with your feelings </s>
<s> 

i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet
contemplating the letter </s>
<s>  for a little while emma persevered in her
silence </s>
<s>  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say

i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as
to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse
him </s>
<s>  if she can hesitate as to òyes she ought to say òno directly </s>
<s> 
it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with
half a heart </s>
<s>  i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself
to say thus much to you </s>
<s>  but do not imagine that i want to influence
you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would
just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean thatas
you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should not be
hesitatingit is a very serious thing </s>
<s> it will be safer to say òno
perhaps </s>
<s> do you think i had better say òno </s>
<s> 

not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you
either way </s>
<s>  you must be the best judge of your own happiness </s>
<s>  if you
prefer <abvr> martin to every other person </s>
<s>  if you think him the most
agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you
hesitate </s>
<s>  you blush harriet </s>
<s> does any body else occur to you at
this moment under such a definition </s>
<s>  harriet harriet do not deceive
yourself </s>
<s>  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion </s>
<s>  at this
moment whom are you thinking of </s>
<s> 

the symptoms were favourable </s>
<s> instead of answering harriet turned away
confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire </s>
<s>  and though the letter was
still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard </s>
<s> 
emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes </s>
<s>  at
last with some hesitation harriet said

miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well
as i can by myself </s>
<s>  and i have now quite determined and really almost
made up my mindto refuse <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  do you think i am right </s>
<s> 

perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet </s>
<s>  you are doing just
what you ought </s>
<s>  while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to
myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation
in approving </s>
<s>  dear harriet i give myself joy of this </s>
<s>  it would
have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the
consequence of your marrying <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  while you were in the smallest
degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence </s>
<s> 
but it would have been the loss of a friend to me </s>
<s>  i could not have
visited <abvr> robert martin of abbeymill farm </s>
<s>  now i am secure of you
for ever </s>
<s> 

harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her
forcibly </s>
<s> 

you could not have visited me </s>
<s>  she cried looking aghast </s>
<s>  no to be
sure you could not </s>
<s>  but i never thought of that before </s>
<s>  that would have
been too dreadful </s>
<s> what an escape </s>
<s> dear miss woodhouse i would not
give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing
in the world </s>
<s> 

indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you </s>
<s>  but it
must have been </s>
<s>  you would have thrown yourself out of all good society </s>
<s> 
i must have given you up </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s> how should i ever have borne it </s>
<s>  it would have killed me
never to come to hartfield any more </s>
<s> 

dear affectionate creature </s>
<s> you banished to abbeymill farm </s>
<s> you
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life </s>
<s>  i
wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it </s>
<s>  he must
have a pretty good opinion of himself </s>
<s> 

i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her
conscience opposing such censure </s>
<s>  at least he is very good natured
and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard
forbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know though
he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand certainly i must
confess that since my visiting here i have seen peopleand if one comes
to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all
one is so very handsome and agreeable </s>
<s>  however i do really think <abvr>
martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him </s>
<s>  and
his being so much attached to meand his writing such a letterbut as
to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you my own sweet little friend </s>
<s>  we will not be
parted </s>
<s>  a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or
because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter </s>
<s> 

oh no </s>
<s> and it is but a short letter too </s>
<s> 

emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very
true </s>
<s>  and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish
manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that
her husband could write a good letter </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes very </s>
<s>  nobody cares for a letter </s>
<s>  the thing is to be always
happy with pleasant companions </s>
<s>  i am quite determined to refuse him </s>
<s>  but
how shall i do </s>
<s>  what shall i say </s>
<s> 

emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised
its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her
assistance </s>
<s>  and though emma continued to protest against any assistance
being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence </s>
<s> 
the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a
softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up
with a few decisive expressions </s>
<s>  and she was so very much concerned at
the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother

fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in
her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all </s>
<s> 

this letter however was written and sealed and sent </s>
<s>  the business
was finished and harriet safe </s>
<s>  she was rather low all the evening but
emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by
speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of
mr </s>
<s>  elton </s>
<s> 

i shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather a
sorrowful tone </s>
<s> 

nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet </s>
<s>  you
are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbeymill </s>
<s> 

and i am sure i should never want to go there </s>
<s>  for i am never happy but
at hartfield </s>
<s> 

some time afterwards it was i think <abvr> goddard would be very much
surprized if she knew what had happened </s>
<s>  i am sure miss nash wouldfor
miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a
linendraper </s>
<s> 

one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher
of a school harriet </s>
<s>  i dare say miss nash would envy you such an
opportunity as this of being married </s>
<s>  even this conquest would appear
valuable in her eyes </s>
<s>  as to any thing superior for you i suppose she
is quite in the dark </s>
<s>  the attentions of a certain person can hardly be
among the tittletattle of highbury yet </s>
<s>  hitherto i fancy you and i
are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained
themselves </s>
<s> 

harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that
people should like her so much </s>
<s>  the idea of <abvr> elton was certainly
cheering </s>
<s>  but still after a time she was tenderhearted again towards
the rejected <abvr> martin </s>
<s> 

now he has got my letter said she softly </s>
<s>  i wonder what they are all
doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy they will be unhappy
too </s>
<s>  i hope he will not mind it so very much </s>
<s> 

let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
employed cried emma </s>
<s>  at this moment perhaps <abvr> elton is shewing
your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful

allowing them to hear your name your own dear name </s>

harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger </s>

chapter viii


harriet slept at hartfield that night </s>
<s>  for some weeks past she had been
spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have
a bedroom appropriated to herself </s>
<s>  and emma judged it best in every
respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible
just at present </s>
<s>  she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or
two to <abvr> goddards but it was then to be settled that she should
return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days </s>
<s> 

while she was gone <abvr> knightley called and sat some time with <abvr>
woodhouse and emma till <abvr> woodhouse who had previously made up his
mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was
induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his
own civility to leave <abvr> knightley for that purpose </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley
who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short
decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and
civil hesitations of the other </s>
<s> 

well i believe if you will excuse me <abvr> knightley if you will not
consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emmas advice and
go out for a quarter of an hour </s>
<s>  as the sun is out i believe i had
better take my three turns while i can </s>
<s>  i treat you without ceremony
mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  we invalids think we are privileged people </s>
<s> 

my dear sir do not make a stranger of me </s>
<s> 

i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter </s>
<s>  emma will be happy to
entertain you </s>
<s>  and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my
three turnsmy winter walk </s>
<s> 

you cannot do better sir </s>
<s> 

i would ask for the pleasure of your company <abvr> knightley but i am a
very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you </s>
<s>  and besides you
have another long walk before you to donwell abbey </s>
<s> 

thank you sir thank you </s>
<s>  i am going this moment myself </s>
<s>  and i think
the sooner you go the better </s>
<s>  i will fetch your greatcoat and open the
garden door for you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse at last was off </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley instead of being
immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more
chat </s>
<s>  he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more
voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before </s>
<s> 

i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he </s>
<s>  but she is a
pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her
disposition </s>
<s>  her character depends upon those she is with </s>
<s>  but in good
hands she will turn out a valuable woman </s>
<s> 

i am glad you think so </s>
<s>  and the good hands i hope may not be
wanting </s>
<s> 

come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you
that you have improved her </s>
<s>  you have cured her of her schoolgirls
giggle </s>
<s>  she really does you credit </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been
of some use </s>
<s>  but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they
may </s>
<s>  you do not often overpower me with it </s>
<s> 

you are expecting her again you say this morning </s>
<s> 

almost every moment </s>
<s>  she has been gone longer already than she
intended </s>
<s> 

something has happened to delay her </s>
<s>  some visitors perhaps </s>
<s> 

highbury gossips </s>
<s> tiresome wretches </s>
<s> 

harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would </s>
<s> 

emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said
nothing </s>
<s>  he presently added with a smile

i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that
i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of
something to her advantage </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  how so </s>
<s>  of what sort </s>
<s> 

a very serious sort i assure you </s>
<s>  still smiling </s>
<s> 

very serious </s>
<s>  i can think of but one thingwho is in love with her </s>
<s> 
who makes you their confidant </s>
<s> 

emma was more than half in hopes of <abvr> eltons having dropt a hint </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew <abvr>
elton looked up to him </s>
<s> 

i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have
an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter </s>
<s> robert
martin is the man </s>
<s>  her visit to abbeymill this summer seems to have
done his business </s>
<s>  he is desperately in love and means to marry her </s>
<s> 

he is very obliging said emma </s>
<s>  but is he sure that harriet means to
marry him </s>
<s> 

well well means to make her an offer then </s>
<s>  will that do </s>
<s>  he came to
the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it </s>
<s>  he knows
i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe
considers me as one of his best friends </s>
<s>  he came to ask me whether
i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early </s>
<s>  whether
i thought her too young </s>
<s>  in short whether i approved his choice
altogether </s>
<s>  having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered
especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society
above him </s>
<s>  i was very much pleased with all that he said </s>
<s>  i never hear
better sense from any one than robert martin </s>
<s>  he always speaks to the
purpose </s>
<s>  open straightforward and very well judging </s>
<s>  he told me every
thing </s>
<s>  his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in
the event of his marriage </s>
<s>  he is an excellent young man both as son and
brother </s>
<s>  i had no hesitation in advising him to marry </s>
<s>  he proved to me
that he could afford it </s>
<s>  and that being the case i was convinced he
could not do better </s>
<s>  i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent
him away very happy </s>
<s>  if he had never esteemed my opinion before he
would have thought highly of me then </s>
<s>  and i dare say left the house
thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had </s>
<s>  this happened
the night before last </s>
<s>  now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear
to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at <abvr>
goddards today </s>
<s>  and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking
him at all a tiresome wretch </s>
<s> 

pray <abvr> knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech how do you know that <abvr> martin
did not speak yesterday </s>
<s> 

certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it </s>
<s>  but it
may be inferred </s>
<s>  was not she the whole day with you </s>
<s> 

come said she i will tell you something in return for what
you have told me </s>
<s>  he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote and was
refused </s>
<s> 

this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood
up in tall indignation and said

then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her </s>
<s>  what is the
foolish girl about </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man
that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage </s>
<s>  a man always
imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her </s>
<s> 

nonsense </s>
<s>  a man does not imagine any such thing </s>
<s>  but what is the
meaning of this </s>
<s>  harriet smith refuse robert martin </s>
<s>  madness if it is
so </s>
<s>  but i hope you are mistaken </s>
<s> 

i saw her answer </s>
<s> nothing could be clearer </s>
<s> 

you saw her answer </s>
<s> you wrote her answer too </s>
<s>  emma this is your
doing </s>
<s>  you persuaded her to refuse him </s>
<s> 

and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not
feel that i had done wrong </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin is a very respectable young man
but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal </s>
<s>  and am rather surprized
indeed that he should have ventured to address her </s>
<s>  by your account he
does seem to have had some scruples </s>
<s>  it is a pity that they were ever
got over </s>
<s> 

not harriets equal </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> knightley loudly and warmly </s>
<s>  and
with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is
not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in
situation </s>
<s>  emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you </s>
<s>  what are
harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education to any
connexion higher than robert martin </s>
<s>  she is the natural daughter of
nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and
certainly no respectable relations </s>
<s>  she is known only as parlourboarder
at a common school </s>
<s>  she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any
information </s>
<s>  she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and
too simple to have acquired any thing herself </s>
<s>  at her age she can have
no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have
any that can avail her </s>
<s>  she is pretty and she is good tempered and
that is all </s>
<s>  my only scruple in advising the match was on his account
as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him </s>
<s>  i felt that
as to fortune in all probability he might do much better </s>
<s>  and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse </s>
<s>  but i
could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there
being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in
good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well </s>
<s> 
the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side </s>
<s>  and had not the
smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cryout
upon her extreme good luck </s>
<s>  even your satisfaction i made sure of </s>
<s> 
it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friends
leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well </s>
<s>  i remember
saying to myself òeven emma with all her partiality for harriet will
think this a good match </s>
<s> 

i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any
such thing </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s>  think a farmer and with all his sense and all his
merit <abvr> martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend </s>
<s> 
not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom
i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own </s>
<s>  i wonder you should
think it possible for me to have such feelings </s>
<s>  i assure you mine are
very different </s>
<s>  i must think your statement by no means fair </s>
<s>  you are
not just to harriets claims </s>
<s>  they would be estimated very differently
by others as well as myself </s>
<s>  <abvr> martin may be the richest of the two
but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society </s>
<s> the sphere in
which she moves is much above his </s>
<s> it would be a degradation </s>
<s> 

a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a
respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer </s>
<s> 

as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may
be called nobody it will not hold in common sense </s>
<s>  she is not to pay
for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with
whom she is brought up </s>
<s> there can scarcely be a doubt that her father
is a gentlemanand a gentleman of fortune </s>
<s> her allowance is
very liberal </s>
<s>  nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or
comfort </s>
<s> that she is a gentlemans daughter is indubitable to me </s>
<s>  that
she associates with gentlemens daughters no one i apprehend will
deny </s>
<s> she is superior to <abvr> robert martin </s>
<s> 

whoever might be her parents said <abvr> knightley whoever may have
had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of
their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society </s>
<s>  after
receiving a very indifferent education she is left in <abvr> goddards
hands to shift as she can </s>
<s> to move in short in <abvr> goddards line
to have <abvr> goddards acquaintance </s>
<s>  her friends evidently thought
this good enough for her </s>
<s>  and it was good enough </s>
<s>  she desired nothing
better herself </s>
<s>  till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had
no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it </s>
<s>  she was as
happy as possible with the martins in the summer </s>
<s>  she had no sense of
superiority then </s>
<s>  if she has it now you have given it </s>
<s>  you have been no
friend to harriet smith emma </s>
<s>  robert martin would never have proceeded
so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to
him </s>
<s>  i know him well </s>
<s>  he has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion </s>
<s>  and as to conceit he is
the farthest from it of any man i know </s>
<s>  depend upon it he had
encouragement </s>
<s> 

it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion </s>
<s>  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject
again </s>
<s> 

you are a very warm friend to <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  but as i said before
are unjust to harriet </s>
<s>  harriets claims to marry well are not so
contemptible as you represent them </s>
<s>  she is not a clever girl but she
has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her
understanding spoken of so slightingly </s>
<s>  waiving that point however and
supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and goodnatured
let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not
trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a
beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an
hundred </s>
<s>  and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the
subject of beauty than they are generally supposed </s>
<s>  till they do fall
in love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with
such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought
after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a
claim to be nice </s>
<s>  her goodnature too is not so very slight a claim
comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and
manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to
be pleased with other people </s>
<s>  i am very much mistaken if your sex in
general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims
a woman could possess </s>
<s> 

upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost
enough to make me think so too </s>
<s>  better be without sense than misapply
it as you do </s>
<s> 

to be sure </s>
<s>  cried she playfully </s>
<s>  i know that is the feeling of
you all </s>
<s>  i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every
man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his
judgment </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  harriet may pick and chuse </s>
<s>  were you yourself ever to
marry she is the very woman for you </s>
<s>  and is she at seventeen just
entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at
because she does not accept the first offer she receives </s>
<s>  nopray let
her have time to look about her </s>
<s> 

i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said <abvr> knightley
presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself </s>
<s>  but i now perceive
that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet </s>
<s>  you will puff her up
with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that
in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her </s>
<s> 
vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief </s>
<s>  nothing
so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high </s>
<s>  miss
harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though
she is a very pretty girl </s>
<s>  men of sense whatever you may chuse to
say do not want silly wives </s>
<s>  men of family would not be very fond of
connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent
men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be
involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed </s>
<s>  let
her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for
ever </s>
<s>  but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her
to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large
fortune she may be a parlourboarder at <abvr> goddards all the rest
of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry
somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the
old writingmasters son </s>
<s> 

we think so very differently on this point <abvr> knightley that there
can be no use in canvassing it </s>
<s>  we shall only be making each other more
angry </s>
<s>  but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible </s>
<s> 
she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any
second application </s>
<s>  she must abide by the evil of having refused him
whatever it may be </s>
<s>  and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to
say that i might not influence her a little </s>
<s>  but i assure you there
was very little for me or for any body to do </s>
<s>  his appearance is so much
against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to
favour him she is not now </s>
<s>  i can imagine that before she had seen
any body superior she might tolerate him </s>
<s>  he was the brother of her
friends and he took pains to please her </s>
<s>  and altogether having seen
nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not
while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable </s>
<s>  but the case
is altered now </s>
<s>  she knows now what gentlemen are </s>
<s>  and nothing but a
gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet </s>
<s> 

nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked </s>
<s>  cried <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> robert martins manners have sense sincerity and
goodhumour to recommend them </s>
<s>  and his mind has more true gentility than
harriet smith could understand </s>
<s> 

emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone </s>
<s>  she
did not repent what she had done </s>
<s>  she still thought herself a better
judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be </s>
<s> 
but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general
which made her dislike having it so loudly against her </s>
<s>  and to have him
sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable </s>
<s> 
some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt
on emmas side to talk of the weather but he made no answer </s>
<s>  he was
thinking </s>
<s>  the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words </s>
<s> 

robert martin has no great lossif he can but think so </s>
<s>  and i hope it
will not be long before he does </s>
<s>  your views for harriet are best known
to yourself </s>
<s>  but as you make no secret of your love of matchmaking it
is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have </s>
<s> and as
a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it
will be all labour in vain </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and disclaimed </s>
<s>  he continued

depend upon it elton will not do </s>
<s>  elton is a very good sort of man
and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make
an imprudent match </s>
<s>  he knows the value of a good income as well as any
body </s>
<s>  elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally </s>
<s>  he is
as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriets </s>
<s> 
he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite
wherever he goes </s>
<s>  and from his general way of talking in unreserved
moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does
not mean to throw himself away </s>
<s>  i have heard him speak with great
animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are
intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece </s>
<s> 

i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again </s>
<s>  if i had
set my heart on <abvr> eltons marrying harriet it would have been very
kind to open my eyes </s>
<s>  but at present i only want to keep harriet to
myself </s>
<s>  i have done with matchmaking indeed </s>
<s>  i could never hope to
equal my own doings at randalls </s>
<s>  i shall leave off while i am well </s>
<s> 

good morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly </s>
<s>  he was
very much vexed </s>
<s>  he felt the disappointment of the young man and was
mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had
given </s>
<s>  and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair
was provoking him exceedingly </s>
<s> 

emma remained in a state of vexation too </s>
<s>  but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of hers than in his </s>
<s>  she did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that
her opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he
walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her </s>
<s>  she
was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and
the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives </s>
<s>  harriets staying
away so long was beginning to make her uneasy </s>
<s>  the possibility of the
young mans coming to <abvr> goddards that morning and meeting with
harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas </s>
<s>  the dread
of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness </s>
<s>  and when
harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any
such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which
settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let <abvr>
knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which womans
friendship and womans feelings would not justify </s>
<s> 

he had frightened her a little about <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  but when she considered
that <abvr> knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither
with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such
a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she
was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully
to be true than what he knew any thing about </s>
<s>  he certainly might have
heard <abvr> elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and
mr </s>
<s>  elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to
money matters </s>
<s>  he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise
to them </s>
<s>  but then <abvr> knightley did not make due allowance for the
influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its
effects </s>
<s>  but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming
any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest </s>
<s>  and
more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure
did not belong to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

harriets cheerful look and manner established hers </s>
<s>  she came back not
to think of <abvr> martin but to talk of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  miss nash had been
telling her something which she repeated immediately with great
delight </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry had been to <abvr> goddards to attend a sick child
and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was
coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met <abvr> elton and
found to his great surprize that <abvr> elton was actually on his road
to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the
whistclub night which he had been never known to miss before </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it
was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to
persuade him to put off his journey only one day </s>
<s>  but it would not
do </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very
particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would
not put off for any inducement in the world </s>
<s>  and something about a
very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly
precious </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure
there must be a lady in the case and he told him so </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton
only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits </s>
<s> 
miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about
mr </s>
<s>  elton </s>
<s>  and said looking so very significantly at her that she did
not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only
knew that any woman whom <abvr> elton could prefer she should think the
luckiest woman in the world </s>
<s>  for beyond a doubt <abvr> elton had not his
equal for beauty or agreeableness </s>

chapter ix


mr </s>

herself </s>

shewed that she was not forgiven </s>

on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified

the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after <abvr>

visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as
her youth and sort of mind admitted </s>
<s>  emma was soon perfectly satisfied
of <abvr> martins being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a
contrast with <abvr> elton of the utmost advantage to the latter </s>
<s> 

her views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal of
useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few
first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow </s>
<s>  it was much
easier to chat than to study </s>
<s>  much pleasanter to let her imagination
range and work at harriets fortune than to be labouring to enlarge
her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts </s>
<s>  and the only literary
pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she
was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing
all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin
quarto of hotpressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with
ciphers and trophies </s>

in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are
not uncommon </s>

at least three hundred </s>

from her hoped with miss woodhouses help to get a great many more </s>
<s> 
emma assisted with her invention memory and taste </s>
<s>  and as harriet wrote
a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first
order in form as well as quantity </s>

mr </s>

girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting
in </s>
<s>  so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe
wondered he could not remember them </s>

<s> 
 and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid </s>
<s> 

his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind </s>
<s>  but he
had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much
something he thought might come from that quarter </s>
<s> 

it was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of highbury
in general should be put under requisition </s>

whose assistance she asked </s>

enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect </s>

the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections </s>

and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that
nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the
sex should pass his lips </s>
<s>  they owed to him their two or three politest
puzzles </s>

rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade

pages ago already </s>

the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration </s>

called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table
containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed
to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his
manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own </s>
<s> 

i do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he </s>

friends i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye

the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could
understand </s>

it easier to meet her eye than her friends </s>

she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through

harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and
dulness very well <abvr> elton very well indeed </s>

she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations

eagerness of harriets wondering questions </s>

a very proper compliment </s>

harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion </s>

<s>  <abvr> eltons superiority had very ample acknowledgment </s>

whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i
suppose and believe and hope it must be so </s>

place </s>

when miss smiths and <abvr> eltons get acquaintedthey do indeedand
really it is strange </s>

evidently so palpably desirablewhat courts the prearrangement of
other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form </s>
<s> 
you and <abvr> elton are by situation called together </s>
<s>  you belong to one
another by every circumstance of your respective homes </s>
<s>  your marrying
will be equal to the match at randalls </s>
<s>  there does seem to be a
something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right
direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow </s>
<s> 

      the course of true love never did run smooth

a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that
passage </s>
<s> 

that <abvr> elton should really be in love with meme of all people
who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas </s>
<s>  and he the very
handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to
quite like <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  his company so sought after that every body
says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it </s>

that he has more invitations than there are days in the week </s>

excellent in the church </s>

ever preached from since he came to highbury </s>

to the first time i saw him </s>
<s>  how little did i think </s>
<s> the two abbots and
i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he
was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look
through herself </s>

look too which was very goodnatured </s>

looked </s>

this is an alliance which whoeverwhatever your friends may be must
be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense </s>

are not to be addressing our conduct to fools </s>

see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives
every assurance of it </s>

country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will
be accomplished </s>

them </s>
<s> 

yes very true </s>
<s>  how nicely you talk </s>
<s>  i love to hear you </s>

every thing </s>
<s>  you and <abvr> elton are one as clever as the other </s>
<s>  this
charade </s>
<s> if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any
thing like it </s>
<s> 

i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it
yesterday </s>
<s> 

i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read </s>
<s> 

i never read one more to the purpose certainly </s>
<s> 

it is as long again as almost all we have had before </s>
<s> 

i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour </s>
<s>  such things
in general cannot be too short </s>
<s> 

harriet was too intent on the lines to hear </s>
<s>  the most satisfactory
comparisons were rising in her mind </s>
<s> 

it is one thing said she presentlyher cheeks in a glowto have
very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is
any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you
must in a short way </s>
<s>  and another to write verses and charades like
this </s>
<s> 

emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of <abvr> martins
prose </s>
<s> 

such sweet lines </s>
<s>  continued harrietthese two last </s>
<s> but how shall i
ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss
woodhouse what can we do about that </s>
<s> 

leave it to me </s>
<s>  you do nothing </s>

<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful
charade into my book </s>
<s>  i am sure i have not got one half so good </s>
<s> 

leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not
write it into your book </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but those two lines are

the best of all </s>
<s>  granted </s>
<s> for private enjoyment </s>
<s>  and for private
enjoyment keep them </s>
<s>  they are not at all the less written you know
because you divide them </s>
<s>  the couplet does not cease to be nor does its
meaning change </s>
<s>  but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a
very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection </s>

it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his
passion </s>
<s>  a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or
neither </s>
<s>  give me the book i will write it down and then there can be
no possible reflection on you </s>
<s> 

harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a
declaration of love </s>
<s>  it seemed too precious an offering for any degree
of publicity </s>
<s> 

i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she </s>
<s> 

very well replied emma </s>
<s>  a most natural feeling </s>
<s>  and the longer it
lasts the better i shall be pleased </s>
<s>  but here is my father coming </s>
<s>  you
will not object to my reading the charade to him </s>
<s>  it will be giving him
so much pleasure </s>
<s>  he loves any thing of the sort and especially any
thing that pays woman a compliment </s>
<s>  he has the tenderest spirit of
gallantry towards us all </s>
<s> you must let me read it to him </s>
<s> 

harriet looked grave </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade </s>
<s> you
will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too
quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning
which may be affixed to it </s>
<s>  do not be overpowered by such a little
tribute of admiration </s>
<s>  if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not
have left the paper while i was by </s>
<s>  but he rather pushed it towards me
than towards you </s>
<s>  do not let us be too solemn on the business </s>
<s>  he has
encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over
this charade </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  noi hope i shall not be ridiculous about it </s>
<s>  do as you please </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the
recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does
your book go on </s>
<s> have you got any thing fresh </s>
<s> 

yes papa </s>
<s>  we have something to read you something quite fresh </s>
<s>  a
piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt we suppose
by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we have just copied
it in </s>
<s> 

she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and
distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every
part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and as she had
foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion </s>
<s> 

aye thats very just indeed thats very properly said </s>
<s>  very true </s>
<s> 
òwoman lovely woman </s>
<s>  it is such a pretty charade my dear that i
can easily guess what fairy brought it </s>
<s> nobody could have written so
prettily but you emma </s>
<s> 

emma only nodded and smiled </s>
<s> after a little thinking and a very
tender sigh he added

ah </s>
<s>  it is no difficulty to see who you take after </s>
<s>  your dear mother
was so clever at all those things </s>
<s>  if i had but her memory </s>
<s>  but i can
remember nothing </s>
<s> not even that particular riddle which you have
heard me mention </s>

<s>  and there are
several </s>
<s>

    the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid
    though of his near approach afraid
      so fatal to my suit before </s>
<s> 

and that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever all
the way through </s>
<s>  but i think my dear you said you had got it </s>
<s> 

yes papa it is written out in our second page </s>
<s>  we copied it from the
elegant extracts </s>
<s>  it was garricks you know </s>
<s> 

aye very true </s>
<s> i wish i could recollect more of it </s>
<s> 

    kitty a fair but frozen maid </s>

christened catherine after her grandmama </s>

room there will be for the children </s>

<s> 

she will not be surprized papa at least </s>
<s> 

i do not know my dear </s>
<s>  i am sure i was very much surprized when i

<s> 

we must ask <abvr> and <abvr> weston to dine with us while isabella is
here </s>
<s> 

yes my dear if there is time </s>

christmasthough you know it is longer since they were with him than
with us </s>
<s> 

it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be
anywhere but at hartfield </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse could never allow for <abvr> knightleys claims on his
brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own </s>
<s>  he sat musing
a little while and then said

but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so
soon though he does </s>
<s>  i think emma i shall try and persuade her to
stay longer with us </s>
<s>  she and the children might stay very well </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish and i
do not think you ever will </s>
<s>  isabella cannot bear to stay behind her
husband </s>
<s> 

this was too true for contradiction </s>
<s>  unwelcome as it was <abvr> woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh </s>
<s>  and as emma saw his spirits affected
by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband she immediately
led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them </s>
<s> 

harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother
and sister are here </s>
<s>  i am sure she will be pleased with the children </s>
<s> 
we are very proud of the children are not we papa </s>

thought very pretty of her </s>

<s>  they
are all remarkably clever </s>
<s>  and they have so many pretty ways </s>
<s>  they will
come and stand by my chair and say ògrandpapa can you give me a bit
of string </s>
<s>  and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives
were only made for grandpapas </s>
<s>  i think their father is too rough with
them very often </s>
<s> 

he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle
yourself </s>
<s>  but if you could compare him with other papas you would not
think him rough </s>
<s>  he wishes his boys to be active and hardy </s>
<s>  and if
they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then </s>
<s>  but he is an
affectionate fathercertainly <abvr> john knightley is an affectionate
father </s>

<s> 

and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a
very frightful way </s>
<s> 

but they like it papa </s>
<s>  there is nothing they like so much </s>
<s>  it is such
enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of
their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other </s>

well i cannot understand it </s>

that is the case with us all papa </s>
<s>  one half of the world cannot

later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero of this
inimitable charade walked in again </s>
<s>  harriet turned away </s>
<s>  but emma could
receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in
his the consciousness of having made a pushof having thrown a die </s>
<s> 
and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up </s>

reason however was to ask whether <abvr> woodhouses party could be made
up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest
degree necessary at hartfield </s>
<s>  if he were every thing else must give
way </s>
<s>  but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his
dining with himhad made such a point of it that he had promised him
conditionally to come </s>
<s> 

emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend
on their account </s>
<s>  her father was sure of his rubber </s>
<s>  he reurgedshe
redeclined </s>
<s>  and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the
paper from the table she returned it

oh </s>
<s>  here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us </s>

you for the sight of it </s>
<s>  we admired it so much that i have ventured

lines </s>

emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took
it up and examined it very attentively </s>

awkward moment emma smilingly said

i have no hesitation in saying replied <abvr> elton though hesitating
a good deal while he spoke </s>

book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the
proudest moment of his life </s>
<s> 

after this speech he was gone as soon as possible </s>
<s>  emma could not think
it too soon </s>
<s>  for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was

chapter x


though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to
prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise </s>
<s>  and on the
morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who
lived a little way out of highbury </s>
<s> 

their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane
leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of
the place </s>
<s>  and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about
a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not
very good house almost as close to the road as it could be </s>
<s>  it had
no advantage of situation </s>
<s>  but had been very much smartened up by the
present proprietor </s>
<s>  and such as it was there could be no possibility
of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing
eyes </s>
<s> emmas remark was

there it is </s>
<s>  there go you and your riddlebook one of these
days </s>
<s> harriets was

oh what a sweet house </s>
<s> how very beautiful </s>
<s> there are the yellow
curtains that miss nash admires so much </s>
<s> 

i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but
then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately
acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part
of highbury </s>
<s> 

harriet she found had never in her life been inside the vicarage
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors
and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with
mr </s>
<s>  eltons seeing ready wit in her </s>
<s> 

i wish we could contrive it said she </s>
<s>  but i cannot think of any
tolerable pretence for going in </s>
<s> no servant that i want to inquire
about of his housekeeperno message from my father </s>
<s> 

she pondered but could think of nothing </s>
<s>  after a mutual silence of some
minutes harriet thus began again

i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or
going to be married </s>
<s>  so charming as you are </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and replied

my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry </s>
<s> 
i must find other people charmingone other person at least </s>
<s>  and i
am not only not going to be married at present but have very little
intention of ever marrying at all </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> so you say </s>
<s>  but i cannot believe it </s>
<s> 

i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be
tempted </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton you know recollecting herself is out of the
question </s>
<s>  and i do not wish to see any such person </s>
<s>  i would rather not
be tempted </s>
<s>  i cannot really change for the better </s>
<s>  if i were to marry i
must expect to repent it </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s> it is so odd to hear a woman talk so </s>
<s> 

i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry </s>
<s>  were i to fall
in love indeed it would be a different thing </s>
<s>  but i never have been in
love </s>
<s>  it is not my way or my nature </s>
<s>  and i do not think i ever shall </s>
<s> 
and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a
situation as mine </s>
<s>  fortune i do not want </s>
<s>  employment i do not want </s>
<s> 
consequence i do not want </s>
<s>  i believe few married women are half as much
mistress of their husbands house as i am of hartfield </s>
<s>  and never never
could i expect to be so truly beloved and important </s>
<s>  so always first and
always right in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers </s>
<s> 

but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates </s>
<s> 

that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet </s>
<s>  and if
i thought i should ever be like miss bates </s>
<s>  so sillyso satisfiedso
smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidiousand so apt
to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry
tomorrow </s>
<s>  but between us i am convinced there never can be any
likeness except in being unmarried </s>
<s> 

but still you will be an old maid </s>
<s>  and thats so dreadful </s>
<s> 

never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid </s>
<s>  and it is poverty
only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public </s>
<s>  a single
woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old
maid </s>
<s>  the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good
fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant
as any body else </s>
<s>  and the distinction is not quite so much against the
candour and common sense of the world as appears at first </s>
<s>  for a very
narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper </s>
<s> 
those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and
generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross </s>
<s>  this
does not apply however to miss bates </s>
<s>  she is only too good natured and
too silly to suit me </s>
<s>  but in general she is very much to the taste
of every body though single and though poor </s>
<s>  poverty certainly has not
contracted her mind </s>
<s>  i really believe if she had only a shilling in the
world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it </s>
<s>  and nobody
is afraid of her </s>
<s>  that is a great charm </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  but what shall you do </s>
<s>  how shall you employ yourself when you
grow old </s>
<s> 

if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great
many independent resources </s>
<s>  and i do not perceive why i should be more
in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty </s>
<s>  womans
usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they
are now </s>
<s>  or with no important variation </s>
<s>  if i draw less i shall read
more </s>
<s>  if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork </s>
<s>  and as for
objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the
great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil
to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the
children of a sister i love so much to care about </s>
<s>  there will be enough
of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that
declining life can need </s>
<s>  there will be enough for every hope and every
fear </s>
<s>  and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it
suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder </s>
<s>  my
nephews and nieces </s>
<s> i shall often have a niece with me </s>
<s> 

do you know miss batess niece </s>
<s>  that is i know you must have seen her
a hundred timesbut are you acquainted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to
highbury </s>
<s>  by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit
with a niece </s>
<s>  heaven forbid </s>
<s>  at least that i should ever bore people
half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane
fairfax </s>
<s>  one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  every letter from
her is read forty times over </s>
<s>  her compliments to all friends go round
and round again </s>
<s>  and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a
stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of
nothing else for a month </s>
<s>  i wish jane fairfax very well </s>
<s>  but she tires
me to death </s>
<s> 

they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were
superseded </s>
<s>  emma was very compassionate </s>
<s>  and the distresses of the poor
were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her
counsel and her patience as from her purse </s>
<s>  she understood their ways
could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic
expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had
done so little </s>
<s>  entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and
always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as goodwill </s>
<s>  in
the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she
came to visit </s>
<s>  and after remaining there as long as she could give
comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of
the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away

these are the sights harriet to do one good </s>
<s>  how trifling they make
every thing else appear </s>
<s> i feel now as if i could think of nothing but
these poor creatures all the rest of the day </s>
<s>  and yet who can say how
soon it may all vanish from my mind </s>
<s> 

very true said harriet </s>
<s>  poor creatures </s>
<s>  one can think of nothing
else </s>
<s> 

and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said
emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended
the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them
into the lane again </s>
<s>  i do not think it will stopping to look once
more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still
greater within </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear no said her companion </s>
<s> 

they walked on </s>
<s>  the lane made a slight bend </s>
<s>  and when that bend was
passed <abvr> elton was immediately in sight </s>
<s>  and so near as to give emma
time only to say farther

ah </s>
<s>  harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good
thoughts </s>
<s>  well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion
has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that
is truly important </s>
<s>  if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can
for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves </s>
<s> 

harriet could just answer oh </s>
<s>  dear yes before the gentleman joined
them </s>
<s>  the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the
first subject on meeting </s>
<s>  he had been going to call on them </s>
<s>  his visit
he would now defer </s>
<s>  but they had a very interesting parley about
what could be done and should be done </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton then turned back to
accompany them </s>
<s> 

to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma </s>
<s> 
to meet in a charitable scheme </s>
<s>  this will bring a great increase
of love on each side </s>
<s>  i should not wonder if it were to bring on the
declaration </s>
<s>  it must if i were not here </s>
<s>  i wish i were anywhere else </s>
<s> 

anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one
side of the lane leaving them together in the main road </s>
<s>  but she had
not been there two minutes when she found that harriets habits of
dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short
they would both be soon after her </s>
<s>  this would not do </s>
<s>  she immediately
stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing
of her halfboot and stooping down in complete occupation of the
footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would
follow in half a minute </s>
<s>  they did as they were desired </s>
<s>  and by the time
she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort
of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the
cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch
broth from hartfield </s>
<s>  to walk by the side of this child and talk to
and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have
been the most natural had she been acting just then without design </s>
<s> 
and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without
any obligation of waiting for her </s>
<s>  she gained on them however
involuntarily </s>
<s>  the childs pace was quick and theirs rather slow </s>
<s> 
and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in
a conversation which interested them </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was speaking with
animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention </s>
<s>  and emma
having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back
a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail </s>
<s> 
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only
giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays party at his
friend coles and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese
the north wiltshire the butter the celery the beetroot and all the
dessert </s>
<s> 

this would soon have led to something better of course was her
consoling reflection </s>
<s>  any thing interests between those who love </s>
<s>  and
any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart </s>
<s>  if i
could but have kept longer away </s>
<s> 

they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage
pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the
house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and
fall behind to arrange it once more </s>
<s>  she then broke the lace off short
and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to
entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to
rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort </s>
<s> 

part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to
contrive </s>
<s>  i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i
hope i am not often so illequipped </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton i must beg leave to stop
at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string
or any thing just to keep my boot on </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton looked all happiness at this proposition </s>
<s>  and nothing could
exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and
endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage </s>
<s>  the room they were
taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards </s>
<s>  behind
it was another with which it immediately communicated </s>
<s>  the door between
them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive
her assistance in the most comfortable manner </s>
<s>  she was obliged to leave
the door ajar as she found it </s>
<s>  but she fully intended that <abvr> elton
should close it </s>
<s>  it was not closed however it still remained ajar </s>
<s>  but
by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make
it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining
room </s>
<s>  for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself </s>
<s>  it could be
protracted no longer </s>
<s>  she was then obliged to be finished and make her
appearance </s>
<s> 

the lovers were standing together at one of the windows </s>
<s>  it had a most
favourable aspect </s>
<s>  and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having
schemed successfully </s>
<s>  but it would not do </s>
<s>  he had not come to the point </s>
<s> 
he had been most agreeable most delightful </s>
<s>  he had told harriet that
he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them </s>
<s>  other little
gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious </s>
<s> 

cautious very cautious thought emma </s>
<s>  he advances inch by inch and
will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure </s>
<s> 

still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her
ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been
the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them
forward to the great event </s>
<s> 



chapter xi


mr </s>
<s>  elton must now be left to himself </s>
<s>  it was no longer in emmas power
to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures </s>
<s>  the coming of her
sisters family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation
and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest </s>
<s> 
and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be
expectedshe did not herself expectthat any thing beyond occasional
fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers </s>
<s>  they might
advance rapidly if they would however </s>
<s>  they must advance somehow or
other whether they would or no </s>
<s>  she hardly wished to have more leisure
for them </s>
<s>  there are people who the more you do for them the less they
will do for themselves </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> john knightley from having been longer than usual absent
from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest </s>
<s> 
till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been
divided between hartfield and donwell abbey </s>
<s>  but all the holidays of
this autumn had been given to seabathing for the children and it was
therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their
surry connexions or seen at all by <abvr> woodhouse who could not be
induced to get so far as london even for poor isabellas sake </s>
<s>  and
who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in
forestalling this too short visit </s>
<s> 

he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little
of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some
of the party the last half of the way </s>
<s>  but his alarms were needless </s>
<s> 
the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and <abvr> and <abvr> john
knightley their five children and a competent number of nurserymaids
all reaching hartfield in safety </s>
<s>  the bustle and joy of such an arrival
the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed
and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could
not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even
for this </s>
<s>  but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father
were so respected by <abvr> john knightley that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their
having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and
drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for
without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long
a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance
on them </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet
manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate </s>
<s>  wrapt
up in her family </s>
<s>  a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly
attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a
warmer love might have seemed impossible </s>
<s>  she could never see a fault
in any of them </s>
<s>  she was not a woman of strong understanding or any
quickness </s>
<s>  and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also
much of his constitution </s>
<s>  was delicate in her own health overcareful
of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond
of her own <abvr> wingfield in town as her father could be of <abvr> perry </s>
<s> 
they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong
habit of regard for every old acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man </s>
<s> 
rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private
character </s>
<s>  but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally
pleasing </s>
<s>  and capable of being sometimes out of humour </s>
<s>  he was not an
illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a
reproach </s>
<s>  but his temper was not his great perfection </s>
<s>  and indeed with
such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects
in it should not be increased </s>
<s>  the extreme sweetness of her temper
must hurt his </s>
<s>  he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she
wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing </s>
<s> 

he was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw </s>
<s>  nothing wrong
in him escaped her </s>
<s>  she was quick in feeling the little injuries to
isabella which isabella never felt herself </s>
<s>  perhaps she might have
passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellas sister
but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without
praise and without blindness </s>
<s>  but hardly any degree of personal
compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of
all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful
forbearance towards her father </s>
<s>  there he had not always the patience
that could have been wished </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouses peculiarities and
fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or
sharp retort equally illbestowed </s>
<s>  it did not often happen </s>
<s>  for <abvr> john
knightley had really a great regard for his fatherinlaw and generally
a strong sense of what was due to him </s>
<s>  but it was too often for emmas
charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently
to be endured though the offence came not </s>
<s>  the beginning however of
every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of
necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality </s>
<s> 
they had not been long seated and composed when <abvr> woodhouse with a
melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters attention
to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last </s>
<s> 

ah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business </s>
<s> 

oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her </s>
<s> 
and dear emma too </s>
<s> what a dreadful loss to you both </s>
<s> i have been so
grieved for you </s>
<s> i could not imagine how you could possibly do without
her </s>
<s> it is a sad change indeed </s>
<s> but i hope she is pretty well sir </s>
<s> 

pretty well my deari hopepretty well </s>
<s> i do not know but that the
place agrees with her tolerably </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts
of the air of randalls </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nonone in the least </s>
<s>  i never saw <abvr> weston better in my
lifenever looking so well </s>
<s>  papa is only speaking his own regret </s>
<s> 

very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply </s>
<s> 

and do you see her sir tolerably often </s>
<s>  asked isabella in the
plaintive tone which just suited her father </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse hesitated </s>
<s> not near so often my dear as i could wish </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they
married </s>
<s>  either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one
have we seen either <abvr> weston or <abvr> weston and generally both
either at randalls or hereand as you may suppose isabella most
frequently here </s>
<s>  they are very very kind in their visits </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
is really as kind as herself </s>
<s>  papa if you speak in that melancholy way
you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all </s>
<s>  every body must be
aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be
assured that <abvr> and <abvr> weston do really prevent our missing her by
any means to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact
truth </s>
<s> 

just as it should be said <abvr> john knightley and just as i hoped
it was from your letters </s>
<s>  her wish of shewing you attention could not be
doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy </s>
<s>  i
have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change
being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended </s>
<s>  and now you have
emmas account i hope you will be satisfied </s>
<s> 

why to be sure said <abvr> woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot
deny that <abvr> weston poor <abvr> weston does come and see us pretty
oftenbut thenshe is always obliged to go away again </s>
<s> 

it would be very hard upon <abvr> weston if she did not papa </s>
<s> you quite
forget poor <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that <abvr> weston has
some little claim </s>
<s>  you and i emma will venture to take the part of the
poor husband </s>
<s>  i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims
of the man may very likely strike us with equal force </s>
<s>  as for isabella
she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all
the <abvr> westons aside as much as she can </s>
<s> 

me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part </s>
<s> 
are you talking about me </s>
<s> i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a
greater advocate for matrimony than i am </s>
<s>  and if it had not been for
the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss
taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world </s>
<s>  and as to slighting
mr </s>
<s>  weston that excellent <abvr> weston i think there is nothing he does
not deserve </s>
<s>  i believe he is one of the very besttempered men that ever
existed </s>
<s>  excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal
for temper </s>
<s>  i shall never forget his flying henrys kite for him that
very windy day last easterand ever since his particular kindness last
september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i
have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better
man in existence </s>
<s> if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor </s>
<s> 

where is the young man </s>
<s>  said john knightley </s>
<s>  has he been here on this
occasionor has he not </s>
<s> 

he has not been here yet replied emma </s>
<s>  there was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in
nothing </s>
<s>  and i have not heard him mentioned lately </s>
<s> 

but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father </s>
<s> 
he wrote a letter to poor <abvr> weston to congratulate her and a very
proper handsome letter it was </s>
<s>  she shewed it to me </s>
<s>  i thought it very
well done of him indeed </s>
<s>  whether it was his own idea you know one
cannot tell </s>
<s>  he is but young and his uncle perhaps

my dear papa he is threeandtwenty </s>
<s>  you forget how time passes </s>
<s> 

threeandtwenty </s>
<s> is he indeed </s>
<s> well i could not have thought
itand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother </s>
<s>  well
time does fly indeed </s>
<s> and my memory is very bad </s>
<s>  however it was an
exceeding good pretty letter and gave <abvr> and <abvr> weston a great deal
of pleasure </s>
<s>  i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept </s>
<s> 
thand began òmy dear madam but i forget how it went on </s>
<s>  and it
was signed òf </s>
<s>  c </s>
<s>  weston churchill </s>
<s> i remember that perfectly </s>
<s> 

how very pleasing and proper of him </s>
<s>  cried the goodhearted <abvr> john
knightley </s>
<s>  i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man </s>
<s>  but
how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father </s>
<s>  there is
something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his parents and
natural home </s>
<s>  i never could comprehend how <abvr> weston could part with
him </s>
<s>  to give up ones child </s>
<s>  i really never could think well of any body
who proposed such a thing to any body else </s>
<s> 

nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed <abvr>
john knightley coolly </s>
<s>  but you need not imagine <abvr> weston to have felt
what you would feel in giving up henry or john </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston is rather
an easy cheerfultempered man than a man of strong feelings </s>
<s>  he takes
things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other
depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his
comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing
whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection
or any thing that home affords </s>
<s> 

emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on <abvr> weston and had
half a mind to take it up </s>
<s>  but she struggled and let it pass </s>
<s>  she
would keep the peace if possible </s>
<s>  and there was something honourable and
valuable in the strong domestic habits the allsufficiency of home to
himself whence resulted her brothers disposition to look down on
the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was
important </s>
<s> it had a high claim to forbearance </s>

mr </s>

isabellas first day </s>

and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had
particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement
between <abvr> knightley and herself in procuring him the proper
invitation </s>

she hoped they might now become friends again </s>

was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced
about in her aunts arms </s>
<s>  it did assist </s>
<s>  for though he began with grave
looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in
the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the
unceremoniousness of perfect amity </s>
<s>  emma felt they were friends again </s>
<s> 
and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then
a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the
baby

what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces </s>
<s> 
as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different </s>
<s>  but with
regard to these children i observe we never disagree </s>
<s> 

if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women
and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with
them as you are where these children are concerned we might always
think alike </s>
<s> 

to be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being in the
wrong </s>

yes said he smilingand reason good </s>

you were born </s>

a material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were much
my superior in judgment at that period of our lives </s>

lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings a good deal
nearer </s>

yesa good deal nearer </s>
<s> 

but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we
think differently </s>

i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child </s>
<s>  come my dear emma
let us be friends and say no more about it </s>
<s>  tell your aunt little
emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old
grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now </s>

thats true she criedvery true </s>

woman than your aunt </s>

<s> 
now <abvr> knightley a word or two more and i have done </s>
<s>  as far as good
intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on
my side of the argument have yet proved wrong </s>
<s>  i only want to know that
mr </s>
<s>  martin is not very very bitterly disappointed </s>
<s> 

a man cannot be more so was his short full answer </s>
<s> 

ah </s>

<s> come shake hands with me </s>
<s> 

this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley
made his appearance and how dye do george </s>

you </s>
<s>  succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that
seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led
either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the
other </s>
<s> 

the evening was quiet and conversable as <abvr> woodhouse declined cards
entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and
the little party made two natural divisions </s>
<s>  on one side he and his
daughter </s>
<s>  on the other the two <abvr> knightleys </s>
<s>  their subjects totally
distinct or very rarely mixingand emma only occasionally joining in
one or the other </s>
<s> 

the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally
of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative
and who was always the greater talker </s>
<s>  as a magistrate he had generally
some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious
anecdote to give </s>
<s>  and as a farmer as keeping in hand the homefarm at
donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to
give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting
to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his
life and whose attachments were strong </s>
<s>  the plan of a drain the change
of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for
wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality
of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible </s>
<s>  and if his
willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries
even approached a tone of eagerness </s>
<s> 

while they were thus comfortably occupied <abvr> woodhouse was enjoying a
full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter </s>
<s> 

my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and
interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her
five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you were here </s>
<s>

<s>  my dear emma suppose we all
have a little gruel </s>
<s> 

emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself </s>
<s> and
two basins only were ordered </s>
<s>  after a little more discourse in praise of
gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every
body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection

end instead of coming here </s>

mr </s>

ah </s>

good </s>

uneasiness about it </s>

it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use
to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have

no i do not know that <abvr> wingfield considers it very sickly

ah </s>
<s>  my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always
a sickly season </s>
<s>  nobody is healthy in london nobody can be </s>
<s>  it is a
dreadful thing to have you forced to live there </s>

<s> and the
air so bad </s>
<s> 

no indeedwe are not at all in a bad air </s>
<s>  our part of london is
very superior to most others </s>
<s> you must not confound us with london
in general my dear sir </s>
<s>  the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very
different from almost all the rest </s>

unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town </s>
<s> there is
hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in </s>

<s> <abvr> wingfield thinks the vicinity of
brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air </s>

ah </s>

<s>  you make the best of itbut
after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different

i am sorry to hear you say so sir </s>

little nervous headaches and palpitations which i am never entirely
free from anywhere i am quite well myself </s>

rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a
little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of
coming </s>
<s>  i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow </s>

assure you <abvr> wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever
sent us off altogether in such good case </s>

you do not think <abvr> knightley looking ill turning her eyes with
affectionate anxiety towards her husband </s>

very far from looking well </s>

what is the matter sir </s>

knightley hearing his own name </s>

i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking

wished however as you know that you had seen <abvr> wingfield before you

from scotland to look after his new estate </s>
<s>  what will it answer </s>
<s>  will
not the old prejudice be too strong </s>
<s> 

and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to
give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing
worse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and jane
fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that
moment very happy to assist in praising </s>

that sweet amiable jane fairfax </s>
<s>  said <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> it
is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment
accidentally in town </s>
<s>  what happiness it must be to her good old
grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them </s>
<s>  i always
regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot be more at
highbury </s>
<s>  but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and <abvr>
campbell will not be able to part with her at all </s>
<s>  she would be such a
delightful companion for emma </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse agreed to it all but added

our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty
kind of young person </s>
<s>  you will like harriet </s>
<s>  emma could not have a
better companion than harriet </s>
<s> 

i am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be so
very accomplished and superior </s>
<s> and exactly emmas age </s>
<s> 

this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar
moment and passed away with similar harmony </s>
<s>  but the evening did not
close without a little return of agitation </s>
<s>  the gruel came and supplied
a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many commentsundoubting
decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty
severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with
tolerably </s>
<s> but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter
had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in
her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never
had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth
gruel thin but not too thin </s>
<s>  often as she had wished for and ordered
it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable </s>
<s>  here was a
dangerous opening </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her
with tender concern </s>
<s> the ejaculation in emmas ear expressed ah </s>
<s> 
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end </s>
<s>  it
does not bear talking of </s>
<s>  and for a little while she hoped he would not
talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to
the relish of his own smooth gruel </s>
<s>  after an interval of some minutes
however he began with

i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn
instead of coming here </s>
<s> 

but why should you be sorry sir </s>
<s> i assure you it did the children a
great deal of good </s>
<s> 

and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been
to south end </s>
<s>  south end is an unhealthy place </s>
<s>  perry was surprized to
hear you had fixed upon south end </s>
<s> 

i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite
a mistake sir </s>
<s> we all had our health perfectly well there never
found the least inconvenience from the mud </s>
<s>  and <abvr> wingfield says it is
entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy </s>
<s>  and i am sure he may
be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and
his own brother and family have been there repeatedly </s>
<s> 

you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere </s>
<s> perry
was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the
seabathing places </s>

<s>  and by
what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from
the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable </s>
<s>  you should have
consulted perry </s>
<s> 

but my dear sir the difference of the journey </s>
<s> only consider how
great it would have been </s>
<s> an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else
should be considered </s>
<s>  and if one is to travel there is not much to
chuse between forty miles and an hundred </s>
<s> better not move at all
better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into
a worse air </s>
<s>  this is just what perry said </s>
<s>  it seemed to him a very
illjudged measure </s>

emmas attempts to stop her father had been vain </s>
<s>  and when he
had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her

mr </s>

one part of the coast or another </s>

his drugs </s>
<s>  he pausedand growing cooler in a moment added with only
sarcastic dryness if <abvr> perry can tell me how to convey a wife and
five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater
expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as
willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself </s>
<s> 

true true cried <abvr> knightley with most ready interpositionvery
true </s>

<s> but john as to what i was telling
you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the
right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive
any difficulty </s>

inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly
the present line of the path </s>

your opinion </s>

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his
friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been
attributing many of his own feelings and expressions </s>

attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and
the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the

chapter xiii


there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than <abvr> john
knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning
among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what
she had done every evening with her father and sister </s>
<s>  she had nothing
to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly </s>
<s>  it was a
delightful visit </s>
<s> perfect in being much too short </s>
<s> 

in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their
mornings </s>
<s>  but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too
there was no avoiding though at christmas </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would take no
denial </s>
<s>  they must all dine at randalls one day </s>
<s> even <abvr> woodhouse was
persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of
the party </s>
<s> 

how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he
could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses were actually
at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on
that head </s>
<s>  it hardly amounted to a doubt </s>
<s>  nor did it occupy emma long
to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for
harriet also </s>
<s> 

harriet <abvr> elton and <abvr> knightley their own especial set were the
only persons invited to meet them </s>
<s> the hours were to be early as
well as the numbers few </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouses habits and inclination being
consulted in every thing </s>
<s> 

the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse should dine out on the th of december had been spent
by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with
a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by <abvr>
goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house </s>
<s>  emma called
on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to
randalls </s>
<s>  she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat </s>
<s>  <abvr> goddard
was full of care and affection <abvr> perry was talked of and harriet
herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her
from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss
without many tears </s>
<s> 

emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in <abvr> goddards
unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much <abvr>
eltons would be depressed when he knew her state </s>
<s>  and left her at last
tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most
comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much </s>
<s>  she had not
advanced many yards from <abvr> goddards door when she was met by <abvr>
elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly
together in conversation about the invalidof whom he on the rumour
of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might
carry some report of her to hartfieldthey were overtaken by <abvr> john
knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest
boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country
run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice
pudding they were hastening home for </s>
<s>  they joined company and
proceeded together </s>
<s>  emma was just describing the nature of her friends
complaint </s>
<s> a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat
about her a quick low pulse &c </s>
<s>  and she was sorry to find from <abvr>
goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often
alarmed her with them </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton looked all alarm on the occasion as
he exclaimed

a sorethroat </s>
<s> i hope not infectious </s>
<s>  i hope not of a putrid
infectious sort </s>
<s>  has perry seen her </s>
<s>  indeed you should take care of
yourself as well as of your friend </s>
<s>  let me entreat you to run no risks </s>
<s> 
why does not perry see her </s>
<s> 

emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of <abvr> goddards experience and
care </s>
<s>  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she
could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist
than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite another subject

it is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much like
snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i
should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father from
venturing </s>
<s>  but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the
cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great
a disappointment to <abvr> and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  but upon my word <abvr> elton
in your case i should certainly excuse myself </s>
<s>  you appear to me a
little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and
what fatigues tomorrow will bring i think it would be no more than
common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself tonight </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make </s>
<s> 
which was exactly the case </s>
<s>  for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of hers
he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit </s>
<s> but emma
too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him
impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with
his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very
cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls
and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour
of the evening </s>
<s> 

you do quite right said she </s>
<s> we will make your apologies to <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s> 

but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly
offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were <abvr> eltons only
objection and <abvr> elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt
satisfaction </s>
<s>  it was a done thing </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was to go and never had
his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment </s>
<s> 
never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when
he next looked at her </s>
<s> 

well said she to herself this is most strange </s>
<s> after i had got
him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill
behind </s>
<s> most strange indeed </s>
<s> but there is i believe in many men
especially single men such an inclinationsuch a passion for dining
outa dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures
their employments their dignities almost their duties that any
thing gives way to itand this must be the case with <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  a most
valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love
with harriet </s>
<s>  but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine
out wherever he is asked </s>
<s>  what a strange thing love is </s>
<s>  he can see ready
wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her </s>
<s> 

soon afterwards <abvr> elton quitted them and she could not but do him
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his
manner of naming harriet at parting </s>
<s>  in the tone of his voice while
assuring her that he should call at <abvr> goddards for news of her fair
friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting
her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report </s>
<s>  and
he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of
approbation much in his favour </s>
<s> 

after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began
with

i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned </s>
<s>  with
men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please
every feature works </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  eltons manners are not perfect replied emma </s>
<s>  but where there is
a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great
deal </s>
<s>  where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will
have the advantage over negligent superiority </s>
<s>  there is such perfect
goodtemper and goodwill in <abvr> elton as one cannot but value </s>
<s> 

yes said <abvr> john knightley presently with some slyness he seems
to have a great deal of goodwill towards you </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to
be <abvr> eltons object </s>
<s> 

such an imagination has crossed me i own emma </s>
<s>  and if it never
occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton in love with me </s>
<s> what an idea </s>
<s> 

i do not say it is so </s>
<s>  but you will do well to consider whether it
is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly </s>
<s>  i think your
manners to him encouraging </s>
<s>  i speak as a friend emma </s>
<s>  you had better
look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do </s>
<s> 

i thank you </s>
<s>  but i assure you you are quite mistaken </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton and
i are very good friends and nothing more </s>
<s>  and she walked on amusing
herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a
partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high
pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into </s>
<s>  and not very well
pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in
want of counsel </s>
<s>  he said no more </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in
spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking
from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest
daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the
weather than either of the others </s>
<s>  too full of the wonder of his own
going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was
cold and too well wrapt up to feel it </s>
<s>  the cold however was severe </s>
<s> 
and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow
were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so
overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world
in a very short time </s>
<s> 

emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour </s>
<s>  the
preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of
his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least
which <abvr> john knightley did not by any means like </s>
<s>  he anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase </s>
<s>  and the
whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his
discontent </s>
<s> 

a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks
people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as
this for the sake of coming to see him </s>
<s>  he must think himself a most
agreeable fellow </s>
<s>  i could not do such a thing </s>
<s>  it is the greatest
absurdityactually snowing at this moment </s>
<s> the folly of not allowing
people to be comfortable at homeand the folly of peoples not staying
comfortably at home when they can </s>
<s>  if we were obliged to go out such

emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no

any answer at all </s>

they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and <abvr> elton

pleasure of some change of subject </s>

cheerfulness </s>

emma smiled and answeredmy visit was of use to the nervous part of

the season indeed for friendly meetings </s>

at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much

chapter xiv


some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they
walked into <abvr> westons drawingroom </s>
<s> <abvr> elton must compose his
joyous looks and <abvr> john knightley disperse his illhumour </s>
<s>  <abvr>
elton must smile less and <abvr> john knightley more to fit them for the
place </s>
<s> emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as
happy as she was </s>
<s>  to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the
world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife </s>
<s>  not any
one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and
understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the
little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father
and herself </s>
<s>  she could tell nothing of hartfield in which <abvr> weston
had not a lively concern </s>
<s>  and half an hours uninterrupted communication
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life
depends was one of the first gratifications of each </s>
<s> 

this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might not
afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour </s>
<s>  but the
very sight of <abvr> weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful
to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of <abvr>
eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that
was enjoyable to the utmost </s>
<s> 

the misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through
before her arrival </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse had been safely seated long enough
to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and
isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed just
got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his
daughter when the others appeared and <abvr> weston who had been almost
wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and
welcome her dear emma </s>
<s> 

emmas project of forgetting <abvr> elton for a while made her rather sorry
to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her </s>
<s> 
the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards
harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but
was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and
solicitously addressing her upon every occasion </s>
<s>  instead of forgetting
him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal
suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined </s>
<s>  can it be
possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from
harriet to me </s>
<s> absurd and insufferable </s>
<s> yet he would be so anxious
for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father
and so delighted with <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  and at last would begin admiring her
drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly
like a wouldbe lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her
good manners </s>
<s>  for her own sake she could not be rude </s>
<s>  and for harriets
in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively
civil </s>
<s>  but it was an effort </s>
<s>  especially as something was going on
amongst the others in the most overpowering period of <abvr> eltons
nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to </s>
<s>  she heard enough
to know that <abvr> weston was giving some information about his son </s>
<s>  she
heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several
times over </s>
<s>  and from a few other halfsyllables very much suspected
that he was announcing an early visit from his son </s>
<s>  but before she could
quiet <abvr> elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving
question from her would have been awkward </s>
<s> 

now it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never
marrying there was something in the name in the idea of <abvr>
frank churchill which always interested her </s>
<s>  she had frequently
thoughtespecially since his fathers marriage with miss taylorthat
if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age
character and condition </s>
<s>  he seemed by this connexion between the
families quite to belong to her </s>
<s>  she could not but suppose it to be
a match that every body who knew them must think of </s>
<s>  that <abvr> and <abvr>
weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded </s>
<s>  and though
not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a
situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could
change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention
of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and
a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends
imaginations </s>
<s> 

with such sensations <abvr> eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed </s>
<s> 
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very
crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly
pass without bringing forward the same information again or the
substance of it from the openhearted <abvr> weston </s>
<s> so it proved </s>
<s> for
when happily released from <abvr> elton and seated by <abvr> weston
at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of
hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to
her

we want only two more to be just the right number </s>
<s>  i should like to see
two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith and my sonand
then i should say we were quite complete </s>
<s>  i believe you did not hear me
telling the others in the drawingroom that we are expecting frank </s>
<s> 
i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a
fortnight </s>
<s> 

emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure </s>
<s>  and fully assented to
his proposition of <abvr> frank churchill and miss smith making their party
quite complete </s>
<s> 

he has been wanting to come to us continued <abvr> weston ever since
september </s>
<s>  every letter has been full of it </s>
<s>  but he cannot command his
own time </s>
<s>  he has those to please who must be pleased and who between
ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices </s>
<s> 
but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in
january </s>
<s> 

what a very great pleasure it will be to you </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston is so
anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as
yourself </s>
<s> 

yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another putoff </s>
<s> 
she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do </s>
<s>  but she does not
know the parties so well as i do </s>
<s>  the case you see isbut this is
quite between ourselves </s>
<s>  i did not mention a syllable of it in the other
room </s>
<s>  there are secrets in all families you knowthe case is that a
party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january </s>
<s>  and
that franks coming depends upon their being put off </s>
<s>  if they are not
put off he cannot stir </s>
<s>  but i know they will because it is a family
that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular
dislike to </s>
<s>  and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in
two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point </s>
<s> 
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue </s>
<s>  i am as confident of seeing
frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself </s>
<s> 
but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table
has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at
hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been
long in the practice of doing </s>
<s> 

i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied
emma </s>
<s>  but am disposed to side with you <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  if you think he
will come i shall think so too </s>
<s>  for you know enscombe </s>
<s> 

yesi have some right to that knowledge </s>
<s>  though i have never been at
the place in my life </s>
<s> she is an odd woman </s>
<s> but i never allow myself
to speak ill of her on franks account </s>
<s>  for i do believe her to be very
fond of him </s>
<s>  i used to think she was not capable of being fond of
any body except herself </s>
<s>  but she has always been kind to him in her
wayallowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing
to be as she likes </s>
<s>  and it is no small credit in my opinion to him
that he should excite such an affection </s>
<s>  for though i would not say
it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in
general </s>
<s>  and the devil of a temper </s>
<s> 

emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to <abvr> weston
very soon after their moving into the drawingroom </s>
<s>  wishing her joyyet
observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  weston agreed to it </s>
<s>  but added that she should be very glad to be
secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked
of </s>
<s>  for i cannot depend upon his coming </s>
<s>  i cannot be so sanguine as
mr </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands </s>
<s> 

yesit seems to depend upon nothing but the illhumour of <abvr>
churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world </s>
<s> 

my emma </s>
<s>  replied <abvr> weston smiling what is the certainty
of caprice </s>
<s>  then turning to isabella who had not been attending
beforeyou must know my dear <abvr> knightley that we are by no means
so sure of seeing <abvr> frank churchill in my opinion as his father
thinks </s>
<s>  it depends entirely upon his aunts spirits and pleasure </s>
<s>  in
short upon her temper </s>
<s>  to youto my two daughtersi may venture on
the truth </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill rules at enscombe and is a very oddtempered
woman </s>
<s>  and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him </s>
<s> 

oh <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  every body knows <abvr> churchill replied isabella </s>
<s> 
and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest
compassion </s>
<s>  to be constantly living with an illtempered person must
be dreadful </s>
<s>  it is what we happily have never known any thing of </s>
<s>  but
it must be a life of misery </s>
<s>  what a blessing that she never had any
children </s>
<s>  poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them </s>
<s> 

emma wished she had been alone with <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she should then have
heard more </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve
which she would not hazard with isabella </s>
<s>  and she really believed
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills
from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge </s>
<s>  but at
present there was nothing more to be said </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse very soon
followed them into the drawingroom </s>
<s>  to be sitting long after
dinner was a confinement that he could not endure </s>
<s>  neither wine nor
conversation was any thing to him </s>
<s>  and gladly did he move to those with
whom he was always comfortable </s>
<s> 

while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of
saying

and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means
certain </s>
<s>  i am sorry for it </s>
<s>  the introduction must be unpleasant
whenever it takes place </s>
<s>  and the sooner it could be over the better </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays </s>
<s>  even
if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that
some excuse may be found for disappointing us </s>
<s>  i cannot bear to imagine
any reluctance on his side </s>
<s>  but i am sure there is a great wish on
the churchills to keep him to themselves </s>
<s>  there is jealousy </s>
<s>  they
are jealous even of his regard for his father </s>
<s>  in short i can feel no
dependence on his coming and i wish <abvr> weston were less sanguine </s>
<s> 

he ought to come said emma </s>
<s>  if he could stay only a couple of days
he ought to come </s>
<s>  and one can hardly conceive a young mans not having
it in his power to do as much as that </s>
<s>  a young woman if she fall into
bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants
to be with </s>
<s>  but one cannot comprehend a young manòs being under such
restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he
likes it </s>
<s> 

one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before
one decides upon what he can do replied <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  one ought to
use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one
individual of any one family </s>
<s>  but enscombe i believe certainly must
not be judged by general rules </s>
<s>  she is so very unreasonable </s>
<s>  and every
thing gives way to her </s>
<s> 

but she is so fond of the nephew </s>
<s>  he is so very great a favourite </s>
<s>  now
according to my idea of <abvr> churchill it would be most natural that
while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she
owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him
she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes
nothing at all </s>
<s> 

my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand
a bad one or to lay down rules for it </s>
<s>  you must let it go its own way </s>
<s> 
i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence </s>
<s>  but it
may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will
be </s>
<s> 

emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless
he comes </s>
<s> 

he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued <abvr>
weston and on others very little </s>
<s>  and among those on which she is
beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of
his coming away from them to visit us </s>

chapter xv


mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was soon ready for his tea </s>
<s>  and when he had drank his
tea he was quite ready to go home </s>
<s>  and it was as much as his three
companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of
the hour before the other gentlemen appeared </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was chatty and
convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort </s>
<s>  but at last
the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton in very
good spirits was one of the first to walk in </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston and emma
were sitting together on a sofa </s>
<s>  he joined them immediately and with
scarcely an invitation seated himself between them </s>
<s> 

emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by
the expectation of <abvr> frank churchill was willing to forget his late
improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his
making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most
friendly smiles </s>
<s> 

he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friendher fair
lovely amiable friend </s>
<s>  did she know </s>
<s> had she heard any thing about
her since their being at randalls </s>
<s> he felt much anxietyhe must
confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably </s>
<s> 
 and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much
attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror
of a bad sore throat </s>
<s>  and emma was quite in charity with him </s>
<s> 

but at last there seemed a perverse turn </s>
<s>  it seemed all at once as if he
were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on
harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection than
that there should be no infection in the complaint </s>
<s>  he began with great
earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sickchamber
again for the presentto entreat her to promise him not to venture
into such hazard till he had seen <abvr> perry and learnt his opinion </s>
<s>  and
though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its
proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude
about her </s>
<s>  she was vexed </s>
<s>  it did appearthere was no concealing
itexactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of
harriet </s>
<s>  an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable </s>
<s> 
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper </s>
<s>  he turned to <abvr> weston
to implore her assistance would not she give him her support </s>
<s> would
not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go
to <abvr> goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder had
no infection </s>
<s>  he could not be satisfied without a promisewould not she
give him her influence in procuring it </s>
<s> 

so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for
herself </s>
<s>  she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today and
yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore
throat herself </s>
<s>  is this fair <abvr> weston </s>
<s> judge between us </s>
<s>  have not i
some right to complain </s>
<s>  i am sure of your kind support and aid </s>
<s> 

emma saw <abvr> westons surprize and felt that it must be great at an
address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of
first interest in her </s>
<s>  and as for herself she was too much provoked and
offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose </s>
<s> 
she could only give him a look </s>
<s>  but it was such a look as she thought
must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a
seat by her sister and giving her all her attention </s>
<s> 

she had not time to know how <abvr> elton took the reproof so rapidly did
another subject succeed </s>
<s>  for <abvr> john knightley now came into the room
from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information
of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing
fast with a strong drifting wind </s>
<s>  concluding with these words to <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s> 

this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements
sir </s>
<s>  something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way
through a storm of snow </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> woodhouse was silent from consternation </s>
<s>  but every body else
had something to say </s>
<s>  every body was either surprized or not surprized
and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his
soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly </s>
<s> 

i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out
in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon </s>
<s> 
every body must have seen the snow coming on </s>
<s>  i admired your spirit </s>
<s>  and
i dare say we shall get home very well </s>
<s>  another hour or twos snow can

<s>  and we are two carriages </s>

blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other
at hand </s>
<s>  i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he
had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest
it should make <abvr> woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his
hurrying away </s>
<s>  as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely
to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke </s>
<s>  he was afraid they
would find no difficulty </s>
<s>  he wished the road might be impassable that
he might be able to keep them all at randalls </s>
<s>  and with the utmost
goodwill was sure that accommodation might be found for every body
calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance
every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the
consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house </s>
<s> 

what is to be done my dear emma </s>
<s> what is to be done </s>
<s>  was <abvr>
woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say for some
time </s>
<s>  to her he looked for comfort </s>
<s>  and her assurances of safety her
representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of
their having so many friends about them revived him a little </s>
<s> 

his eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own </s>
<s>  the horror of being
blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full
in her imagination </s>
<s>  and fancying the road to be now just passable for
adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager
to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls
while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible
accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them </s>
<s> 

you had better order the carriage directly my love said she </s>
<s>  i dare
say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly </s>
<s>  and if we
do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk </s>
<s>  i am not at all
afraid </s>
<s>  i should not mind walking half the way </s>
<s>  i could change my shoes
you know the moment i got home </s>

<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  replied he </s>
<s>  then my dear isabella it is the most
extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing
does give you cold </s>
<s>  walk home </s>
<s> you are prettily shod for walking home

<s> 

isabella turned to <abvr> weston for her approbation of the plan </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston could only approve </s>
<s>  isabella then went to emma </s>
<s>  but emma could
not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away </s>
<s> 
and they were still discussing the point when <abvr> knightley who had
left the room immediately after his brothers first report of the snow
came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine
and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their
getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence </s>
<s>  he
had gone beyond the sweepsome way along the highbury roadthe snow
was nowhere above half an inch deepin many places hardly enough to
whiten the ground </s>
<s>  a very few flakes were falling at present but the
clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon
over </s>
<s>  he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there
being nothing to apprehend </s>
<s> 

to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were
scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account who
was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous
constitution allowed </s>
<s>  but the alarm that had been raised could not be
appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at
randalls </s>
<s>  he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning
home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay </s>
<s>  and

happiness when this visit of hardship were over </s>

the carriage came </s>

so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second

<s>  it would not have been
the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure

to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was

he was too angry to say another word </s>

chapter xvi


the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think
and be miserable </s>
<s> it was a wretched business indeed </s>
<s> such an overthrow
of every thing she had been wishing for </s>
<s> such a development of every
thing most unwelcome </s>
<s> such a blow for harriet </s>
<s> that was the worst
of all </s>
<s>  every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or
other </s>
<s>  but compared with the evil to harriet all was light </s>
<s>  and
she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistakenmore in
errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she actually was could the
effects of her blunders have been confined to herself </s>
<s> 

if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have
borne any thing </s>
<s>  he might have doubled his presumption to mebut poor
harriet </s>
<s> 

how she could have been so deceived </s>
<s> he protested that he had never
thought seriously of harrietnever </s>
<s>  she looked back as well as
she could </s>
<s>  but it was all confusion </s>
<s>  she had taken up the idea she
supposed and made every thing bend to it </s>
<s>  his manners however must
have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so
misled </s>
<s> 

the picture </s>
<s> how eager he had been about the picture </s>
<s> and the
charade </s>
<s> and an hundred other circumstances </s>
<s> how clearly they had
seemed to point at harriet </s>
<s>  to be sure the charade with its ready
witbut then the soft eyesin fact it suited neither </s>
<s>  it was
a jumble without taste or truth </s>
<s>  who could have seen through such
thickheaded nonsense </s>
<s> 

certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to
herself unnecessarily gallant </s>
<s>  but it had passed as his way as a mere
error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others
that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the
gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting </s>
<s>  but
till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean
any thing but grateful respect to her as harriets friend </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the
subject for the first start of its possibility </s>
<s>  there was no denying
that those brothers had penetration </s>
<s>  she remembered what <abvr> knightley
had once said to her about <abvr> elton the caution he had given
the conviction he had professed that <abvr> elton would never marry
indiscreetly </s>
<s>  and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his
character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself </s>
<s>  it
was dreadfully mortifying </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton was proving himself in many
respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him </s>
<s> 
proud assuming conceited </s>
<s>  very full of his own claims and little
concerned about the feelings of others </s>
<s> 

contrary to the usual course of things <abvr> eltons wanting to pay his
addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion </s>
<s>  his professions and his
proposals did him no service </s>
<s>  she thought nothing of his attachment
and was insulted by his hopes </s>
<s>  he wanted to marry well and having the
arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love </s>
<s>  but she was
perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be
cared for </s>
<s>  there had been no real affection either in his language or
manners </s>
<s>  sighs and fine words had been given in abundance </s>
<s>  but she could
hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less
allied with real love </s>
<s>  she need not trouble herself to pity him </s>
<s>  he
only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself </s>
<s>  and if miss woodhouse
of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so
easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody
else with twenty or with ten </s>
<s> 

butthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware
of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry
him </s>
<s> should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind </s>
<s> look down
upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below
him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no
presumption in addressing her </s>
<s> it was most provoking </s>
<s> 

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her
inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind </s>
<s>  the very want of
such equality might prevent his perception of it </s>
<s>  but he must know that
in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior </s>
<s>  he must
know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at
hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient familyand that the
eltons were nobody </s>
<s>  the landed property of hartfield certainly was
inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate
to which all the rest of highbury belonged </s>
<s>  but their fortune from
other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell
abbey itself in every other kind of consequence </s>
<s>  and the woodhouses had
long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which
mr </s>
<s>  elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he
could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him
to notice but his situation and his civility </s>
<s> but he had fancied her
in love with him </s>
<s>  that evidently must have been his dependence </s>
<s>  and
after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners
and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop
and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and
obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real
motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and
delicacy like <abvr> elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite </s>
<s> 
if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to
wonder that he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken
hers </s>
<s> 

the first error and the worst lay at her door </s>
<s>  it was foolish it was
wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together </s>
<s>  it
was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what
ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple </s>
<s>  she was quite
concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more </s>
<s> 

here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very
much attached to this man </s>
<s>  she might never have thought of him but for
me </s>
<s>  and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had
not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i
used to think him </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  that i had been satisfied with persuading her not
to accept young martin </s>
<s>  there i was quite right </s>
<s>  that was well done
of me </s>
<s>  but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and
chance </s>
<s>  i was introducing her into good company and giving her the
opportunity of pleasing some one worth having </s>
<s>  i ought not to have
attempted more </s>
<s>  but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time </s>
<s> 
i have been but half a friend to her </s>
<s>  and if she were not to feel this
disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body
else who would be at all desirable for her </s>
<s> william coxeoh </s>
<s>  no i
could not endure william coxea pert young lawyer </s>
<s> 

she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more
serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be
and must be </s>
<s>  the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and
all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of
future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the
acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding
eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some
time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the
conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully </s>
<s> 

to youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under temporary
gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of
spirits </s>
<s>  the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy
and of powerful operation </s>
<s>  and if the distress be not poignant enough
to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of
softened pain and brighter hope </s>
<s> 

emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone
to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to
depend on getting tolerably out of it </s>
<s> 

it was a great consolation that <abvr> elton should not be really in
love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to
disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that superior
sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentiveand that there
could be no necessity for any bodys knowing what had passed except the
three principals and especially for her fathers being given a moments
uneasiness about it </s>
<s> 

these were very cheering thoughts </s>
<s>  and the sight of a great deal of snow
on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that
might justify their all three being quite asunder at present </s>
<s> 

the weather was most favourable for her </s>
<s>  though christmas day she
could not go to church </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse would have been miserable had his
daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting
or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas </s>
<s>  the ground covered
with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and
thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every
morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to
freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner </s>
<s>  no intercourse
with harriet possible but by note </s>
<s>  no church for her on sunday any
more than on christmas day </s>
<s>  and no need to find excuses for <abvr> eltons
absenting himself </s>
<s> 

it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home </s>
<s>  and though
she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society
or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with
his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out </s>
<s>  and to
hear him say to <abvr> knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from
them

ah </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley why do not you stay at home like poor <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

these days of confinement would have been but for her private
perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited
her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to
his companions </s>
<s>  and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his
illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the
rest of his stay at hartfield </s>
<s>  he was always agreeable and obliging
and speaking pleasantly of every body </s>
<s>  but with all the hopes of
cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such
an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as
made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease </s>

chapter xvii


mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> john knightley were not detained long at hartfield </s>
<s>  the
weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay
behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party
set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor
isabella </s>
<s> which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated
on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently
busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness </s>
<s> 

the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from <abvr>
elton to <abvr> woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with
mr </s>
<s>  eltons best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury
the following morning in his way to bath </s>
<s>  where in compliance with
the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few
weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from
various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal
leave of <abvr> woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever
retain a grateful senseand had <abvr> woodhouse any commands should be
happy to attend to them </s>
<s> 

emma was most agreeably surprized </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  eltons absence just at this
time was the very thing to be desired </s>
<s>  she admired him for contriving
it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it
was announced </s>
<s>  resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than
in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded </s>
<s> 
she had not even a share in his opening compliments </s>
<s> her name was not
mentioned </s>
<s> and there was so striking a change in all this and such an
illjudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments as
she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion </s>
<s> 

it did however </s>
<s> her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so
sudden a journey and his fears that <abvr> elton might never get safely to
the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language </s>
<s>  it was a
very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought
and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse
talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away
with all her usual promptitude </s>
<s> 

she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark </s>
<s>  she had reason
to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that
she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of
her other complaint before the gentlemans return </s>
<s>  she went to <abvr>
goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary
penance of communication </s>
<s>  and a severe one it was </s>
<s> she had to destroy
all the hopes which she had been so industriously feedingto appear in
the ungracious character of the one preferredand acknowledge herself
grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her ideas on one subject all
her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last
six weeks </s>
<s> 

the confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight of
harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity with
herself again </s>
<s> 

harriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobodyand in every
thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion
of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to
her friend </s>
<s> 

emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost </s>
<s> 
and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on
harriets side not her own </s>
<s>  harriet did not consider herself as having
any thing to complain of </s>
<s>  the affection of such a man as <abvr> elton
would have been too great a distinction </s>
<s> she never could have deserved
himand nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would
have thought it possible </s>
<s> 

her tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless that
no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyesand
she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and
understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was the
superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would be more for
her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could
do </s>
<s> 

it was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded and
ignorant </s>
<s>  but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of
being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of
her life </s>
<s>  her second duty now inferior only to her fathers claims was
to promote harriets comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection
in some better method than by matchmaking </s>
<s>  she got her to hartfield
and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and
amuse her and by books and conversation to drive <abvr> elton from her
thoughts </s>
<s> 

time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done </s>
<s>  and
she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in
general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to <abvr> elton
in particular </s>
<s>  but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age
and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be
made towards a state of composure by the time of <abvr> eltons return as
to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them </s>
<s> 

harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence
of any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth
prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen </s>
<s>  but yet
it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an
inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its
continuing very long in equal force </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and
indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not
imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the
recollection of him </s>
<s> 

their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for
each for all three </s>
<s>  not one of them had the power of removal or of
effecting any material change of society </s>
<s>  they must encounter each
other and make the best of it </s>
<s> 

harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at <abvr>
goddards </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great
girls in the school </s>
<s>  and it must be at hartfield only that she could
have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or
repellent truth </s>
<s>  where the wound had been given there must the cure be
found if anywhere </s>
<s>  and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of
cure there could be no true peace for herself </s>

chapter xviii

westons fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse </s>

randalls at no distant period </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed in
fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man
had been so much more sober </s>
<s>  but a sanguine temper though for ever
expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by
any proportionate depression </s>

sorry </s>
<s>  but then he began to perceive that franks coming two or three
months later would be a much better plan </s>
<s>  better time of year </s>

better weather </s>

considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner </s>

these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while <abvr> weston of
a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of
excuses and delays </s>

to suffer suffered a great deal more herself </s>

as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into <abvr>
and <abvr> westons disappointment as might naturally belong to their
friendship </s>
<s> 

she was the first to announce it to <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and exclaimed quite
as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather
more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away </s>
<s>  she then
proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of
such an addition to their confined society in surry </s>
<s>  the pleasure of
looking at somebody new </s>
<s>  the galaday to highbury entire which the
sight of him would have made </s>
<s>  and ending with reflections on the
churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement
with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  and to her great amusement perceived that she was
taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making
use of <abvr> westons arguments against herself </s>
<s> 

the churchills are very likely in fault said <abvr> knightley coolly </s>
<s> 
but i dare say he might come if he would </s>
<s> 

i do not know why you should say so </s>
<s>  he wishes exceedingly to come </s>
<s>  but
his uncle and aunt will not spare him </s>
<s> 

i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a
point of it </s>
<s>  it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof </s>
<s> 

how odd you are </s>
<s>  what has <abvr> frank churchill done to make you suppose
him such an unnatural creature </s>
<s> 

i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that
he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little
for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have
always set him the example of it </s>
<s>  it is a great deal more natural than
one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud
luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too </s>
<s>  if
frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it
between september and january </s>
<s>  a man at his agewhat is he </s>
<s> three or
fourandtwentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that </s>
<s> 
it is impossible </s>
<s> 

thats easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your
own master </s>
<s>  you are the worst judge in the world <abvr> knightley of the
difficulties of dependence </s>
<s>  you do not know what it is to have tempers
to manage </s>
<s> 

it is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount </s>
<s>  he cannot want
moneyhe cannot want leisure </s>
<s>  we know on the contrary that he has so
much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in
the kingdom </s>
<s>  we hear of him for ever at some wateringplace or other </s>
<s>  a
little while ago he was at weymouth </s>
<s>  this proves that he can leave the
churchills </s>
<s> 

yes sometimes he can </s>
<s> 

and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while </s>
<s>  whenever
there is any temptation of pleasure </s>
<s> 

it is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an intimate
knowledge of their situation </s>
<s>  nobody who has not been in the interior
of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that
family may be </s>
<s>  we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with <abvr>
churchills temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew
can do </s>
<s>  he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at
others </s>
<s> 

there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and
that is his duty </s>
<s>  not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and
resolution </s>
<s>  it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention to his
father </s>
<s>  he knows it to be so by his promises and messages </s>
<s>  but if he
wished to do it it might be done </s>
<s>  a man who felt rightly would say at
once simply and resolutely to <abvr> churchillòevery sacrifice of
mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience </s>
<s> 
but i must go and see my father immediately </s>
<s>  i know he would be hurt by
my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion </s>
<s> 
i shall therefore set off tomorrow </s>
<s> if he would say so to her
at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no
opposition made to his going </s>
<s> 

no said emma laughing </s>
<s>  but perhaps there might be some made to his
coming back again </s>
<s>  such language for a young man entirely dependent to
use </s>
<s> nobody but you <abvr> knightley would imagine it possible </s>
<s>  but you
have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to
your own </s>
<s>  <abvr> frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to
the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for
him </s>
<s> standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as
loud as he could </s>
<s> how can you imagine such conduct practicable </s>
<s> 

depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it </s>
<s>  he
would feel himself in the right </s>
<s>  and the declarationmade of course
as a man of sense would make it in a proper mannerwould do him more
good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he
depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do </s>
<s> 
respect would be added to affection </s>
<s>  they would feel that they could
trust him </s>
<s>  that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do
rightly by them </s>
<s>  for they know as well as he does as well as all the
world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father </s>
<s>  and
while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not
thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims </s>
<s>  respect for
right conduct is felt by every body </s>
<s>  if he would act in this sort of
manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would
bend to his </s>
<s> 

i rather doubt that </s>
<s>  you are very fond of bending little minds </s>
<s>  but
where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have
a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great
ones </s>
<s>  i can imagine that if you as you are <abvr> knightley were to be
transported and placed all at once in <abvr> frank churchills situation
you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for
him </s>
<s>  and it might have a very good effect </s>
<s>  the churchills might not have
a word to say in return </s>
<s>  but then you would have no habits of early
obedience and long observance to break through </s>
<s>  to him who has it might
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set
all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought </s>
<s>  he may have as
strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so
equal under particular circumstances to act up to it </s>
<s> 

then it would not be so strong a sense </s>
<s>  if it failed to produce equal
exertion it could not be an equal conviction </s>
<s> 

oh the difference of situation and habit </s>
<s>  i wish you would try to
understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly
opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his
life </s>
<s> 

our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the
will of others </s>
<s>  it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of
following his duty instead of consulting expediency </s>
<s>  i can allow for
the fears of the child but not of the man </s>
<s>  as he became rational he
ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in
their authority </s>
<s>  he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their
side to make him slight his father </s>
<s>  had he begun as he ought there
would have been no difficulty now </s>
<s> 

we shall never agree about him cried emma </s>
<s>  but that is nothing
extraordinary </s>
<s>  i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man </s>
<s> 
i feel sure that he is not </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston would not be blind to folly
though in his own son </s>
<s>  but he is very likely to have a more yielding
complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of mans
perfection </s>
<s>  i dare say he has </s>
<s>  and though it may cut him off from some
advantages it will secure him many others </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and
of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely
expert in finding excuses for it </s>
<s>  he can sit down and write a fine
flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade
himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of
preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers having any right to
complain </s>
<s>  his letters disgust me </s>
<s> 

your feelings are singular </s>
<s>  they seem to satisfy every body else </s>
<s> 

i suspect they do not satisfy <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  they hardly can satisfy
a woman of her good sense and quick feelings </s>
<s>  standing in a mothers
place but without a mothers affection to blind her </s>
<s>  it is on her
account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly
feel the omission </s>
<s>  had she been a person of consequence herself he
would have come i dare say </s>
<s>  and it would not have signified whether
he did or no </s>
<s>  can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of
considerations </s>
<s>  do you suppose she does not often say all this to
herself </s>
<s>  no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french
not in english </s>
<s>  he may be very òamiable have very good manners and be
very agreeable </s>
<s>  but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings
of other people </s>
<s>  nothing really amiable about him </s>
<s> 

you seem determined to think ill of him </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> not at all replied <abvr> knightley rather displeased </s>
<s>  i do not
want to think ill of him </s>
<s>  i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits
as any other man </s>
<s>  but i hear of none except what are merely personal </s>
<s> 
that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth plausible manners </s>
<s> 

well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure
at highbury </s>
<s>  we do not often look upon fine young men wellbred and
agreeable </s>
<s>  we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the
bargain </s>
<s>  cannot you imagine <abvr> knightley what a sensation his
coming will produce </s>
<s>  there will be but one subject throughout the
parishes of donwell and highbury </s>
<s>  but one interestone object of
curiosity </s>
<s>  it will be all <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  we shall think and speak
of nobody else </s>
<s> 

you will excuse my being so much overpowered </s>
<s>  if i find him
conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance </s>
<s>  but if he is only a
chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts </s>
<s> 

my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of
every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally
agreeable </s>
<s>  to you he will talk of farming </s>
<s>  to me of drawing or music </s>
<s> 
and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects
which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as
propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each </s>
<s>  that is my
idea of him </s>
<s> 

and mine said <abvr> knightley warmly is that if he turn out any
thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s> 
at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great manthe
practised politician who is to read every bodys character and make
every bodys talents conduce to the display of his own superiority </s>
<s>  to
be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like
fools compared with himself </s>
<s>  my dear emma your own good sense could not
endure such a puppy when it came to the point </s>
<s> 

i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to
evil </s>
<s>  we are both prejudiced </s>
<s>  you against i for him </s>
<s>  and we have no
chance of agreeing till he is really here </s>
<s> 

prejudiced </s>
<s>  i am not prejudiced </s>
<s> 

but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it </s>
<s>  my love for
mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour </s>
<s> 

he is a person i never think of from one months end to another said
mr </s>
<s>  knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately
talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be
angry </s>
<s> 

to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a
different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of
mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him </s>
<s>  for with all the
high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had
never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit
of another </s>

volume ii



chapter i


emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emmas
opinion had been talking enough of <abvr> elton for that day </s>
<s>  she could
not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more </s>
<s>  and
she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they
returned </s>
<s> but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded
and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and
receiving no other answer than a very plaintivemr </s>
<s>  elton is so good
to the poor </s>
<s>  she found something else must be done </s>
<s> 

they were just approaching the house where lived <abvr> and miss bates </s>
<s> 
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers </s>
<s>  there was
always sufficient reason for such an attention </s>
<s>  <abvr> and miss bates
loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few
who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in
that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of
their scanty comforts </s>
<s> 

she had had many a hint from <abvr> knightley and some from her own heart
as to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome womenand
all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate and
thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore
she seldom went near them </s>
<s>  but now she made the sudden resolution of not
passing their door without going inobserving as she proposed it to
harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite
safe from any letter from jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

the house belonged to people in business </s>
<s>  <abvr> and miss bates occupied
the drawingroom floor </s>
<s>  and there in the very moderatesized apartment
which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even
gratefully welcomed </s>
<s>  the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was
seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to
miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready
to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit
solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after <abvr> woodhouses
health cheerful communications about her mothers and sweetcake from
the beaufetmrs </s>
<s>  cole had just been there just called in for ten
minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had
taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much </s>
<s> 
and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them
the favour to eat a piece too </s>
<s> 

the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 
there was intimacy between them and <abvr> cole had heard from <abvr> elton
since his going away </s>
<s>  emma knew what was coming </s>
<s>  they must have the
letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much
he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went
and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been </s>
<s>  and she went
through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation
that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriets
being obliged to say a word </s>
<s> 

this she had been prepared for when she entered the house </s>
<s>  but meant
having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by
any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses
and misses of highbury and their cardparties </s>
<s>  she had not been
prepared to have jane fairfax succeed <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  but he was actually
hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to
the coles to usher in a letter from her niece </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesmr </s>
<s>  elton i understandcertainly as to dancingmrs </s>
<s>  cole
was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath wasmrs </s>
<s>  cole was so
kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane </s>
<s>  for as soon as
she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a
favourite there </s>
<s>  whenever she is with us <abvr> cole does not know how to
shew her kindness enough </s>
<s>  and i must say that jane deserves it as much
as any body can </s>
<s>  and so she began inquiring after her directly saying
òi know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her
time for writing </s>
<s>  and when i immediately said òbut indeed we have we
had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body
more surprized </s>
<s>  òhave you upon your honour </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  òwell that is
quite unexpected </s>
<s>  do let me hear what she says </s>
<s> 

emmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest

have you heard from miss fairfax so lately </s>
<s>  i am extremely happy </s>
<s>  i
hope she is well </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  you are so kind </s>
<s>  replied the happily deceived aunt while
eagerly hunting for the letter </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  here it is </s>
<s>  i was sure it could
not be far off </s>
<s>  but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being
aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately
that i was almost sure it must be on the table </s>
<s>  i was reading it to <abvr>
cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for
it is such a pleasure to hera letter from janethat she can never
hear it often enough </s>
<s>  so i knew it could not be far off and here it is
only just under my huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear
what she says </s>
<s> but first of all i really must in justice to
jane apologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you
seehardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses
half </s>
<s>  my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well </s>
<s>  she often
says when the letter is first opened òwell hetty now i think
you will be put to it to make out all that checkerworkdont you
maam </s>
<s> and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out
herself if she had nobody to do it for herevery word of iti am sure
she would pore over it till she had made out every word </s>
<s>  and indeed
though my mothers eyes are not so good as they were she can see
amazingly well still thank god </s>
<s>  with the help of spectacles </s>
<s>  it is such
a blessing </s>
<s>  my mothers are really very good indeed </s>
<s>  jane often says
when she is here òi am sure grandmama you must have had very strong
eyes to see as you doand so much fine work as you have done too </s>
<s> i
only wish my eyes may last me as well </s>
<s> 

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath </s>
<s> 
and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss
fairfaxs handwriting </s>
<s> 

you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified </s>
<s>  you who
are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself </s>
<s>  i am sure there is
nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouses </s>
<s> 
my mother does not hear </s>
<s>  she is a little deaf you know </s>
<s>  maam
 addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say
about janes handwriting </s>
<s> 

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated
twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it </s>
<s>  she was
pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very
rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had almost
resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss
bates turned to her again and seized her attention </s>
<s> 

my mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all </s>
<s>  by
only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over
she is sure to hear </s>
<s>  but then she is used to my voice </s>
<s>  but it is very
remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me </s>
<s> 
jane speaks so distinct </s>
<s>  however she will not find her grandmama at all
deafer than she was two years ago </s>
<s>  which is saying a great deal at my
mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years you know since
she was here </s>
<s>  we never were so long without seeing her before and as
i was telling <abvr> cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her
now </s>
<s> 

are you expecting miss fairfax here soon </s>
<s> 

oh yes </s>
<s>  next week </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> that must be a very great pleasure </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  you are very kind </s>
<s>  yes next week </s>
<s>  every body is so
surprized </s>
<s>  and every body says the same obliging things </s>
<s>  i am sure she
will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see
her </s>
<s>  yes friday or saturday </s>
<s>  she cannot say which because colonel
campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days </s>
<s>  so very
good of them to send her the whole way </s>
<s>  but they always do you know </s>
<s>  oh
yes friday or saturday next </s>
<s>  that is what she writes about </s>
<s>  that is
the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it </s>
<s>  for in the
common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or
wednesday </s>
<s> 

yes so i imagined </s>
<s>  i was afraid there could be little chance of my
hearing any thing of miss fairfax today </s>
<s> 

so obliging of you </s>
<s>  no we should not have heard if it had not been
for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon </s>
<s>  my
mother is so delighted </s>
<s> for she is to be three months with us at
least </s>
<s>  three months she says so positively as i am going to have the
pleasure of reading to you </s>
<s>  the case is you see that the campbells are
going to ireland </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come
over and see her directly </s>
<s>  they had not intended to go over till the
summer but she is so impatient to see them againfor till she married
last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must
make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say
but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter
to her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was but
we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in <abvr> dixons name as
well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would
give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country
seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy </s>
<s>  jane has heard a great
deal of its beauty </s>
<s>  from <abvr> dixon i meani do not know that she ever
heard about it from any body else </s>
<s>  but it was very natural you know
that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his
addressesand as jane used to be very often walking out with themfor
colonel and <abvr> campbell were very particular about their daughters
not walking out often with only <abvr> dixon for which i do not at all
blame them </s>
<s>  of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss
campbell about his own home in ireland </s>
<s>  and i think she wrote us word
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had
taken himself </s>
<s>  he is a most amiable charming young man i believe </s>
<s>  jane
was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things </s>
<s> 

at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmas
brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming <abvr> dixon and the
not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther
discovery

you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to
come to you at such a time </s>
<s>  considering the very particular friendship
between her and <abvr> dixon you could hardly have expected her to be
excused from accompanying colonel and <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 

very true very true indeed </s>
<s>  the very thing that we have always been
rather afraid of </s>
<s>  for we should not have liked to have her at such a
distance from us for months togethernot able to come if any thing was
to happen </s>
<s>  but you see every thing turns out for the best </s>
<s>  they want
her <abvr> and <abvr> dixon excessively to come over with colonel and <abvr>
campbell </s>
<s>  quite depend upon it </s>
<s>  nothing can be more kind or pressing
than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention </s>
<s>  he is
a most charming young man </s>
<s>  ever since the service he rendered jane at
weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the
sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have
been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he
had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit
i can never think of it without trembling </s>
<s> but ever since we had the
history of that day i have been so fond of <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing
ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and <abvr> bates </s>
<s> 

yesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice </s>
<s>  and colonel
and <abvr> campbell think she does quite right just what they should
recommend </s>
<s>  and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native
air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately </s>
<s> 

i am concerned to hear of it </s>
<s>  i think they judge wisely </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
dixon must be very much disappointed </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon i understand has
no remarkable degree of personal beauty </s>
<s>  is not by any means to be
compared with miss fairfax </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not </s>
<s> 
there is no comparison between them </s>
<s>  miss campbell always was absolutely
plainbut extremely elegant and amiable </s>
<s> 

yes that of course </s>
<s> 

jane caught a bad cold poor thing </s>
<s>  so long ago as the th of november
as i am going to read to you and has never been well since </s>
<s>  a long
time is not it for a cold to hang upon her </s>
<s>  she never mentioned
it before because she would not alarm us </s>
<s>  just like her </s>
<s>  so
considerate </s>
<s> but however she is so far from well that her kind
friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air
that always agrees with her </s>
<s>  and they have no doubt that three or four
months at highbury will entirely cure herand it is certainly a great
deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is
unwell </s>
<s>  nobody could nurse her as we should do </s>
<s> 

it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world </s>
<s> 

and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells
leave town in their way to holyhead the monday followingas you will
find from janes letter </s>
<s>  so sudden </s>
<s> you may guess dear miss woodhouse
what a flurry it has thrown me in </s>
<s>  if it was not for the drawback of
her illnessbut i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and
looking very poorly </s>
<s>  i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to
me as to that </s>
<s>  i always make a point of reading janes letters through
to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for
fear of there being any thing in them to distress her </s>
<s>  jane desired me
to do it so i always do </s>
<s>  and so i began today with my usual caution </s>
<s> 
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i
burst out quite frightened with òbless me </s>
<s>  poor jane is ill </s>
<s> which
my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed
at </s>
<s>  however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had
fancied at first </s>
<s>  and i make so light of it now to her that she does
not think much about it </s>

chapter ii


jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of <abvr> batess youngest
daughter </s>
<s> 

the marriage of lieut </s>
<s>  fairfax of the regiment of infantry
and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope
and interest </s>
<s>  but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy
remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under
consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl </s>
<s> 

by birth she belonged to highbury </s>
<s>  and when at three years old on
losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation
the foundling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every
probability of her being permanently fixed there </s>
<s>  of her being taught
only what very limited means could command and growing up with no
advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what
nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and
warmhearted wellmeaning relations </s>
<s> 

but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change
to her destiny </s>
<s>  this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded
fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man </s>
<s>  and
farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe
campfever as he believed had saved his life </s>
<s>  these were claims which
he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the
death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in
his power </s>
<s>  when he did return he sought out the child and took notice
of her </s>
<s>  he was a married man with only one living child a girl about
janes age </s>
<s>  and jane became their guest paying them long visits and
growing a favourite with all </s>
<s>  and before she was nine years old his
daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real
friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking
the whole charge of her education </s>
<s>  it was accepted </s>
<s>  and from that period
jane had belonged to colonel campbells family and had lived with them
entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time </s>
<s> 

the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others </s>
<s>  the
very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making
independence impossible </s>
<s>  to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel
campbells power </s>
<s>  for though his income by pay and appointments was
handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughters </s>
<s> 
but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of
respectable subsistence hereafter </s>
<s> 

such was jane fairfaxs history </s>
<s>  she had fallen into good hands known
nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent
education </s>
<s>  living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people
her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline
and culture </s>
<s>  and colonel campbells residence being in london every
lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of
firstrate masters </s>
<s>  her disposition and abilities were equally worthy
of all that friendship could do </s>
<s>  and at eighteen or nineteen she was
as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children
fully competent to the office of instruction herself </s>
<s>  but she was too
much beloved to be parted with </s>
<s>  neither father nor mother could promote
and the daughter could not endure it </s>
<s>  the evil day was put off </s>
<s>  it was
easy to decide that she was still too young </s>
<s>  and jane remained with
them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of
an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with
only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own
good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over </s>
<s> 

the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss
campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from
the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty and
acquirements </s>
<s>  that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen
by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the
parents </s>
<s>  they continued together with unabated regard however till the
marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often
defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is
moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of
mr </s>
<s>  dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were
acquainted </s>
<s>  and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had
yet her bread to earn </s>
<s> 

this event had very lately taken place </s>
<s>  too lately for any thing to be
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path
of duty </s>
<s>  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had
fixed on for beginning </s>
<s>  she had long resolved that oneandtwenty
should be the period </s>
<s>  with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had
resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from
all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace
and hope to penance and mortification for ever </s>
<s> 

the good sense of colonel and <abvr> campbell could not oppose such
a resolution though their feelings did </s>
<s>  as long as they lived no
exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever </s>
<s>  and for
their own comfort they would have retained her wholly </s>
<s>  but this would
be selfishness </s>
<s> what must be at last had better be soon </s>
<s>  perhaps they
began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the
temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments
of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished </s>
<s>  still however
affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying
on the wretched moment </s>
<s>  she had never been quite well since the time of
their daughters marriage </s>
<s>  and till she should have completely recovered
her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so
far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits
seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with
tolerable comfort </s>
<s> 

with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her
aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths
not told </s>
<s>  it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to
highbury </s>
<s>  to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with
those kind relations to whom she was so very dear </s>
<s>  and the campbells
whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or
treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they
depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery
of her health than on any thing else </s>
<s>  certain it was that she was to
come </s>
<s>  and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
had been so long promised itmr </s>
<s>  frank churchillmust put up for the
present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two
years absence </s>
<s> 

emma was sorry </s>
<s> to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like
through three long months </s>
<s> to be always doing more than she wished
and less than she ought </s>
<s>  why she did not like jane fairfax might be a
difficult question to answer </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had once told her it was
because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she
wanted to be thought herself </s>
<s>  and though the accusation had been eagerly
refuted at the time there were moments of selfexamination in which
her conscience could not quite acquit her </s>
<s>  but she could never get
acquainted with her </s>
<s>  she did not know how it was but there was such
coldness and reservesuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or
notand then her aunt was such an eternal talker </s>
<s> and she was made
such a fuss with by every body </s>
<s> and it had been always imagined that
they were to be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every
body had supposed they must be so fond of each other </s>
<s>  these were her
reasonsshe had no better </s>
<s> 

it was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified
by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any
considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her </s>
<s>  and
now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years
interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and
manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating </s>
<s>  jane
fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant </s>
<s>  and she had herself the
highest value for elegance </s>
<s>  her height was pretty just such as almost
every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall </s>
<s>  her
figure particularly graceful </s>
<s>  her size a most becoming medium between
fat and thin though a slight appearance of illhealth seemed to point
out the likeliest evil of the two </s>
<s>  emma could not but feel all this </s>
<s>  and
then her faceher featuresthere was more beauty in them altogether
than she had remembered </s>
<s>  it was not regular but it was very pleasing
beauty </s>
<s>  her eyes a deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had
never been denied their praise </s>
<s>  but the skin which she had been used to
cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really
needed no fuller bloom </s>
<s>  it was a style of beauty of which elegance was
the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her
principles admire it </s>
<s> elegance which whether of person or of mind
she saw so little in highbury </s>
<s>  there not to be vulgar was distinction
and merit </s>
<s> 

in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with
twofold complacency </s>
<s>  the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering
justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer </s>
<s>  when
she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty </s>
<s> 
when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was
going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible
to feel any thing but compassion and respect </s>
<s>  especially if to every
wellknown particular entitling her to interest were added the highly
probable circumstance of an attachment to <abvr> dixon which she had
so naturally started to herself </s>
<s>  in that case nothing could be more
pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on </s>
<s> 
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced <abvr> dixons
actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination
had suggested at first </s>
<s>  if it were love it might be simple single
successless love on her side alone </s>
<s>  she might have been unconsciously
sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her
friend </s>
<s>  and from the best the purest of motives might now be
denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself
effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of
laborious duty </s>
<s> 

upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings
as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence </s>
<s>  nobody that she
could wish to scheme about for her </s>
<s> 

these were charming feelingsbut not lasting </s>
<s>  before she had committed
herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax
or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than
saying to <abvr> knightley she certainly is handsome </s>
<s>  she is better than
handsome </s>
<s>  jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother
and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state </s>
<s> 
former provocations reappeared </s>
<s>  the aunt was as tiresome as ever </s>
<s>  more
tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration
of her powers </s>
<s>  and they had to listen to the description of exactly how
little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice
of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new
workbags for her mother and herself </s>
<s>  and janes offences rose again </s>
<s> 
they had music </s>
<s>  emma was obliged to play </s>
<s>  and the thanks and praise
which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an
air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very
superior performance </s>
<s>  she was besides which was the worst of all so
cold so cautious </s>
<s>  there was no getting at her real opinion </s>
<s>  wrapt up in
a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing </s>
<s>  she was
disgustingly was suspiciously reserved </s>
<s> 

if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on
the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing </s>
<s>  she seemed bent
on giving no real insight into <abvr> dixons character or her own value
for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match </s>
<s>  it was all
general approbation and smoothness </s>
<s>  nothing delineated or distinguished </s>
<s> 
it did her no service however </s>
<s>  her caution was thrown away </s>
<s>  emma saw
its artifice and returned to her first surmises </s>
<s>  there probably was
something more to conceal than her own preference </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixon perhaps
had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only
to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds </s>
<s> 

the like reserve prevailed on other topics </s>
<s>  she and <abvr> frank churchill
had been at weymouth at the same time </s>
<s>  it was known that they were a
little acquainted </s>
<s>  but not a syllable of real information could emma
procure as to what he truly was </s>
<s>  was he handsome </s>
<s> she believed
he was reckoned a very fine young man </s>
<s>  was he agreeable </s>
<s> he was
generally thought so </s>
<s>  did he appear a sensible young man </s>
<s>  a young
man of information </s>
<s> at a wateringplace or in a common london
acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points </s>
<s>  manners were
all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than
they had yet had of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  she believed every body found his
manners pleasing </s>
<s>  emma could not forgive her </s>
<s> 



chapter iii


emma could not forgive her </s>
<s> but as neither provocation nor resentment
were discerned by <abvr> knightley who had been of the party and had
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was
expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse his approbation of the whole </s>
<s>  not so openly as he might
have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough
to be very intelligible to emma </s>
<s>  he had been used to think her unjust to
jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement </s>
<s> 

a very pleasant evening he began as soon as <abvr> woodhouse had been
talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers
swept away </s>
<s> particularly pleasant </s>
<s>  you and miss fairfax gave us some
very good music </s>
<s>  i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting
at ones ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women </s>
<s> 
sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation </s>
<s>  i am sure miss
fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma </s>
<s>  you left nothing
undone </s>
<s>  i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument
at her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence </s>
<s> 

i am happy you approved said emma smiling </s>
<s>  but i hope i am not
often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield </s>
<s> 

no my dear said her father instantly </s>
<s>  that i am sure you are not </s>
<s> 
there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are </s>
<s>  if any thing
you are too attentive </s>
<s>  the muffin last nightif it had been handed
round once i think it would have been enough </s>
<s> 

no said <abvr> knightley nearly at the same time </s>
<s>  you are not often
deficient </s>
<s>  not often deficient either in manner or comprehension </s>
<s>  i
think you understand me therefore </s>
<s> 

an arch look expressedi understand you well enough </s>
<s>  but she said
only miss fairfax is reserved </s>
<s> 

i always told you she wasa little </s>
<s>  but you will soon overcome all
that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its
foundation in diffidence </s>
<s>  what arises from discretion must be honoured </s>
<s> 

you think her diffident </s>
<s>  i do not see it </s>
<s> 

my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her
you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant
evening </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions </s>
<s>  and
amused to think how little information i obtained </s>
<s> 

i am disappointed was his only answer </s>
<s> 

i hope every body had a pleasant evening said <abvr> woodhouse in his
quiet way </s>
<s>  i had </s>
<s>  once i felt the fire rather too much </s>
<s>  but then i
moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me </s>
<s> 
miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured as she always is though
she speaks rather too quick </s>
<s>  however she is very agreeable and <abvr>
bates too in a different way </s>
<s>  i like old friends </s>
<s>  and miss jane
fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a
very wellbehaved young lady indeed </s>
<s>  she must have found the evening
agreeable <abvr> knightley because she had emma </s>
<s> 

true sir </s>
<s>  and emma because she had miss fairfax </s>

emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the
present said and with a sincerity which no one could question

she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep ones eyes from </s>
<s> 
i am always watching her to admire </s>
<s>  and i do pity her from my heart </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to
express </s>
<s>  and before he could make any reply <abvr> woodhouse whose
thoughts were on the batess said

it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined </s>
<s>  a
great pity indeed </s>
<s>  and i have often wishedbut it is so little one can
venture to dosmall trifling presents of any thing uncommonnow we
have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg </s>
<s> 
it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is not like any other
porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma unless one could be sure
of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without
the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast
porki think we had better send the legdo not you think so my dear </s>
<s> 

my dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter </s>
<s>  i knew you would wish it </s>
<s> 
there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and
the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like </s>
<s> 

thats right my dear very right </s>
<s>  i had not thought of it before but
that is the best way </s>
<s>  they must not oversalt the leg </s>
<s>  and then if it
is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle
boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a
little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome </s>
<s> 

emma said <abvr> knightley presently i have a piece of news for you </s>

thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room </s>

morning to you </s>

emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while
he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marryand to
marry strangers tooand the other half she could give to her own view
of the subject </s>
<s>  it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece
of news as proving that <abvr> elton could not have suffered long </s>
<s>  but she
was sorry for harriet </s>
<s>  harriet must feel itand all that she could hope
was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing
it abruptly from others </s>
<s>  it was now about the time that she was likely
to call </s>
<s>  if she were to meet miss bates in her way </s>
<s> and upon its
beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would
be detaining her at <abvr> goddards and that the intelligence would
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation </s>
<s> 

the shower was heavy but short </s>
<s>  and it had not been over five minutes
when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give </s>
<s>  and the oh </s>
<s>  miss
woodhouse what do you think has happened </s>
<s>  which instantly burst forth
had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation </s>
<s>  as the blow was
given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in
listening </s>
<s>  and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to
tell </s>
<s>  she had set out from <abvr> goddards half an hour agoshe had
been afraid it would rainshe had been afraid it would pour down
every momentbut she thought she might get to hartfield firstshe
had hurried on as fast as possible </s>
<s>  but then as she was passing by the
house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she
would just step in and see how it went on </s>
<s>  and though she did not seem
to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain
and she did not know what to do </s>
<s>  so she ran on directly as fast as
she could and took shelter at fords </s>
<s> fords was the principal
woollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united </s>
<s>  the shop
first in size and fashion in the place </s>
<s> and so there she had
set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes
perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come into be sure it was
so very odd </s>
<s> but they always dealt at fordswho should come in but
elizabeth martin and her brother </s>
<s> dear miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  only think </s>
<s>  i
thought i should have fainted </s>
<s>  i did not know what to do </s>
<s>  i was sitting
near the doorelizabeth saw me directly </s>
<s>  but he did not </s>
<s>  he was busy
with the umbrella </s>
<s>  i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly
and took no notice </s>
<s>  and they both went to quite the farther end of the
shop </s>
<s>  and i kept sitting near the door </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  dear </s>
<s>  i was so miserable </s>
<s> 
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown </s>
<s>  i could not go away
you know because of the rain </s>
<s>  but i did so wish myself anywhere in the
world but there </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhousewell at last i fancy he
looked round and saw me </s>
<s>  for instead of going on with her buyings they
began whispering to one another </s>
<s>  i am sure they were talking of me </s>
<s>  and
i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to medo
you think he was miss woodhouse </s>
<s> for presently she came forwardcame
quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands
if i would </s>
<s>  she did not do any of it in the same way that she used </s>
<s>  i
could see she was altered </s>
<s>  but however she seemed to try to be very
friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time </s>
<s>  but i know no
more what i saidi was in such a tremble </s>
<s> i remember she said she
was sorry we never met now </s>
<s>  which i thought almost too kind </s>
<s>  dear miss
woodhouse i was absolutely miserable </s>
<s>  by that time it was beginning to
hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting
awayand thenonly think </s>
<s> i found he was coming up towards me
tooslowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do </s>
<s>  and
so he came and spoke and i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling
dreadfully you know one cant tell how </s>
<s>  and then i took courage and
said it did not rain and i must go </s>
<s>  and so off i set </s>
<s>  and i had not got
three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was
going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by <abvr> coles
stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> 
dear i thought it would have been the death of me </s>
<s>  so i said i was
very much obliged to him </s>
<s>  you know i could not do less </s>
<s>  and then he went
back to elizabeth and i came round by the stablesi believe i didbut
i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse
i would rather done any thing than have it happen </s>
<s>  and yet you know
there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and
so kindly </s>
<s>  and elizabeth too </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse do talk to me and
make me comfortable again </s>
<s> 

very sincerely did emma wish to do so </s>
<s>  but it was not immediately in
her power </s>
<s>  she was obliged to stop and think </s>
<s>  she was not thoroughly
comfortable herself </s>
<s>  the young mans conduct and his sisters seemed
the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them </s>
<s>  as harriet
described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection
and genuine delicacy in their behaviour </s>
<s>  but she had believed them to be
wellmeaning worthy people before </s>
<s>  and what difference did this make
in the evils of the connexion </s>
<s>  it was folly to be disturbed by it </s>
<s>  of
course he must be sorry to lose herthey must be all sorry </s>
<s>  ambition
as well as love had probably been mortified </s>
<s>  they might all have hoped
to rise by harriets acquaintance </s>
<s>  and besides what was the value of
harriets description </s>
<s> so easily pleasedso little discerning </s>
<s> what
signified her praise </s>
<s> 

she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering
all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt
on

it might be distressing for the moment said she </s>
<s>  but you seem to
have behaved extremely well </s>
<s>  and it is overand may nevercan never
as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about
it </s>
<s> 

harriet said very true and she would not think about it </s>
<s>  but still
she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else </s>
<s>  and emma at
last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry
on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution </s>
<s> 
hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only
amused at such a state of mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of
mr </s>
<s>  eltons importance with her </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  eltons rights however gradually revived </s>
<s>  though she did not feel
the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour
before its interest soon increased </s>
<s>  and before their first conversation
was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity
wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins
which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in
her fancy </s>
<s> 

emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting </s>
<s>  it
had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any
influence to alarm </s>
<s>  as harriet now lived the martins could not get
at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the
courage or the condescension to seek her </s>
<s>  for since her refusal of the
brother the sisters never had been at <abvr> goddards </s>
<s>  and a twelvemonth
might pass without their being thrown together again with any
necessity or even any power of speech </s>

chapter iv


human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting

a week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first mentioned in
highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have
every recommendation of person and mind </s>
<s>  to be handsome elegant highly
accomplished and perfectly amiable </s>
<s>  and when <abvr> elton himself arrived
to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits
there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian
name and say whose music she principally played </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton returned a very happy man </s>
<s>  he had gone away rejected and
mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what
appeared to him strong encouragement </s>

had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged to anotherand
to another as superior of course to the first as under such
circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost </s>
<s>  he came back gay
and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse
and defying miss smith </s>
<s> 

the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of
perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune
of so many thousands as would always be called ten </s>

dignity as well as some convenience </s>

thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of  l </s>
<s>  or thereabouts </s>
<s> 
and he had gained her with such delightful rapiditythe first hour of
introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice </s>
<s> 
the history which he had to give <abvr> cole of the rise and progress
of the affair was so gloriousthe steps so quick from the accidental
rencontre to the dinner at <abvr> greens and the party at <abvr>
brownssmiles and blushes rising in importancewith consciousness and
agitation richly scatteredthe lady had been so easily impressedso
sweetly disposedhad in short to use a most intelligible phrase
been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally
contented </s>

he had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection and
was just the happy man he ought to be </s>
<s>  talking only of himself and
his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed
atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young
ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more
cautiously gallant </s>

the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to
please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for </s>
<s>  and
when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which
a certain glance of <abvr> coles did not seem to contradict that when he
next entered highbury he would bring his bride </s>
<s> 

during his present short stay emma had barely seen him </s>
<s>  but just enough
to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression
of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now
spread over his air </s>
<s>  she was in fact beginning very much to wonder
that she had ever thought him pleasing at all </s>
<s>  and his sight was so
inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that
except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable
humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured
of never seeing him again </s>
<s>  she wished him very well </s>
<s>  but he gave
her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most
satisfaction </s>
<s> 

the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must
certainly be lessened by his marriage </s>
<s>  many vain solicitudes would be
preventedmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it </s>
<s>  a <abvr> elton would
be an excuse for any change of intercourse </s>
<s>  former intimacy might sink
without remark </s>
<s>  it would be almost beginning their life of civility
again </s>
<s> 

of the lady individually emma thought very little </s>
<s>  she was good enough
for <abvr> elton no doubt </s>
<s>  accomplished enough for highburyhandsome
enoughto look plain probably by harriets side </s>
<s>  as to connexion
there emma was perfectly easy </s>
<s>  persuaded that after all his own vaunted
claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing </s>
<s>  on that article
truth seemed attainable </s>
<s>  what she was must be uncertain </s>
<s>  but who
she was might be found out </s>
<s>  and setting aside the  l </s>
<s>  it did not
appear that she was at all harriets superior </s>
<s>  she brought no name no
blood no alliance </s>
<s>  miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters
of a bristolmerchant of course he must be called </s>
<s>  but as the whole
of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it
was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very
moderate also </s>
<s>  part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath </s>
<s> 
but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol </s>
<s>  for though the
father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remainedin the law
linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than
that he was in the law line </s>
<s>  and with him the daughter had lived </s>
<s>  emma
guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise </s>
<s> 
and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder
sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great
way near bristol who kept two carriages </s>
<s>  that was the windup of the
history </s>
<s>  that was the glory of miss hawkins </s>
<s> 

could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all </s>
<s>  she had
talked her into love </s>
<s>  but alas </s>
<s>  she was not so easily to be talked out
of it </s>
<s>  the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriets
mind was not to be talked away </s>

<s>  he
certainly would indeed </s>
<s>  nothing could be clearer </s>
<s>  even a robert martin
would have been sufficient </s>
<s>  but nothing else she feared would cure
her </s>
<s>  harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always
in love </s>
<s>  and now poor girl </s>
<s>  she was considerably worse from this
reappearance of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  she was always having a glimpse of him
somewhere or other </s>
<s>  emma saw him only once </s>
<s>  but two or three times every
day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him
just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something
occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of
surprize and conjecture </s>
<s>  she was moreover perpetually hearing about
him </s>
<s>  for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who
saw no fault in <abvr> elton and found nothing so interesting as
the discussion of his concerns </s>
<s>  and every report therefore every
guessall that had already occurred all that might occur in the
arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and
furniture was continually in agitation around her </s>
<s>  her regard was
receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept
alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss
hawkinss happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed
attached </s>
<s> his air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his
hat being all in proof of how much he was in love </s>
<s> 

had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her
friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriets mind
emma would have been amused by its variations </s>
<s>  sometimes <abvr> elton
predominated sometimes the martins </s>
<s>  and each was occasionally useful
as a check to the other </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons engagement had been the cure of
the agitation of meeting <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  the unhappiness produced by the
knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth
martins calling at <abvr> goddards a few days afterwards </s>
<s>  harriet had
not been at home </s>
<s>  but a note had been prepared and left for her written
in the very style to touch </s>
<s>  a small mixture of reproach with a great
deal of kindness </s>
<s>  and till <abvr> elton himself appeared she had been much
occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton in
person had driven away all such cares </s>
<s>  while he staid the martins were
forgotten </s>
<s>  and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again
emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best
for her to return elizabeth martins visit </s>
<s> 

how that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessaryand
what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration </s>
<s> 
absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would
be ingratitude </s>
<s>  it must not be </s>
<s>  and yet the danger of a renewal of the
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than
harriets returning the visit </s>
<s>  but in a way that if they had
understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal
acquaintance </s>
<s>  she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the
abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again
so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous
recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree
of intimacy was chosen for the future </s>
<s> 

she could think of nothing better </s>
<s>  and though there was something in it
which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude merely
glossed overit must be done or what would become of harriet </s>

chapter v


small heart had harriet for visiting </s>
<s>  only half an hour before her
friend called for her at <abvr> goddards her evil stars had led her
to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to the rev </s>
<s> 
philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the operation of
being lifted into the butchers cart which was to convey it to where
the coaches past </s>
<s>  and every thing in this world excepting that trunk
and the direction was consequently a blank </s>
<s> 

she went however </s>
<s>  and when they reached the farm and she was to be
put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between
espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every thing which
had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to
revive a little local agitation </s>
<s>  and when they parted emma observed her
to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined
her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour </s>
<s> 
she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who
was married and settled in donwell </s>
<s> 

the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again </s>
<s> 
and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and
unattended by any alarming young man </s>
<s>  she came solitarily down the
gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with
her seemingly with ceremonious civility </s>
<s> 

harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account </s>
<s>  she was
feeling too much </s>
<s>  but at last emma collected from her enough to
understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating </s>
<s> 
she had seen only <abvr> martin and the two girls </s>
<s>  they had received her
doubtingly if not coolly </s>
<s>  and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had
been talked almost all the timetill just at last when <abvr> martins
saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had
brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner </s>
<s>  in that very
room she had been measured last september with her two friends </s>
<s>  there
were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window </s>
<s> 
he had done it </s>
<s>  they all seemed to remember the day the hour
the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness the same
regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding </s>
<s>  and they
were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect
as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage
reappeared and all was over </s>
<s>  the style of the visit and the shortness
of it were then felt to be decisive </s>
<s>  fourteen minutes to be given
to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months
ago </s>
<s> emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might
resent how naturally harriet must suffer </s>
<s>  it was a bad business </s>
<s>  she
would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had
the martins in a higher rank of life </s>
<s>  they were so deserving that a
little higher should have been enough </s>
<s>  but as it was how could she
have done otherwise </s>
<s> impossible </s>
<s> she could not repent </s>
<s>  they must be
separated </s>
<s>  but there was a great deal of pain in the processso much
to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little
consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to
procure it </s>
<s>  her mind was quite sick of <abvr> elton and the martins </s>
<s>  the
refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary </s>
<s> 

it was a good scheme </s>
<s>  but on driving to the door they heard that neither
master nor mistress was at home </s>
<s>  they had both been out some time </s>
<s>  the
man believed they were gone to hartfield </s>
<s> 

this is too bad cried emma as they turned away </s>
<s>  and now we shall
just miss them </s>
<s>  too provoking </s>
<s> i do not know when i have been so
disappointed </s>
<s>  and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her
murmurs or to reason them away </s>
<s>  probably a little of bothsuch being
the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind </s>
<s>  presently the carriage
stopt </s>
<s>  she looked up </s>
<s>  it was stopt by <abvr> and <abvr> weston who were
standing to speak to her </s>
<s>  there was instant pleasure in the sight of
them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in soundfor <abvr> weston
immediately accosted her with

there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the
influence of such a happy face as <abvr> westons confirmed as it all was
by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not
less to the purpose </s>
<s>  to know that she thought his coming certain was
enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in
their joy </s>
<s>  it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits </s>
<s> 
the wornout past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming </s>
<s>  and in
the rapidity of half a moments thought she hoped <abvr> elton would now
be talked of no more </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which
allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command
as well as the route and the method of his journey </s>
<s>  and she listened
and smiled and congratulated </s>
<s> 

i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion </s>

<s> was a
question however which did not augur much </s>
<s> 

but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma
was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time </s>
<s> 

the morning of the interesting day arrived and <abvr> westons faithful
pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve oclock that
she was to think of her at four </s>

 the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall </s>

she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her
fathermr </s>
<s>  weston and his son </s>
<s>  they had been arrived only a few
minutes and <abvr> weston had scarcely finished his explanation of franks
being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his
very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her
share of surprize introduction and pleasure </s>
<s> 

the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually
before herhe was presented to her and she did not think too much had
been said in his praise </s>
<s>  he was a very good looking young man </s>

air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great
deal of the spirit and liveliness of his fathers </s>
<s>  he looked quick and
sensible </s>
<s>  she felt immediately that she should like him </s>
<s>  and there was
a wellbred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her
that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted
they soon must be </s>
<s> 

he had reached randalls the evening before </s>
<s>  she was pleased with the
eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel
earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day </s>
<s> 

i told you yesterday cried <abvr> weston with exultation i told you
all that he would be here before the time named </s>
<s>  i remembered what i
used to do myself </s>
<s>  one cannot creep upon a journey </s>

getting on faster than one has planned </s>

but in coming home i felt i might do any thing </s>
<s> 

the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency </s>
<s> 
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable </s>
<s>  the
conviction was strengthened by what followed </s>
<s>  he was very much pleased
with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly
allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to
highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself
to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but
ones own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it </s>
<s>  that
he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before
passed suspiciously through emmas brain </s>
<s>  but still if it were a
falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled </s>
<s>  his manner had
no air of study or exaggeration </s>
<s>  he did really look and speak as if in a
state of no common enjoyment </s>
<s> 

their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening
acquaintance </s>
<s>  on his side were the inquirieswas she a
horsewoman </s>
<s> pleasant rides </s>
<s> pleasant walks </s>
<s> had they a large
neighbourhood </s>
<s> highbury perhaps afforded society enough </s>
<s> there were
several very pretty houses in and about it </s>
<s> ballshad they balls </s>
<s> was
it a musical society </s>
<s> 

but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while
their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his
motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much
warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his
father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional
proof of his knowing how to pleaseand of his certainly thinking it
worth while to try to please her </s>
<s>  he did not advance a word of praise
beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  but
undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter </s>
<s>  he understood
what would be welcome </s>
<s>  he could be sure of little else </s>
<s>  his fathers
marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must
rejoice in it </s>
<s>  and the family from whom he had received such a blessing
must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on
him </s>
<s> 

he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it
was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses
character than miss woodhouse miss taylors </s>
<s>  and at last as if
resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its
object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of
her person </s>
<s> 

elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he </s>
<s>  but i
confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a
very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age </s>
<s>  i did not know that
i was to find a pretty young woman in <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

you cannot see too much perfection in <abvr> weston for my feelings
 said emma </s>
<s>  were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with
pleasure </s>
<s>  but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such
words </s>
<s>  dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty
young woman </s>
<s> 

i hope i should know better he replied </s>
<s>  no depend upon it with a
gallant bow that in addressing <abvr> weston i should understand whom
i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my
terms </s>
<s> 

emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from
their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind
had ever crossed his </s>
<s>  and whether his compliments were to be considered
as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance </s>
<s>  she must see more
of him to understand his ways </s>
<s>  at present she only felt they were
agreeable </s>
<s> 

she had no doubt of what <abvr> weston was often thinking about </s>
<s>  his quick
eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy
expression </s>
<s>  and even when he might have determined not to look she was
confident that he was often listening </s>
<s> 

her own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the
entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion
was a most comfortable circumstance </s>
<s>  happily he was not farther from
approving matrimony than from foreseeing it </s>
<s> though always objecting
to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from
the apprehension of any </s>
<s>  it seemed as if he could not think so ill of
any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it
were proved against them </s>
<s>  she blessed the favouring blindness </s>
<s>  he could
now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a
glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all
his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous inquiries after <abvr>
frank churchills accommodation on his journey through the sad evils
of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed
anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching coldwhich
however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till
after another night </s>
<s> 

a reasonable visit paid <abvr> weston began to move </s>
<s> he must be going </s>
<s> 
he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for
mrs </s>
<s>  weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else </s>
<s>  his son
too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying

as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity
of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore
may as well be paid now </s>
<s>  i have the honour of being acquainted with
a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near
highbury </s>
<s>  a family of the name of fairfax </s>
<s>  i shall have no difficulty
i suppose in finding the house </s>
<s>  though fairfax i believe is not

to be sure we do cried his father </s>

<s>  true true you are acquainted
with miss fairfax </s>

she is </s>
<s>  call upon her by all means </s>
<s> 

there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man </s>
<s> 
another day would do as well </s>
<s>  but there was that degree of acquaintance
at weymouth which

oh </s>
<s>  go today go today </s>
<s>  do not defer it </s>
<s>  what is right to be done
cannot be done too soon </s>
<s>  and besides i must give you a hint frank </s>
<s> 
any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided </s>
<s>  you saw
her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed
with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough
to live on </s>
<s>  if you do not call early it will be a slight </s>
<s> 

the son looked convinced </s>
<s> 

i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma </s>
<s>  she is a very
elegant young woman </s>
<s> 

he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to
doubt his real concurrence </s>
<s>  and yet there must be a very distinct sort
of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought
only ordinarily gifted with it </s>
<s> 

if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she
i think you will today </s>
<s>  you will see her to advantage </s>
<s>  see her and
hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an
aunt who never holds her tongue </s>
<s> 

you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation </s>
<s>  then give
me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young
lady </s>
<s>  she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very
worthy people </s>
<s>  i have known them all my life </s>
<s>  they will be extremely
glad to see you i am sure </s>

shew you the way </s>
<s> 

my dear sir upon no account in the world </s>
<s>  my father can direct me </s>
<s> 

but your father is not going so far </s>
<s>  he is only going to the crown
quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many
houses </s>
<s>  you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk
unless you keep on the footpath </s>
<s>  but my coachman can tell you where you
had best cross the street </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend
this is quite unnecessary </s>
<s>  frank knows a puddle of water when he sees
it and as to <abvr> batess he may get there from the crown in a hop
step and jump </s>
<s> 

they were permitted to go alone </s>
<s>  and with a cordial nod from one and a
graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave </s>
<s>  emma remained
very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now
engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full
confidence in their comfort </s>

chapter vi


the next morning brought <abvr> frank churchill again </s>
<s>  he came with <abvr>
weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially </s>
<s>  he had
been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till
her usual hour of exercise </s>
<s>  and on being desired to chuse their walk
immediately fixed on highbury </s>
<s> he did not doubt there being very
pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always
chuse the same </s>
<s>  highbury that airy cheerful happylooking highbury
would be his constant attraction </s>
<s> highbury with <abvr> weston stood
for hartfield </s>
<s>  and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with
him </s>
<s>  they walked thither directly </s>
<s> 

emma had hardly expected them </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston who had called in for
half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew
nothing of their plans </s>
<s>  and it was an agreeable surprize to her
therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in
arm </s>
<s>  she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in
company with <abvr> weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him
was to depend </s>
<s>  if he were deficient there nothing should make amends
for it </s>
<s>  but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied </s>
<s>  it
was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his
duty </s>
<s>  nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to
hernothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as
a friend and securing her affection </s>
<s>  and there was time enough for emma
to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of
the morning </s>
<s>  they were all three walking about together for an hour
or twofirst round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards
in highbury </s>
<s>  he was delighted with every thing </s>
<s>  admired hartfield
sufficiently for <abvr> woodhouses ear </s>
<s>  and when their going farther was
resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole
village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than
emma could have supposed </s>
<s> 

some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings </s>
<s>  he
begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and
which had been the home of his fathers father </s>
<s>  and on recollecting that
an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of
her cottage from one end of the street to the other </s>
<s>  and though in
some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they
shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general which must
be very like a merit to those he was with </s>
<s> 

emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it
could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting
himself </s>
<s>  that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of
insincere professions </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> knightley certainly had not done him
justice </s>
<s> 

their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though
the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of posthorses
were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any
run on the road </s>
<s>  and his companions had not expected to be detained by
any interest excited there </s>
<s>  but in passing it they gave the history of
the large room visibly added </s>
<s>  it had been built many years ago for
a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly
populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such </s>
<s> but such
brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for
which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established
among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place </s>
<s>  he was immediately
interested </s>
<s>  its character as a ballroom caught him </s>
<s>  and instead of
passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed
windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities
and lament that its original purpose should have ceased </s>
<s>  he saw no fault
in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested </s>
<s>  no it
was long enough broad enough handsome enough </s>
<s>  it would hold the
very number for comfort </s>
<s>  they ought to have balls there at least every
fortnight through the winter </s>
<s>  why had not miss woodhouse revived
the former good old days of the room </s>
<s> she who could do any thing in
highbury </s>
<s>  the want of proper families in the place and the conviction
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted
to attend were mentioned </s>
<s>  but he was not satisfied </s>
<s>  he could not be
persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw around him could
not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting </s>
<s>  and even when particulars
were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that
the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there
would be the smallest difficulty in every bodys returning into their
proper place the next morning </s>
<s>  he argued like a young man very much bent
on dancing </s>
<s>  and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of
the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills </s>
<s> 
he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social
inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of
enscombe </s>
<s>  of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough </s>
<s>  his
indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of
mind </s>
<s>  he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap </s>
<s> 
it was but an effusion of lively spirits </s>
<s> 

at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown </s>
<s> 
and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma
recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had
paid it </s>
<s> 

yes oh </s>
<s>  yeshe replied </s>
<s>  i was just going to mention it </s>
<s>  a very
successful visit </s>
<s> i saw all the three ladies </s>
<s>  and felt very much
obliged to you for your preparatory hint </s>
<s>  if the talking aunt had taken
me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me </s>
<s>  as it was i
was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit </s>
<s>  ten minutes
would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper </s>
<s>  and
i had told my father i should certainly be at home before himbut there
was no getting away no pause </s>
<s>  and to my utter astonishment i found
when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had
been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour </s>
<s> 
the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before </s>
<s> 

and how did you think miss fairfax looking </s>
<s> 

ill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look
ill </s>
<s>  but the expression is hardly admissible <abvr> weston is it </s>
<s>  ladies
can never look ill </s>
<s>  and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so
pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health </s>
<s> a most
deplorable want of complexion </s>
<s> 

emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfaxs
complexion </s>
<s>  it was certainly never brilliant but she would not
allow it to have a sickly hue in general </s>
<s>  and there was a softness and
delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of
her face </s>
<s>  he listened with all due deference </s>
<s>  acknowledged that he had
heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess that to him
nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health </s>
<s>  where
features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all </s>
<s> 
and where they were good the effect wasfortunately he need not
attempt to describe what the effect was </s>
<s> 

well said emma there is no disputing about taste </s>
<s> at least you
admire her except her complexion </s>
<s> 

he shook his head and laughed </s>
<s> i cannot separate miss fairfax and her
complexion </s>
<s> 

did you see her often at weymouth </s>
<s>  were you often in the same society </s>
<s> 

at this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed
ha </s>
<s>  this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of
their lives as my father informs me </s>
<s>  he comes to highbury himself he
says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords </s>
<s> 
if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove
myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury </s>
<s>  i must
buy something at fords </s>
<s>  it will be taking out my freedom </s>
<s> i dare say
they sell gloves </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes gloves and every thing </s>
<s>  i do admire your patriotism </s>
<s>  you will
be adored in highbury </s>
<s>  you were very popular before you came because
you were <abvr> westons sonbut lay out half a guinea at fords and your
popularity will stand upon your own virtues </s>
<s> 

they went in </s>
<s>  and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers
 and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he
saidbut i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me
you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor
patriae </s>
<s>  do not let me lose it </s>
<s>  i assure you the utmost stretch of
public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in
private life </s>
<s> 

i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her
party at weymouth </s>
<s> 

and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a
very unfair one </s>
<s>  it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree
of acquaintance </s>
<s>  miss fairfax must already have given her account </s>
<s> i
shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow </s>
<s> 

upon my word </s>
<s>  you answer as discreetly as she could do herself </s>
<s>  but
her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very
reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any
body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance
with her </s>
<s> 

may i indeed </s>
<s> then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so
well </s>
<s>  i met her frequently at weymouth </s>
<s>  i had known the campbells a
little in town </s>
<s>  and at weymouth we were very much in the same set </s>
<s> 
colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and <abvr> campbell a friendly
warmhearted woman </s>
<s>  i like them all </s>
<s> 

you know miss fairfaxs situation in life i conclude </s>
<s>  what she is
destined to be </s>
<s> 

yesrather hesitatinglyi believe i do </s>
<s> 

you get upon delicate subjects emma said <abvr> weston smiling </s>
<s> 
remember that i am here </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill hardly knows what to say
when you speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life </s>
<s>  i will move a little
farther off </s>
<s> 

i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend </s>
<s> 

he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment </s>
<s> 

when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did
you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play </s>
<s>  said frank
churchill </s>
<s> 

ever hear her </s>
<s>  repeated emma </s>
<s>  you forget how much she belongs to
highbury </s>
<s>  i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began </s>
<s> 
she plays charmingly </s>
<s> 

you think so do you </s>
<s> i wanted the opinion of some one who
could really judge </s>
<s>  she appeared to me to play well that is with
considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself </s>
<s> i am
excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right
of judging of any bodys performance </s>
<s> i have been used to hear hers
admired </s>
<s>  and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well </s>
<s> a
man a very musical man and in love with another womanengaged to
heron the point of marriagewould yet never ask that other woman
to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down
insteadnever seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other </s>
<s> 
that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof </s>
<s> 

proof indeed </s>
<s>  said emma highly amused </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  dixon is very musical
is he </s>
<s>  we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you
than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year </s>
<s> 

yes <abvr> dixon and miss campbell were the persons </s>
<s>  and i thought it a
very strong proof </s>
<s> 

certainlyvery strong it was </s>
<s>  to own the truth a great deal stronger
than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable
to me </s>
<s>  i could not excuse a mans having more music than lovemore ear
than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings </s>
<s> 
how did miss campbell appear to like it </s>
<s> 

it was her very particular friend you know </s>
<s> 

poor comfort </s>
<s>  said emma laughing </s>
<s>  one would rather have a stranger
preferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might
not recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend
always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself </s>
<s> poor
mrs </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s>  well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland </s>
<s> 

you are right </s>
<s>  it was not very flattering to miss campbell </s>
<s>  but she
really did not seem to feel it </s>
<s> 

so much the betteror so much the worse </s>
<s> i do not know which </s>
<s>  but
be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship or
dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have felt
it </s>
<s>  miss fairfax herself </s>
<s>  she must have felt the improper and dangerous
distinction </s>
<s> 

as to thati do not

oh </s>
<s>  do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs
sensations from you or from any body else </s>
<s>  they are known to no human
being i guess but herself </s>
<s>  but if she continued to play whenever she
was asked by <abvr> dixon one may guess what one chuses </s>
<s> 

there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all
 he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is
impossible for me to say on what terms they really werehow it might
all be behind the scenes </s>
<s>  i can only say that there was smoothness
outwardly </s>
<s>  but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be
a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct
herself in critical situations than i can be </s>
<s> 

i have known her from a child undoubtedly </s>
<s>  we have been children
and women together </s>
<s>  and it is natural to suppose that we should be
intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever she visited
her friends </s>
<s>  but we never did </s>
<s>  i hardly know how it has happened </s>
<s>  a
little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take
disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was
by her aunt and grandmother and all their set </s>
<s>  and then her reservei
never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved </s>
<s> 

it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he </s>
<s>  oftentimes very
convenient no doubt but never pleasing </s>
<s>  there is safety in reserve
but no attraction </s>
<s>  one cannot love a reserved person </s>
<s> 

not till the reserve ceases towards oneself </s>
<s>  and then the attraction
may be the greater </s>
<s>  but i must be more in want of a friend or an
agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of
conquering any bodys reserve to procure one </s>
<s>  intimacy between miss
fairfax and me is quite out of the question </s>
<s>  i have no reason to think
ill of hernot the leastexcept that such extreme and perpetual
cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea
about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to
conceal </s>
<s> 

he perfectly agreed with her </s>
<s>  and after walking together so long and
thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting </s>
<s>  he was
not exactly what she had expected </s>
<s>  less of the man of the world in some
of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better
than she had expected </s>
<s>  his ideas seemed more moderatehis feelings
warmer </s>
<s>  she was particularly struck by his manner of considering <abvr>
eltons house which as well as the church he would go and look at
and would not join them in finding much fault with </s>
<s>  no he could not
believe it a bad house </s>
<s>  not such a house as a man was to be pitied for
having </s>
<s>  if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not
think any man to be pitied for having that house </s>
<s>  there must be ample
room in it for every real comfort </s>
<s>  the man must be a blockhead who
wanted more </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about </s>
<s> 
used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no
judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one </s>
<s>  but emma
in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking
about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in
life and to marry from worthy motives </s>
<s>  he might not be aware of the
inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeepers room or
a bad butlers pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe
could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would
willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment </s>

chapter vii


emmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the
following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have
his hair cut </s>
<s>  a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and
he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner
but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut </s>
<s> 
there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over
on such an errand </s>
<s>  but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it
which she could not approve </s>
<s>  it did not accord with the rationality of
plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart
which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday </s>
<s>  vanity
extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be
doing something good or bad </s>
<s>  heedlessness as to the pleasure of his
father and <abvr> weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear
in general </s>
<s>  he became liable to all these charges </s>
<s>  his father only
called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story </s>
<s>  but that <abvr>
weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as
quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young
people would have their little whims </s>
<s> 

with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made
himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether </s>
<s>  he
appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful and
lively one </s>
<s>  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal
decidedly right </s>
<s>  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of
talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the world if he were
left to himself </s>
<s>  and though there was no being attached to the aunt he
acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to
speak of her with respect </s>
<s>  this was all very promising </s>
<s>  and but for
such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to
denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination
had given him </s>
<s>  the honour if not of being really in love with her
of being at least very near it and saved only by her own
indifferencefor still her resolution held of never marryingthe
honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint
acquaintance </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must
have some weight </s>
<s>  he gave her to understand that frank admired her
extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming </s>
<s>  and with so
much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him
harshly </s>
<s>  as <abvr> weston observed all young people would have their
little whims </s>
<s> 

there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so
leniently disposed </s>
<s>  in general he was judged throughout the parishes of
donwell and highbury with great candour </s>
<s>  liberal allowances were made
for the little excesses of such a handsome young manone who smiled so
often and bowed so well </s>
<s>  but there was one spirit among them not to be
softened from its power of censure by bows or smilesmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> 
the circumstance was told him at hartfield </s>
<s>  for the moment he was
silent </s>
<s>  but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself
over a newspaper he held in his hand hum </s>
<s>  just the trifling silly
fellow i took him for </s>
<s>  she had half a mind to resent </s>
<s>  but an instants
observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his
own feelings and not meant to provoke </s>
<s>  and therefore she let it pass </s>
<s> 

although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  westons visit this morning was in another respect particularly
opportune </s>
<s>  something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma
want their advice </s>
<s>  and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly
the advice they gave </s>
<s> 

this was the occurrence </s>
<s> the coles had been settled some years in
highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal and
unpretending </s>
<s>  but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade
and only moderately genteel </s>
<s>  on their first coming into the country
they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little
company and that little unexpensively </s>
<s>  but the last year or two had
brought them a considerable increase of meansthe house in town had
yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them </s>
<s>  with
their wealth their views increased </s>
<s>  their want of a larger house their
inclination for more company </s>
<s>  they added to their house to their number
of servants to their expenses of every sort </s>
<s>  and by this time were
in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield </s>
<s> 
their love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body
for their keeping dinnercompany </s>
<s>  and a few parties chiefly among the
single men had already taken place </s>
<s>  the regular and best families emma
could hardly suppose they would presume to inviteneither donwell nor
hartfield nor randalls </s>
<s>  nothing should tempt her to go if they did </s>
<s> 
and she regretted that her fathers known habits would be giving
her refusal less meaning than she could wish </s>
<s>  the coles were very
respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not
for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit
them </s>
<s>  this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from
herself </s>
<s>  she had little hope of <abvr> knightley none of <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks
before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her
very differently affected </s>
<s>  donwell and randalls had received their
invitation and none had come for her father and herself </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
westons accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the
liberty with you </s>
<s>  they know you do not dine out was not quite
sufficient </s>
<s>  she felt that she should like to have had the power of
refusal </s>
<s>  and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there
consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred
again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted
to accept </s>
<s>  harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses </s>
<s>  they
had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before
and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence </s>
<s>  might
not the evening end in a dance </s>
<s>  had been a question of his </s>
<s>  the bare
possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits </s>
<s>  and
her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be
intended as a compliment was but poor comfort </s>
<s> 

it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at
hartfield which made their presence so acceptable </s>
<s>  for though her first
remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so
very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their
advice for her going was most prompt and successful </s>
<s> 

she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely
without inclination for the party </s>
<s>  the coles expressed themselves so
properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of itso much
consideration for her father </s>
<s>  they would have solicited the honour
earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen from
london which they hoped might keep <abvr> woodhouse from any draught of
air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour
of his company </s>
<s>  upon the whole she was very persuadable </s>
<s>  and it being
briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting
his comforthow certainly <abvr> goddard if not <abvr> bates might be
depended on for bearing him companymr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was to be talked
into an acquiescence of his daughters going out to dinner on a day now
near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him </s>
<s>  as for his
going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be
too late and the party too numerous </s>
<s>  he was soon pretty well resigned </s>
<s> 

i am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was </s>
<s>  no more is
emma </s>
<s>  late hours do not agree with us </s>
<s>  i am sorry <abvr> and <abvr> cole
should have done it </s>
<s>  i think it would be much better if they would come
in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with ustake us
in their afternoon walk </s>
<s>  which they might do as our hours are so
reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the
evening </s>
<s>  the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any
body to </s>
<s>  however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine
with them and as you will both be there and <abvr> knightley too to take
care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what
it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy </s>
<s>  then turning to <abvr>
weston with a look of gentle reproachah </s>
<s>  miss taylor if you had not
married you would have staid at home with me </s>
<s> 

well sir cried <abvr> weston as i took miss taylor away it is
incumbent on me to supply her place if i can </s>
<s>  and i will step to <abvr>
goddard in a moment if you wish it </s>
<s> 

but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing
not lessening <abvr> woodhouses agitation </s>
<s>  the ladies knew better how
to allay it </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately
arranged </s>
<s> 

with this treatment <abvr> woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking
as usual </s>
<s>  he should be happy to see <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  he had a great regard
for <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  and emma should write a line and invite her </s>
<s>  james
could take the note </s>
<s>  but first of all there must be an answer written
to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible </s>
<s>  you will say
that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline
their obliging invitation </s>
<s>  beginning with my compliments of course </s>
<s> 
but you will do every thing right </s>
<s>  i need not tell you what is to be
done </s>
<s>  we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be
wanted on tuesday </s>
<s>  i shall have no fears for you with him </s>
<s>  we have never
been there above once since the new approach was made </s>
<s>  but still i have
no doubt that james will take you very safely </s>
<s>  and when you get there
you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again </s>
<s> 
and you had better name an early hour </s>
<s>  you will not like staying late </s>
<s> 
you will get very tired when tea is over </s>
<s> 

but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no my love </s>
<s>  but you will soon be tired </s>
<s>  there will be a great many
people talking at once </s>
<s>  you will not like the noise </s>
<s> 

but my dear sir cried <abvr> weston if emma comes away early it will
be breaking up the party </s>
<s> 

and no great harm if it does said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  the sooner every
party breaks up the better </s>
<s> 

but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles </s>
<s>  emmas going
away directly after tea might be giving offence </s>
<s>  they are goodnatured
people and think little of their own claims </s>
<s>  but still they must
feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment </s>
<s>  and miss
woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in
the room </s>
<s>  you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am
sure sir </s>
<s>  friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have
been your neighbours these ten years </s>
<s> 

no upon no account in the world <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i am much obliged to
you for reminding me </s>
<s>  i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any
pain </s>
<s>  i know what worthy people they are </s>
<s>  perry tells me that <abvr> cole
never touches malt liquor </s>
<s>  you would not think it to look at him but
he is biliousmr </s>
<s>  cole is very bilious </s>
<s>  no i would not be the means
of giving them any pain </s>
<s>  my dear emma we must consider this </s>
<s>  i am sure
rather than run the risk of hurting <abvr> and <abvr> cole you would stay a
little longer than you might wish </s>
<s>  you will not regard being tired </s>
<s>  you
will be perfectly safe you know among your friends </s>
<s> 

oh yes papa </s>
<s>  i have no fears at all for myself </s>
<s>  and i should have no
scruples of staying as late as <abvr> weston but on your account </s>
<s>  i am
only afraid of your sitting up for me </s>
<s>  i am not afraid of your not being
exceedingly comfortable with <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  she loves piquet you
know </s>
<s>  but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by
yourself instead of going to bed at your usual timeand the idea of
that would entirely destroy my comfort </s>
<s>  you must promise me not to sit
up </s>
<s> 

he did on the condition of some promises on her side </s>
<s>  such as that
if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly </s>
<s>  if
hungry that she would take something to eat </s>
<s>  that her own maid should
sit up for her </s>
<s>  and that serle and the butler should see that every
thing were safe in the house as usual </s>

chapter viii


frank churchill came back again </s>
<s>  and if he kept his fathers dinner
waiting it was not known at hartfield </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston was too anxious
for his being a favourite with <abvr> woodhouse to betray any imperfection
which could be concealed </s>
<s> 

he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very
good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had
done </s>
<s>  he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion
of face </s>
<s>  no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits </s>
<s> 
he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever </s>
<s>  and after seeing him
emma thus moralised to herself </s>
<s> 

i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent
way </s>
<s>  wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly </s>
<s> it
depends upon the character of those who handle it </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley he is
not a trifling silly young man </s>
<s>  if he were he would have done this
differently </s>
<s>  he would either have gloried in the achievement or
been ashamed of it </s>
<s>  there would have been either the ostentation of
a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own
vanities </s>
<s> no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly </s>
<s> 

with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for
a longer time than hitherto </s>
<s>  of judging of his general manners and by
inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself </s>
<s>  of guessing
how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air </s>
<s> 
and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were
now seeing them together for the first time </s>
<s> 

she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at <abvr>
coles </s>
<s>  and without being able to forget that among the failings of <abvr>
elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than
his propensity to dine with <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

her fathers comfort was amply secured <abvr> bates as well as <abvr>
goddard being able to come </s>
<s>  and her last pleasing duty before she left
the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after
dinner </s>
<s>  and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her
dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping
them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever
unwilling selfdenial his care of their constitution might have obliged
them to practise during the meal </s>
<s> she had provided a plentiful dinner
for them </s>
<s>  she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat
it </s>
<s> 

she followed another carriage to <abvr> coles door </s>
<s>  and was pleased to see
that it was <abvr> knightleys </s>
<s>  for <abvr> knightley keeping no horses
having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and
independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get about as he could
and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey </s>
<s> 
she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from
her heart for he stopped to hand her out </s>
<s> 

this is coming as you should do said she </s>
<s>  like a gentleman </s>
<s> i am
quite glad to see you </s>
<s> 

he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same
moment </s>
<s>  for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual </s>
<s> you
might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner </s>
<s> 

yes i should i am sure i should </s>
<s>  there is always a look of
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be
beneath them </s>
<s>  you think you carry it off very well i dare say but
with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern </s>
<s>  i always
observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances </s>
<s>  now you have
nothing to try for </s>
<s>  you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed </s>
<s>  you
are not striving to look taller than any body else </s>
<s>  now i shall really
be very happy to walk into the same room with you </s>
<s> 

nonsensical girl </s>
<s>  was his reply but not at all in anger </s>
<s> 

emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as
with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  she was received with a cordial respect which could
not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for </s>
<s> 
when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of
admiration were for her from both husband and wife </s>
<s>  the son approached
her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object
and at dinner she found him seated by herand as she firmly believed
not without some dexterity on his side </s>
<s> 

the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper
unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of
naming among their acquaintance and the male part of <abvr> coxs family
the lawyer of highbury </s>
<s>  the less worthy females were to come in the
evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith </s>
<s>  but already
at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be
general </s>
<s>  and while politics and <abvr> elton were talked over emma could
fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour </s>
<s> 
the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was
the name of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole seemed to be relating something of
her that was expected to be very interesting </s>
<s>  she listened and found
it well worth listening to </s>
<s>  that very dear part of emma her fancy
received an amusing supply </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole was telling that she had been
calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had
been struck by the sight of a pianofortea very elegant looking
instrumentnot a grand but a largesized square pianoforte </s>
<s>  and the
substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of
surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations
on miss batess was that this pianoforte had arrived from
broadwoods the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and
nieceentirely unexpected </s>
<s>  that at first by miss batess account
jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could
possibly have ordered itbut now they were both perfectly satisfied
that it could be from only one quarter </s>
<s> of course it must be from
colonel campbell </s>
<s> 

one can suppose nothing else added <abvr> cole and i was only
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt </s>
<s>  but jane it seems
had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it </s>
<s> 
she knows their ways best </s>
<s>  but i should not consider their silence as
any reason for their not meaning to make the present </s>
<s>  they might chuse
to surprize her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  cole had many to agree with her </s>
<s>  every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made </s>
<s>  and there were
enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still
listen to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me
more satisfaction </s>
<s> it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who
plays so delightfully should not have an instrument </s>
<s>  it seemed quite
a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine
instruments are absolutely thrown away </s>
<s>  this is like giving ourselves
a slap to be sure </s>
<s>  and it was but yesterday i was telling <abvr> cole
i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the
drawingroom while i do not know one note from another and our little
girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of
it </s>
<s>  and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not
any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old
spinet in the world to amuse herself with </s>
<s> i was saying this to
mr </s>
<s>  cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me </s>
<s>  only he is so
particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself
in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so
obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can </s>
<s>  and that
really is the reason why the instrument was boughtor else i am sure
we ought to be ashamed of it </s>
<s> we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse
may be prevailed with to try it this evening </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence </s>
<s>  and finding that nothing
more was to be entrapped from any communication of <abvr> coles turned
to frank churchill </s>
<s> 

why do you smile </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

nay why do you </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being so rich
and so liberal </s>
<s> it is a handsome present </s>
<s> 

very </s>
<s> 

i rather wonder that it was never made before </s>
<s> 

perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before </s>
<s> 

or that he did not give her the use of their own instrumentwhich must
now be shut up in london untouched by any body </s>
<s> 

that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for <abvr>
batess house </s>
<s> 

you may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies that your
thoughts on this subject are very much like mine </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s>  i rather believe you are giving me more credit for
acuteness than i deserve </s>
<s>  i smile because you smile and shall probably
suspect whatever i find you suspect </s>
<s>  but at present i do not see what
there is to question </s>
<s>  if colonel campbell is not the person who can
be </s>
<s> 

what do you say to <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s>  very true indeed </s>
<s>  i had not thought of <abvr> dixon </s>
<s>  she must
know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be </s>
<s>  and
perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young
womans scheme than an elderly mans </s>
<s>  it is <abvr> dixon i dare say </s>
<s>  i
told you that your suspicions would guide mine </s>
<s> 

if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend <abvr> dixon in
them </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  dixon </s>
<s> very well </s>
<s>  yes i immediately perceive that it must be the
joint present of <abvr> and <abvr> dixon </s>
<s>  we were speaking the other day you
know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance </s>
<s> 

yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had
entertained before </s>
<s> i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions
of either <abvr> dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either
that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune
to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little
attachment on her side </s>
<s>  one might guess twenty things without guessing
exactly the right </s>
<s>  but i am sure there must be a particular cause for
her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells
to ireland </s>
<s>  here she must be leading a life of privation and penance </s>
<s> 
there it would have been all enjoyment </s>
<s>  as to the pretence of trying her
native air i look upon that as a mere excuse </s>
<s> in the summer it might
have passed </s>
<s>  but what can any bodys native air do for them in the
months of january february and march </s>
<s>  good fires and carriages would
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare
say in hers </s>
<s>  i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though
you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what
they are </s>
<s> 

and upon my word they have an air of great probability </s>
<s>  <abvr> dixons
preference of her music to her friends i can answer for being very
decided </s>
<s> 

and then he saved her life </s>
<s>  did you ever hear of that </s>
<s> a water
party </s>
<s>  and by some accident she was falling overboard </s>
<s>  he caught her </s>
<s> 

he did </s>
<s>  i was thereone of the party </s>
<s> 

were you really </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> but you observed nothing of course for it
seems to be a new idea to you </s>
<s> if i had been there i think i should
have made some discoveries </s>
<s> 

i dare say you would </s>
<s>  but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that
miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that <abvr> dixon caught
her </s>
<s> it was the work of a moment </s>
<s>  and though the consequent shock and
alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i believe it was
half an hour before any of us were comfortable againyet that was too
general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be
observable </s>
<s>  i do not mean to say however that you might not have made
discoveries </s>
<s> 

the conversation was here interrupted </s>
<s>  they were called on to share
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and
obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others </s>
<s>  but when the table
was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly
right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said

the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me </s>
<s>  i wanted to know
a little more and this tells me quite enough </s>
<s>  depend upon it we shall
soon hear that it is a present from <abvr> and <abvr> dixon </s>
<s> 

and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must
conclude it to come from the campbells </s>
<s> 

no i am sure it is not from the campbells </s>
<s>  miss fairfax knows it is
not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first </s>
<s>  she
would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them </s>
<s>  i may not have
convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that <abvr>
dixon is a principal in the business </s>
<s> 

indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced </s>
<s>  your reasonings
carry my judgment along with them entirely </s>
<s>  at first while i supposed
you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as
paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world </s>
<s> 
but when you mentioned <abvr> dixon i felt how much more probable that it
should be the tribute of warm female friendship </s>
<s>  and now i can see it in
no other light than as an offering of love </s>
<s> 

there was no occasion to press the matter farther </s>
<s>  the conviction seemed
real </s>
<s>  he looked as if he felt it </s>
<s>  she said no more other subjects
took their turn </s>
<s>  and the rest of the dinner passed away </s>
<s>  the dessert
succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the
usual rate of conversation </s>
<s>  a few clever things said a few downright
silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the
othernothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news
and heavy jokes </s>
<s> 

the ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other
ladies in their different divisions arrived </s>
<s>  emma watched the entree
of her own particular little friend </s>
<s>  and if she could not exult in her
dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and
the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light
cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many
alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed
affection </s>
<s>  there she satand who would have guessed how many tears she
had been lately shedding </s>
<s>  to be in company nicely dressed herself and
seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say
nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour </s>
<s>  jane fairfax
did look and move superior </s>
<s>  but emma suspected she might have been
glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the
mortification of having lovedyes of having loved even <abvr> elton in
vainby the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself
beloved by the husband of her friend </s>
<s> 

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her </s>
<s> 
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the
secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair
and therefore purposely kept at a distance </s>
<s>  but by the others the
subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of
consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush
of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel
campbell </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested
by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her
perseverance in dwelling on the subject </s>
<s>  and having so much to ask and
to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish
of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the
fair heroines countenance </s>
<s> 

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen </s>
<s>  and the very first
of the early was frank churchill </s>
<s>  in he walked the first and the
handsomest </s>
<s>  and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates
and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle
where sat miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  and till he could find a seat by her would
not sit at all </s>
<s>  emma divined what every body present must be thinking </s>
<s> 
she was his object and every body must perceive it </s>
<s>  she introduced him
to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard
what each thought of the other </s>
<s>  he had never seen so lovely a face and
was delighted with her naivete </s>
<s>  and she only to be sure it was paying
him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a
little like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  emma restrained her indignation and only turned
from her in silence </s>
<s> 

smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first
glancing towards miss fairfax </s>
<s>  but it was most prudent to avoid speech </s>
<s> 
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroomhated
sitting longwas always the first to move when he couldthat his
father <abvr> knightley <abvr> cox and <abvr> cole were left very busy over
parish businessthat as long as he had staid however it had been
pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike
sensible men </s>
<s>  and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogetherthought it
so abundant in agreeable familiesthat emma began to feel she had been
used to despise the place rather too much </s>
<s>  she questioned him as to the
society in yorkshirethe extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe
and the sort </s>
<s>  and could make out from his answers that as far as
enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their
visitings were among a range of great families none very near </s>
<s>  and
that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even
chance that <abvr> churchill were not in health and spirits for going </s>
<s> 
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person </s>
<s>  and that though
he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without
considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce
an acquaintance for a night </s>
<s> 

she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at
its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at
home than he liked </s>
<s>  his importance at enscombe was very evident </s>
<s>  he did
not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his
aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing
it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could
with time persuade her to any thing </s>
<s>  one of those points on which
his influence failed he then mentioned </s>
<s>  he had wanted very much to
go abroadhad been very eager indeed to be allowed to travelbut she
would not hear of it </s>
<s>  this had happened the year before </s>
<s>  now he said
he was beginning to have no longer the same wish </s>
<s> 

the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be
good behaviour to his father </s>
<s> 

i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause </s>
<s> 
i have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time </s>
<s>  i never knew days fly
so fast </s>
<s>  a week tomorrow </s>
<s> and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself </s>
<s> 
but just got acquainted with <abvr> weston and others </s>
<s> i hate the
recollection </s>
<s> 

perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out
of so few in having your hair cut </s>
<s> 

no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all </s>
<s>  i have
no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be
seen </s>
<s> 

the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to <abvr> cole </s>
<s>  when
mr </s>
<s>  cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before
she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss
fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

he started </s>
<s>  thank you for rousing me he replied </s>
<s>  i believe i have
been very rude </s>
<s>  but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a
wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes from her </s>
<s>  i never saw
any thing so outree </s>
<s> those curls </s>
<s> this must be a fancy of her own </s>
<s>  i
see nobody else looking like her </s>
<s> i must go and ask her whether it
is an irish fashion </s>
<s>  shall i </s>
<s> yes i willi declare i willand you
shall see how she takes it </s>
<s> whether she colours </s>
<s> 

he was gone immediately </s>
<s>  and emma soon saw him standing before miss
fairfax and talking to her </s>
<s>  but as to its effect on the young lady
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in
front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing </s>
<s> 

before he could return to his chair it was taken by <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 

this is the luxury of a large party said she </s>
<s> one can get near
every body and say every thing </s>
<s>  my dear emma i am longing to talk
to you </s>
<s>  i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like
yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh </s>
<s>  do you know how
miss bates and her niece came here </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s> they were invited were not they </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesbut how they were conveyed hither </s>
<s> the manner of their
coming </s>
<s> 

they walked i conclude </s>
<s>  how else could they come </s>
<s> 

very true </s>
<s> well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and
cold as the nights are now </s>
<s>  and as i looked at her though i never saw
her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and
would therefore be particularly liable to take cold </s>
<s>  poor girl </s>
<s>  i could
not bear the idea of it </s>
<s>  so as soon as <abvr> weston came into the room
and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage </s>
<s>  you may guess
how readily he came into my wishes </s>
<s>  and having his approbation i made
my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be
at her service before it took us home </s>
<s>  for i thought it would be making
her comfortable at once </s>
<s>  good soul </s>
<s>  she was as grateful as possible you
may be sure </s>
<s>  ònobody was ever so fortunate as herself </s>
<s> but with many
many thanksòthere was no occasion to trouble us for <abvr> knightleys
carriage had brought and was to take them home again </s>
<s>  i was quite
surprized </s>
<s> very glad i am sure </s>
<s>  but really quite surprized </s>
<s>  such a
very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention </s>
<s> the sort of thing
that so few men would think of </s>
<s>  and in short from knowing his
usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their
accommodation the carriage was used at all </s>
<s>  i do suspect he would not
have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse
for assisting them </s>
<s> 

very likely said emmanothing more likely </s>
<s>  i know no man more
likely than <abvr> knightley to do the sort of thingto do any thing
really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent </s>
<s>  he is not a
gallant man but he is a very humane one </s>
<s>  and this considering jane
fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case of humanity to him </s>
<s> and for
an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on
more than on <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i know he had horses todayfor we arrived
together </s>
<s>  and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that
could betray </s>
<s> 

well said <abvr> weston smiling you give him credit for more simple
disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do </s>
<s>  for while miss
bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never
been able to get it out again </s>
<s>  the more i think of it the more probable
it appears </s>
<s>  in short i have made a match between <abvr> knightley and jane
fairfax </s>
<s>  see the consequence of keeping you company </s>
<s> what do you say to
it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley and jane fairfax </s>
<s>  exclaimed emma </s>
<s>  dear <abvr> weston how
could you think of such a thing </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley must not
marry </s>
<s> you would not have little henry cut out from donwell </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no
no henry must have donwell </s>
<s>  i cannot at all consent to <abvr> knightleys
marrying </s>
<s>  and i am sure it is not at all likely </s>
<s>  i am amazed that you
should think of such a thing </s>
<s> 

my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it </s>
<s>  i do not want
the matchi do not want to injure dear little henrybut the idea has
been given me by circumstances </s>
<s>  and if <abvr> knightley really wished to
marry you would not have him refrain on henrys account a boy of six
years old who knows nothing of the matter </s>
<s> 

yes i would </s>
<s>  i could not bear to have henry supplanted </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s> 
knightley marry </s>
<s> no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt
it now </s>
<s>  and jane fairfax too of all women </s>
<s> 

nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well
know </s>
<s> 

but the imprudence of such a match </s>
<s> 

i am not speaking of its prudence </s>
<s>  merely its probability </s>
<s> 

i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than
what you mention </s>
<s>  his goodnature his humanity as i tell you would
be quite enough to account for the horses </s>
<s>  he has a great regard for the
bateses you know independent of jane fairfaxand is always glad to
shew them attention </s>
<s>  my dear <abvr> weston do not take to matchmaking </s>
<s> 
you do it very ill </s>
<s>  jane fairfax mistress of the abbey </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no
no </s>
<s> every feeling revolts </s>
<s>  for his own sake i would not have him do so
mad a thing </s>
<s> 

imprudent if you pleasebut not mad </s>
<s>  excepting inequality of fortune
and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> knightley does not want to marry </s>
<s>  i am sure he has not the
least idea of it </s>
<s>  do not put it into his head </s>
<s>  why should he marry </s>
<s> he
is as happy as possible by himself </s>
<s>  with his farm and his sheep and
his library and all the parish to manage </s>
<s>  and he is extremely fond of
his brothers children </s>
<s>  he has no occasion to marry either to fill up
his time or his heart </s>
<s> 

my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so </s>
<s>  but if he really loves
jane fairfax

nonsense </s>
<s>  he does not care about jane fairfax </s>
<s>  in the way of love i am
sure he does not </s>
<s>  he would do any good to her or her family </s>
<s>  but

well said <abvr> weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could
do them would be to give jane such a respectable home </s>
<s> 

if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself </s>
<s>  a
very shameful and degrading connexion </s>
<s>  how would he bear to have miss
bates belonging to him </s>
<s> to have her haunting the abbey and thanking
him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane </s>
<s> òso very
kind and obliging </s>
<s> but he always had been such a very kind neighbour </s>
<s> 
and then fly off through half a sentence to her mothers old
petticoat </s>
<s>  ònot that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still
it would last a great whileand indeed she must thankfully say that
their petticoats were all very strong </s>
<s> 

for shame emma </s>
<s>  do not mimic her </s>
<s>  you divert me against my conscience </s>
<s> 
and upon my word i do not think <abvr> knightley would be much disturbed
by miss bates </s>
<s>  little things do not irritate him </s>
<s>  she might talk on </s>
<s>  and
if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and
drown her voice </s>
<s>  but the question is not whether it would be a bad
connexion for him but whether he wishes it </s>
<s>  and i think he does </s>
<s>  i have
heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax </s>
<s>  the
interest he takes in herhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that
she should have no happier prospect </s>
<s>  i have heard him express himself
so warmly on those points </s>
<s> such an admirer of her performance on the
pianoforte and of her voice </s>
<s>  i have heard him say that he could listen
to her for ever </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred
to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebodythough
we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the
campbells may it not be from <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i cannot help suspecting
him </s>
<s>  i think he is just the person to do it even without being in
love </s>
<s> 

then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love </s>
<s>  but i do not
think it is at all a likely thing for him to do </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley does
nothing mysteriously </s>
<s> 

i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly </s>
<s>  oftener
than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of
things occur to him </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  and if he had intended to give her one he would have told
her so </s>
<s> 

there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma </s>
<s>  i have a very strong
notion that it comes from him </s>
<s>  i am sure he was particularly silent when
mrs </s>
<s>  cole told us of it at dinner </s>
<s> 

you take up an idea <abvr> weston and run away with it </s>
<s>  as you have
many a time reproached me with doing </s>
<s>  i see no sign of attachmenti
believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince me that
mr </s>
<s>  knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

they combated the point some time longer in the same way </s>
<s>  emma rather
gaining ground over the mind of her friend </s>
<s>  for <abvr> weston was the most
used of the two to yield </s>
<s>  till a little bustle in the room shewed them
that tea was over and the instrument in preparation </s>
<s> and at the same
moment <abvr> cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the
honour of trying it </s>
<s>  frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her
conversation with <abvr> weston she had been seeing nothing except that
he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed <abvr> cole to add his very
pressing entreaties </s>
<s>  and as in every respect it suited emma best to
lead she gave a very proper compliance </s>
<s> 

she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than
she could perform with credit </s>
<s>  she wanted neither taste nor spirit in
the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany
her own voice well </s>
<s>  one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by
surprizea second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill </s>
<s>  her
pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual
followed </s>
<s>  he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect
knowledge of music </s>
<s>  which was properly denied </s>
<s>  and that he knew nothing
of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted </s>
<s>  they sang
together once more </s>
<s>  and emma would then resign her place to miss
fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could
attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own </s>
<s> 

with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the
numbers round the instrument to listen </s>
<s>  frank churchill sang again </s>
<s> 
they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth </s>
<s>  but the
sight of <abvr> knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half
emmas mind </s>
<s>  and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of
mrs </s>
<s>  westons suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices
gave only momentary interruptions </s>
<s>  her objections to <abvr> knightleys
marrying did not in the least subside </s>
<s>  she could see nothing but evil
in it </s>
<s>  it would be a great disappointment to <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> 
consequently to isabella </s>
<s>  a real injury to the childrena most
mortifying change and material loss to them all </s>
<s> a very great
deduction from her fathers daily comfortand as to herself she could
not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey </s>
<s>  a <abvr>
knightley for them all to give way to </s>
<s> nomr </s>
<s>  knightley must never
marry </s>
<s>  little henry must remain the heir of donwell </s>
<s> 

presently <abvr> knightley looked back and came and sat down by her </s>
<s>  they
talked at first only of the performance </s>
<s>  his admiration was certainly
very warm </s>
<s>  yet she thought but for <abvr> weston it would not have
struck her </s>
<s>  as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his
kindness in conveying the aunt and niece </s>
<s>  and though his answer was in
the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only
his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own </s>
<s> 

i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage
more useful on such occasions </s>
<s>  it is not that i am without the wish </s>
<s>  but
you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should putto
for such a purpose </s>
<s> 

quite out of the question quite out of the question he
replied </s>
<s> but you must often wish it i am sure </s>
<s>  and he smiled with
such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another
step </s>
<s> 

this present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte is very
kindly given </s>
<s> 

yes he replied and without the smallest apparent
embarrassment </s>
<s> but they would have done better had they given
her notice of it </s>
<s>  surprizes are foolish things </s>
<s>  the pleasure is not
enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable </s>
<s>  i should have
expected better judgment in colonel campbell </s>
<s> 

from that moment emma could have taken her oath that <abvr> knightley had
had no concern in giving the instrument </s>
<s>  but whether he were
entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual
preferenceremained a little longer doubtful </s>
<s>  towards the end of janes
second song her voice grew thick </s>
<s> 

that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloudyou have
sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet </s>
<s> 

another song however was soon begged for </s>
<s>  one more </s>
<s> they would not
fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more </s>
<s> 
 and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this
without effort </s>
<s>  the first part is so very trifling </s>
<s>  the strength of the
song falls on the second </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley grew angry </s>
<s> 

that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off
his own voice </s>
<s>  this must not be </s>
<s>  and touching miss bates who at that
moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let your niece sing
herself hoarse in this manner </s>
<s>  go and interfere </s>
<s>  they have no mercy on
her </s>
<s> 

miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to
be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther
singing </s>
<s>  here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse
and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers </s>
<s>  but soon within
five minutes the proposal of dancingoriginating nobody exactly knew
wherewas so effectually promoted by <abvr> and <abvr> cole that every
thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
capital in her countrydances was seated and beginning an irresistible
waltz </s>
<s>  and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to
emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top </s>
<s> 

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off
emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on
her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s>  this would be a trial </s>
<s>  he was no dancer in general </s>
<s>  if he
were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur
something </s>
<s>  there was no immediate appearance </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  he was talking to <abvr>
colehe was looking on unconcerned </s>
<s>  jane was asked by somebody else
and he was still talking to <abvr> cole </s>
<s> 

emma had no longer an alarm for henry </s>
<s>  his interest was yet safe </s>
<s>  and
she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment </s>
<s>  not more than
five couple could be mustered </s>
<s>  but the rarity and the suddenness of
it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a
partner </s>
<s>  they were a couple worth looking at </s>
<s> 

two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed </s>
<s>  it was
growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mothers
account </s>
<s>  after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again
they were obliged to thank <abvr> weston look sorrowful and have done </s>
<s> 

perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to
her carriage </s>
<s>  i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing
would not have agreed with me after yours </s>
<s> 



chapter ix


emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles </s>
<s>  the visit
afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day </s>
<s>  and all that she
might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must
be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity </s>
<s>  she must have delighted
the colesworthy people who deserved to be made happy </s>
<s> and left a
name behind her that would not soon die away </s>
<s> 

perfect happiness even in memory is not common </s>
<s>  and there were two
points on which she was not quite easy </s>
<s>  she doubted whether she had not
transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of
jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill </s>
<s>  it was hardly right </s>
<s>  but it
had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission
to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made
it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her
tongue </s>
<s> 

the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and
there she had no doubt </s>
<s>  she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the
inferiority of her own playing and singing </s>
<s>  she did most heartily
grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised
vigorously an hour and a half </s>
<s> 

she was then interrupted by harriets coming in </s>
<s>  and if harriets praise
could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax </s>
<s> 

dont class us together harriet </s>
<s>  my playing is no more like hers
than a lamp is like sunshine </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  deari think you play the best of the two </s>
<s>  i think you play quite
as well as she does </s>
<s>  i am sure i had much rather hear you </s>
<s>  every body
last night said how well you played </s>
<s> 

those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference </s>
<s>  the
truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised
but jane fairfaxs is much beyond it </s>
<s> 

well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or
that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole
said how much taste you had </s>
<s>  and <abvr> frank churchill talked a great deal
about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  but jane fairfax has them both harriet </s>
<s> 

are you sure </s>
<s>  i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any
taste </s>
<s>  nobody talked about it </s>
<s>  and i hate italian singing </s>
<s> there is no
understanding a word of it </s>
<s>  besides if she does play so very well you
know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to
teach </s>
<s>  the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into
any great family </s>
<s>  how did you think the coxes looked </s>
<s> 

just as they always dovery vulgar </s>
<s> 

they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly </s>
<s>  but it is
nothing of any consequence </s>
<s> 

emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its
producing <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

they told methat <abvr> martin dined with them last saturday </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s> 

he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to
dinner </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s> 

they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox </s>
<s>  i do not know
what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there
again next summer </s>
<s> 

she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should
be </s>
<s> 

she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there </s>
<s>  he sat by her at
dinner </s>
<s>  miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry
him </s>
<s> 

very likely </s>
<s> i think they are without exception the most vulgar
girls in highbury </s>
<s> 

harriet had business at fords </s>
<s> emma thought it most prudent to go with
her </s>
<s>  another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in
her present state would be dangerous </s>
<s> 

harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always
very long at a purchase </s>
<s>  and while she was still hanging over muslins
and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement </s>
<s> much could
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury </s>
<s> <abvr>
perry walking hastily by <abvr> william cox letting himself in at the
officedoor <abvr> coles carriagehorses returning from exercise or a
stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she
could presume to expect </s>
<s>  and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with
his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full
basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling
children round the bakers little bowwindow eyeing the gingerbread she
knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough </s>
<s>  quite enough
still to stand at the door </s>
<s>  a mind lively and at ease can do with
seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer </s>
<s> 

she looked down the randalls road </s>
<s>  the scene enlarged </s>
<s>  two persons
appeared </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston and her soninlaw </s>
<s>  they were walking into
highbury </s>
<s> to hartfield of course </s>
<s>  they were stopping however in the
first place at <abvr> batess </s>
<s>  whose house was a little nearer
randalls than fords </s>
<s>  and had all but knocked when emma caught their
eye </s>
<s> immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her </s>
<s>  and the
agreeableness of yesterdays engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to
the present meeting </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston informed her that she was going to call
on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument </s>
<s> 

for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss
bates last night that i would come this morning </s>
<s>  i was not aware of it
myself </s>
<s>  i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i
am going now </s>
<s> 

and while <abvr> weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said
frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfieldif
you are going home </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was disappointed </s>
<s> 

i thought you meant to go with me </s>
<s>  they would be very much pleased </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  i should be quite in the way </s>
<s>  but perhapsi may be equally in the
way here </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me </s>
<s>  my aunt always
sends me off when she is shopping </s>
<s>  she says i fidget her to death </s>
<s>  and
miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same </s>
<s>  what am i to
do </s>
<s> 

i am here on no business of my own said emma </s>
<s>  i am only waiting for
my friend </s>
<s>  she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home </s>
<s> 
but you had better go with <abvr> weston and hear the instrument </s>
<s> 

wellif you advise it </s>
<s> but with a smile if colonel campbell should
have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an
indifferent tonewhat shall i say </s>
<s>  i shall be no support to <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  she might do very well by herself </s>
<s>  a disagreeable truth would be
palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world
at a civil falsehood </s>
<s> 

i do not believe any such thing replied emma </s>
<s> i am persuaded that
you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary </s>
<s>  but
there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent </s>
<s>  quite
otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion last night </s>
<s> 

do come with me said <abvr> weston if it be not very disagreeable to
you </s>
<s>  it need not detain us long </s>
<s>  we will go to hartfield afterwards </s>
<s> 
we will follow them to hartfield </s>
<s>  i really wish you to call with me </s>
<s>  it
will be felt so great an attention </s>
<s>  and i always thought you meant it </s>
<s> 

he could say no more </s>
<s>  and with the hope of hartfield to reward him
returned with <abvr> weston to <abvr> batess door </s>
<s>  emma watched them in
and then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all
the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain
muslin it was of no use to look at figured </s>
<s>  and that a blue ribbon be
it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern </s>
<s>  at
last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel </s>
<s> 

should i send it to <abvr> goddards maam </s>
<s>  asked <abvr>
ford </s>
<s> yesnoyes to <abvr> goddards </s>
<s>  only my pattern gown is at
hartfield </s>
<s>  no you shall send it to hartfield if you please </s>
<s>  but then
mrs </s>
<s>  goddard will want to see it </s>
<s> and i could take the pattern gown
home any day </s>
<s>  but i shall want the ribbon directlyso it had better go
to hartfieldat least the ribbon </s>
<s>  you could make it into two parcels
mrs </s>
<s>  ford could not you </s>
<s> 

it is not worth while harriet to give <abvr> ford the trouble of two
parcels </s>
<s> 

no more it is </s>
<s> 

no trouble in the world maam said the obliging <abvr> ford </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but indeed i would much rather have it only in one </s>
<s>  then if you
please you shall send it all to <abvr> goddardsi do not knowno i
think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and
take it home with me at night </s>
<s>  what do you advise </s>
<s> 

that you do not give another halfsecond to the subject </s>
<s>  to hartfield
if you please <abvr> ford </s>
<s> 

aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should
not at all like to have it sent to <abvr> goddards </s>
<s> 

voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston and miss bates met them at the door </s>
<s> 

my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while
and give us your opinion of our new instrument </s>
<s>  you and miss smith </s>
<s>  how
do you do miss smith </s>
<s> very well i thank you </s>
<s> and i begged <abvr> weston
to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding </s>
<s> 

i hope <abvr> bates and miss fairfax are

very well i am much obliged to you </s>
<s>  my mother is delightfully well </s>
<s> 
and jane caught no cold last night </s>
<s>  how is <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s> i am so glad
to hear such a good account </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston told me you were here </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> 
then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me
just to run across and entreat her to come in </s>
<s>  my mother will be so
very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party she cannot
refuse </s>
<s> òaye pray do said <abvr> frank churchill òmiss woodhouses
opinion of the instrument will be worth having </s>
<s> but said i i shall
be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me </s>
<s> òoh said
he òwait half a minute till i have finished my job </s>
<s> for would you
believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in
the world fastening in the rivet of my mothers spectacles </s>
<s> the rivet
came out you know this morning </s>
<s> so very obliging </s>
<s> for my mother had
no use of her spectaclescould not put them on </s>
<s>  and by the bye every
body ought to have two pair of spectacles </s>
<s>  they should indeed </s>
<s>  jane said
so </s>
<s>  i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did
but something or other hindered me all the morning </s>
<s>  first one thing
then another there is no saying what you know </s>
<s>  at one time patty came
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping </s>
<s>  oh said i
patty do not come with your bad news to me </s>
<s>  here is the rivet of your
mistresss spectacles out </s>
<s>  then the baked apples came home <abvr> wallis
sent them by her boy </s>
<s>  they are extremely civil and obliging to us the
wallises alwaysi have heard some people say that <abvr> wallis can be
uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing
but the greatest attention from them </s>
<s>  and it cannot be for the value
of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know </s>
<s> 
only three of us </s>
<s> besides dear jane at presentand she really eats
nothingmakes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened
if you saw it </s>
<s>  i dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i
say one thing and then i say another and it passes off </s>
<s>  but about the
middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so
well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took
the opportunity the other day of asking <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  i happened to meet
him in the street </s>
<s>  not that i had any doubt beforei have so often
heard <abvr> woodhouse recommend a baked apple </s>
<s>  i believe it is the only
way that <abvr> woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome </s>
<s>  we
have appledumplings however very often </s>
<s>  patty makes an excellent
appledumpling </s>
<s>  well <abvr> weston you have prevailed i hope and these
ladies will oblige us </s>
<s> 

emma would be very happy to wait on <abvr> bates &c </s>
<s>  and they did at
last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than

how do you do <abvr> ford </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon </s>
<s>  i did not see you before </s>
<s> 
i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town </s>
<s>  jane
came back delighted yesterday </s>
<s>  thank ye the gloves do very wellonly a
little too large about the wrist </s>
<s>  but jane is taking them in </s>
<s> 

what was i talking of </s>
<s>  said she beginning again when they were all in
the street </s>
<s> 

emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix </s>
<s> 

i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  my mothers
spectacles </s>
<s>  so very obliging of <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  òoh </s>
<s>  said he
òi do think i can fasten the rivet </s>
<s>  i like a job of this kind
excessively </s>
<s> which you know shewed him to be so very </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  indeed i must
say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected
he very far exceeds any thing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

most warmly </s>
<s>  he seems every thing the fondest parent could </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
òoh </s>
<s>  said he òi can fasten the rivet </s>
<s>  i like a job of that sort
excessively </s>
<s>  i never shall forget his manner </s>
<s>  and when i brought out
the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very
obliging as to take some òoh </s>
<s>  said he directly òthere is nothing
in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finestlooking
homebaked apples i ever saw in my life </s>
<s>  that you know was so
very </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment </s>
<s>  indeed they
are very delightful apples and <abvr> wallis does them full justiceonly
we do not have them baked more than twice and <abvr> woodhouse made us
promise to have them done three timesbut miss woodhouse will be so
good as not to mention it </s>
<s>  the apples themselves are the very finest
sort for baking beyond a doubt </s>
<s>  all from donwellsome of <abvr>
knightleys most liberal supply </s>
<s>  he sends us a sack every year </s>
<s>  and
certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his
treesi believe there is two of them </s>
<s>  my mother says the orchard was
always famous in her younger days </s>
<s>  but i was really quite shocked the
other dayfor <abvr> knightley called one morning and jane was eating
these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed
them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock </s>
<s>  òi
am sure you must be said he òand i will send you another supply </s>
<s>  for
i have a great many more than i can ever use </s>
<s>  william larkins let me
keep a larger quantity than usual this year </s>
<s>  i will send you some more
before they get good for nothing </s>
<s>  so i begged he would notfor really
as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great
many leftit was but half a dozen indeed </s>
<s>  but they should be all kept
for jane </s>
<s>  and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more
so liberal as he had been already </s>
<s>  and jane said the same </s>
<s>  and when
he was gone she almost quarrelled with meno i should not say
quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives </s>
<s>  but she was quite
distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone </s>
<s>  she wished
i had made him believe we had a great many left </s>
<s>  oh said i my dear
i did say as much as i could </s>
<s>  however the very same evening william
larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of
apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down
and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose </s>
<s> 
william larkins is such an old acquaintance </s>
<s>  i am always glad to see
him </s>
<s>  but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it
was all the apples of that sort his master had </s>
<s>  he had brought them
alland now his master had not one left to bake or boil </s>
<s>  william did
not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had
sold so many </s>
<s>  for william you know thinks more of his masters profit
than any thing </s>
<s>  but <abvr> hodges he said was quite displeased at their
being all sent away </s>
<s>  she could not bear that her master should not be
able to have another appletart this spring </s>
<s>  he told patty this but bid
her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for
mrs </s>
<s>  hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks
were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder </s>
<s>  and so patty told
me and i was excessively shocked indeed </s>
<s>  i would not have <abvr> knightley
know any thing about it for the world </s>
<s>  he would be so very </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  i wanted
to keep it from janes knowledge </s>
<s>  but unluckily i had mentioned it
before i was aware </s>
<s> 

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door </s>
<s>  and her visitors
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to
pursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill </s>
<s> 

pray take care <abvr> weston there is a step at the turning </s>
<s>  pray take

chapter x


the appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered was
tranquillity itself </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates deprived of her usual employment
slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near
her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax
standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte </s>
<s> 

busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy
countenance on seeing emma again </s>
<s> 

this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least
ten minutes earlier than i had calculated </s>
<s>  you find me trying to be
useful </s>
<s>  tell me if you think i shall succeed </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston have not you finished it yet </s>
<s>  you would not
earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate </s>
<s> 

i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been
assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily
it was not quite firm </s>
<s>  an unevenness in the floor i believe </s>
<s>  you see
we have been wedging one leg with paper </s>
<s>  this was very kind of you to be
persuaded to come </s>
<s>  i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home </s>
<s> 

he contrived that she should be seated by him </s>
<s>  and was sufficiently
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make
her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready
to sit down to the pianoforte again </s>
<s>  that she was not immediately ready
emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves </s>
<s>  she had not yet
possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion </s>
<s>  she
must reason herself into the power of performance </s>
<s>  and emma could not
but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve
never to expose them to her neighbour again </s>
<s> 

at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the
powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston had been delighted before and was delighted again </s>
<s>  emma
joined her in all her praise </s>
<s>  and the pianoforte with every proper
discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise </s>
<s> 

whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a
smile at emma the person has not chosen ill </s>
<s>  i heard a good deal of
colonel campbells taste at weymouth </s>
<s>  and the softness of the upper
notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would
particularly prize </s>
<s>  i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his
friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself </s>
<s>  do not you
think so </s>
<s> 

jane did not look round </s>
<s>  she was not obliged to hear </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had
been speaking to her at the same moment </s>
<s> 

it is not fair said emma in a whisper </s>
<s>  mine was a random guess </s>
<s>  do
not distress her </s>
<s> 

he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little
doubt and very little mercy </s>
<s>  soon afterwards he began again

how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this
occasion miss fairfax </s>
<s>  i dare say they often think of you and wonder
which will be the day the precise day of the instruments coming to
hand </s>
<s>  do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going
forward just at this time </s>
<s> do you imagine it to be the consequence
of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only
a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon
contingencies and conveniences </s>
<s> 

he paused </s>
<s>  she could not but hear </s>
<s>  she could not avoid answering

till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of
forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence </s>
<s>  it must be
all conjecture </s>
<s> 

conjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one
conjectures wrong </s>
<s>  i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this
rivet quite firm </s>
<s>  what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard
at work if one talks at all </s>
<s> your real workmen i suppose hold their
tongues </s>
<s>  but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordmiss
fairfax said something about conjecturing </s>
<s>  there it is done </s>
<s>  i have the
pleasure madam to <abvr> bates of restoring your spectacles healed
for the present </s>
<s> 

he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter </s>
<s>  to escape a
little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss
fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more </s>
<s> 

if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we
danced last night </s>
<s> let me live them over again </s>
<s>  you did not enjoy them
as i did </s>
<s>  you appeared tired the whole time </s>
<s>  i believe you were glad we
danced no longer </s>
<s>  but i would have given worldsall the worlds one ever
has to givefor another halfhour </s>
<s> 

she played </s>
<s> 

what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one
happy </s>
<s> if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth </s>
<s> 

she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something
else </s>
<s>  he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning
to emma said

here is something quite new to me </s>
<s>  do you know it </s>
<s> cramer </s>
<s> and here
are a new set of irish melodies </s>
<s>  that from such a quarter one might
expect </s>
<s>  this was all sent with the instrument </s>
<s>  very thoughtful of
colonel campbell was not it </s>
<s> he knew miss fairfax could have no music
here </s>
<s>  i honour that part of the attention particularly </s>
<s>  it shews it to
have been so thoroughly from the heart </s>
<s>  nothing hastily done </s>
<s>  nothing
incomplete </s>
<s>  true affection only could have prompted it </s>
<s> 

emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused </s>
<s> 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains
of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness
there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the
amusement and much less compunction with respect to her </s>
<s> this
amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very
reprehensible feelings </s>
<s> 

he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together </s>
<s> emma
took the opportunity of whispering

you speak too plain </s>
<s>  she must understand you </s>
<s> 

i hope she does </s>
<s>  i would have her understand me </s>
<s>  i am not in the least
ashamed of my meaning </s>
<s> 

but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea </s>
<s> 

i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me </s>
<s>  i have now
a key to all her odd looks and ways </s>
<s>  leave shame to her </s>
<s>  if she does
wrong she ought to feel it </s>
<s> 

she is not entirely without it i think </s>
<s> 

i do not see much sign of it </s>
<s>  she is playing robin adair at this
momenthis favourite </s>
<s> 

shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried <abvr>
knightley on horseback not far off </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley i declare </s>
<s> i must speak to him if possible just to
thank him </s>
<s>  i will not open the window here </s>
<s>  it would give you all cold </s>
<s> 
but i can go into my mothers room you know </s>
<s>  i dare say he will come
in when he knows who is here </s>
<s>  quite delightful to have you all meet
so </s>
<s> our little room so honoured </s>
<s> 

she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the
casement there immediately called <abvr> knightleys attention and every
syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as
if it had passed within the same apartment </s>
<s> 

how d ye do </s>
<s> how dye do </s>
<s> very well i thank you </s>
<s>  so obliged to you
for the carriage last night </s>
<s>  we were just in time </s>
<s>  my mother just ready
for us </s>
<s>  pray come in </s>
<s>  do come in </s>
<s>  you will find some friends here </s>
<s> 

so began miss bates </s>
<s>  and <abvr> knightley seemed determined to be heard in
his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say

how is your niece miss bates </s>
<s> i want to inquire after you all but
particularly your niece </s>
<s>  how is miss fairfax </s>
<s> i hope she caught no cold
last night </s>
<s>  how is she today </s>
<s>  tell me how miss fairfax is </s>
<s> 

and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear
her in any thing else </s>
<s>  the listeners were amused </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston gave
emma a look of particular meaning </s>
<s>  but emma still shook her head in
steady scepticism </s>
<s> 

so obliged to you </s>
<s> so very much obliged to you for the carriage
 resumed miss bates </s>
<s> 

he cut her short with

i am going to kingston </s>
<s>  can i do any thing for you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dear kingstonare you </s>
<s> <abvr> cole was saying the other day she
wanted something from kingston </s>

<s> 

no i thank you </s>
<s>  but do come in </s>
<s>  who do you think is here </s>
<s> miss
woodhouse and miss smith </s>
<s>  so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte </s>
<s>

<s> 

well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps </s>
<s> 

and here is <abvr> weston and <abvr> frank churchill too </s>

so many friends </s>

well i am so sorry </s>

<s>  <abvr> knightley what a delightful party last

<s>  how extremely pleasant </s>
<s> did you ever see such dancing </s>
<s> was not
it delightful </s>
<s> miss woodhouse and <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  i never saw any
thing equal to it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  very delightful indeed </s>
<s>  i can say nothing less for i suppose miss
woodhouse and <abvr> frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes </s>
<s> 
and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should
not be mentioned too </s>
<s>  i think miss fairfax dances very well </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
weston is the very best countrydance player without exception
in england </s>
<s>  now if your friends have any gratitude they will say
something pretty loud about you and me in return </s>
<s>  but i cannot stay to
hear it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley one moment more </s>
<s>  something of consequenceso
shocked </s>
<s> jane and i are both so shocked about the apples </s>
<s> 

what is the matter now </s>
<s> 

to think of your sending us all your store apples </s>
<s>  you said you had
a great many and now you have not one left </s>
<s>  we really are so shocked </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  hodges may well be angry </s>
<s>  william larkins mentioned it here </s>
<s>  you
should not have done it indeed you should not </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  he is off </s>

can bear to be thanked </s>

would have been a pity not to have mentioned </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  well returning to the
room i have not been able to succeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley cannot stop </s>
<s>  he is
going to kingston </s>
<s>  he asked me if he could do any thing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was
open and the window was open and <abvr> knightley spoke loud </s>
<s>  you must
have heard every thing to be sure </s>
<s>  òcan i do any thing for you at
kingston </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  so i just mentioned </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse must you
be going </s>
<s> you seem but just comeso very obliging of you </s>
<s> 

emma found it really time to be at home </s>
<s>  the visit had already lasted
long </s>
<s>  and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived
to be gone that <abvr> weston and her companion taking leave also could
allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield
gates before they set off for randalls </s>
<s> 



chapter xi


it may be possible to do without dancing entirely </s>
<s>  instances have been
known of young people passing many many months successively without
being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue
either to body or mind </s>
<s> but when a beginning is madewhen the
felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly feltit
must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more </s>
<s> 

frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again </s>
<s> 
and the last halfhour of an evening which <abvr> woodhouse was persuaded
to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young
people in schemes on the subject </s>
<s>  franks was the first idea </s>
<s>  and his
the greatest zeal in pursuing it </s>
<s>  for the lady was the best judge of the
difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance </s>
<s> 
but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how
delightfully <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedfor
doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane
fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked
aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in
to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions
of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that
mr </s>
<s>  weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little
the largest </s>
<s> 

his first proposition and request that the dance begun at <abvr> coles
should be finished therethat the same party should be collected
and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and <abvr> weston
most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance </s>
<s> 
and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who
there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space
to every couple </s>
<s> 

you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss
coxes five had been repeated many times over </s>
<s>  and there will be the
two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure </s>
<s>  you and miss smith and
miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five </s>
<s>  and for five
couple there will be plenty of room </s>
<s> 

but soon it came to be on one side

but will there be good room for five couple </s>
<s> i really do not think
there will </s>
<s> 

on another

and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to
stand up </s>
<s>  five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it </s>
<s> 
it will not do to invite five couple </s>
<s>  it can be allowable only as the
thought of the moment </s>
<s> 

somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and
must be invited with the rest </s>
<s>  somebody else believed <abvr> gilbert
would have danced the other evening if she had been asked </s>
<s>  a word was
put in for a second young cox </s>
<s>  and at last <abvr> weston naming one family
of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance
who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple
would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what
possible manner they could be disposed of </s>
<s> 

the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other </s>
<s>  might not
they use both rooms and dance across the passage </s>
<s>  it seemed the
best scheme </s>
<s>  and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a
better </s>
<s>  emma said it would be awkward </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was in distress about
the supper </s>
<s>  and <abvr> woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of
health </s>
<s>  it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be
persevered in </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no said he </s>
<s>  it would be the extreme of imprudence </s>
<s>  i could not
bear it for emma </s>
<s> emma is not strong </s>
<s>  she would catch a dreadful cold </s>
<s> 
so would poor little harriet </s>
<s>  so you would all </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston you would
be quite laid up </s>
<s>  do not let them talk of such a wild thing </s>
<s>  pray do
not let them talk of it </s>
<s>  that young man speaking lower is very
thoughtless </s>
<s>  do not tell his father but that young man is not quite
the thing </s>
<s>  he has been opening the doors very often this evening
and keeping them open very inconsiderately </s>
<s>  he does not think of the
draught </s>
<s>  i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not
quite the thing </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was sorry for such a charge </s>
<s>  she knew the importance of
it and said every thing in her power to do it away </s>
<s>  every door was now
closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only
in the room they were in resorted to again </s>
<s>  and with such goodwill on
frank churchills part that the space which a quarter of an hour before
had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured
to be made out quite enough for ten </s>
<s> 

we were too magnificent said he </s>
<s>  we allowed unnecessary room </s>
<s>  ten
couple may stand here very well </s>
<s> 

emma demurred </s>
<s>  it would be a crowda sad crowd </s>
<s>  and what could be
worse than dancing without space to turn in </s>
<s> 

very true he gravely replied </s>
<s>  it was very bad </s>
<s>  but still he went on
measuring and still he ended with

i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple </s>
<s> 

no no said she you are quite unreasonable </s>
<s>  it would be dreadful
to be standing so close </s>
<s>  nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be
dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room </s>
<s> 

there is no denying it he replied </s>
<s>  i agree with you exactly </s>
<s>  a crowd
in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures
in a few words </s>
<s>  exquisite quite exquisite </s>
<s> still however having
proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up </s>
<s>  it would be
a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am
rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well </s>
<s> 

emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little
selfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of
dancing with her </s>
<s>  but she took the compliment and forgave the rest </s>
<s> 
had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to
pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference
and the character of his temper </s>
<s>  but for all the purposes of their
acquaintance he was quite amiable enough </s>
<s> 

before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield </s>
<s>  and he entered
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of
the scheme </s>
<s>  it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination
for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors
of my fathers little rooms </s>
<s>  i bring a new proposal on the subject </s>
<s> a
thought of my fathers which waits only your approbation to be acted
upon </s>
<s>  may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances
of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the
crown inn </s>
<s> 

the crown </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  if you and <abvr> woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there </s>
<s> 
better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful
welcome than at randalls </s>
<s>  it is his own idea </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston sees no
objection to it provided you are satisfied </s>
<s>  this is what we all feel </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s>  you were perfectly right </s>
<s>  ten couple in either of the randalls
rooms would have been insufferable </s>
<s> dreadful </s>
<s> i felt how right you
were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing
to like to yield </s>
<s>  is not it a good exchange </s>
<s> you consenti hope you
consent </s>
<s> 

it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if <abvr> and <abvr>
weston do not </s>
<s>  i think it admirable </s>
<s>  and as far as i can answer for
myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement that could
be </s>
<s>  papa do you not think it an excellent improvement </s>
<s> 

she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully
comprehended </s>
<s>  and then being quite new farther representations were
necessary to make it acceptable </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad planmuch
worse than the other </s>
<s>  a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous </s>
<s> 
never properly aired or fit to be inhabited </s>
<s>  if they must dance they
had better dance at randalls </s>
<s>  he had never been in the room at the crown
in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sight </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noa
very bad plan </s>
<s>  they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere </s>
<s> 

i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the
great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger
of any bodys catching coldso much less danger at the crown than at
randalls </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry might have reason to regret the alteration but
nobody else could </s>
<s> 

sir said <abvr> woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken
if you suppose <abvr> perry to be that sort of character </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry is
extremely concerned when any of us are ill </s>
<s>  but i do not understand how
the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fathers house </s>
<s> 

from the very circumstance of its being larger sir </s>
<s>  we shall have no
occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening </s>
<s>  and it
is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon
heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief </s>
<s> 

open the windows </s>
<s> but surely <abvr> churchill nobody would think of
opening the windows at randalls </s>
<s>  nobody could be so imprudent </s>
<s>  i never
heard of such a thing </s>
<s>  dancing with open windows </s>
<s> i am sure neither
your father nor <abvr> weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer
it </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a
windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected </s>
<s>  i have
often known it done myself </s>
<s> 

have you indeed sir </s>
<s> bless me </s>
<s>  i never could have supposed it </s>
<s>  but i
live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear </s>
<s>  however
this does make a difference </s>
<s>  and perhaps when we come to talk it
overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration </s>
<s>  one
cannot resolve upon them in a hurry </s>
<s>  if <abvr> and <abvr> weston will be so
obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what
can be done </s>
<s> 

but unfortunately sir my time is so limited

oh </s>
<s>  interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every
thing over </s>
<s>  there is no hurry at all </s>
<s>  if it can be contrived to be at
the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses </s>
<s>  they will be
so near their own stable </s>
<s> 

so they will my dear </s>
<s>  that is a great thing </s>
<s>  not that james ever
complains </s>
<s>  but it is right to spare our horses when we can </s>
<s>  if i could
be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is <abvr> stokes to be
trusted </s>
<s>  i doubt it </s>
<s>  i do not know her even by sight </s>
<s> 

i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be
under <abvr> westons care </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston undertakes to direct the whole </s>
<s> 

there papa </s>
<s> now you must be satisfiedour own dear <abvr> weston who
is carefulness itself </s>
<s>  do not you remember what <abvr> perry said so many
years ago when i had the measles </s>
<s>  òif miss taylor undertakes to
wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir </s>
<s>  how often have i
heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her </s>
<s> 

aye very true </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry did say so </s>
<s>  i shall never forget it </s>
<s>  poor
little emma </s>
<s>  you were very bad with the measles </s>
<s>  that is you would have
been very bad but for perrys great attention </s>
<s>  he came four times a day
for a week </s>
<s>  he said from the first it was a very good sortwhich
was our great comfort </s>
<s>  but the measles are a dreadful complaint </s>
<s>  i hope
whenever poor isabellas little ones have the measles she will send for
perry </s>
<s> 

my father and <abvr> weston are at the crown at this moment said frank
churchill examining the capabilities of the house </s>
<s>  i left them there
and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you
might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot </s>
<s>  i was
desired to say so from both </s>
<s>  it would be the greatest pleasure to
them if you could allow me to attend you there </s>
<s>  they can do nothing
satisfactorily without you </s>
<s> 

emma was most happy to be called to such a council </s>
<s>  and her father
engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people
set off together without delay for the crown </s>
<s>  there were <abvr> and <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and
very happy in their different way </s>
<s>  she in some little distress </s>
<s>  and he
finding every thing perfect </s>
<s> 

emma said she this paper is worse than i expected </s>
<s>  look </s>
<s>  in places
you see it is dreadfully dirty </s>
<s>  and the wainscot is more yellow and
forlorn than any thing i could have imagined </s>
<s> 

my dear you are too particular said her husband </s>
<s>  what does all that
signify </s>
<s>  you will see nothing of it by candlelight </s>
<s>  it will be as
clean as randalls by candlelight </s>
<s>  we never see any thing of it on our
clubnights </s>
<s> 

the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know
when things are dirty or not </s>
<s>  and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to
himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares </s>
<s> 

one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain </s>
<s> 
it regarded a supperroom </s>
<s>  at the time of the ballrooms being built
suppers had not been in question </s>
<s>  and a small cardroom adjoining was
the only addition </s>
<s>  what was to be done </s>
<s>  this cardroom would be wanted
as a cardroom now </s>
<s>  or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary
by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable
supper </s>
<s>  another room of much better size might be secured for the
purpose </s>
<s>  but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward
passage must be gone through to get at it </s>
<s>  this made a difficulty </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage </s>
<s> 
and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being
miserably crowded at supper </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston proposed having no regular supper </s>
<s>  merely sandwiches
&c </s>
<s>  set out in the little room </s>
<s>  but that was scouted as a wretched
suggestion </s>
<s>  a private dance without sitting down to supper was
pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women </s>
<s>  and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston must not speak of it again </s>
<s>  she then took another line of
expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed

i do not think it is so very small </s>
<s>  we shall not be many you know </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through
the passage was calling out

you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear </s>
<s>  it is a
mere nothing after all </s>
<s>  and not the least draught from the stairs </s>
<s> 

i wish said <abvr> weston one could know which arrangement our guests
in general would like best </s>
<s>  to do what would be most generally pleasing
must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be </s>
<s> 

yes very true cried frank very true </s>
<s>  you want your neighbours
opinions </s>
<s>  i do not wonder at you </s>
<s>  if one could ascertain what the chief
of themthe coles for instance </s>
<s>  they are not far off </s>
<s>  shall i call
upon them </s>
<s>  or miss bates </s>
<s>  she is still nearer </s>
<s> and i do not know
whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of
the rest of the people as any body </s>
<s>  i think we do want a larger council </s>
<s> 
suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us </s>
<s> 

wellif you please said <abvr> weston rather hesitating if you think
she will be of any use </s>
<s> 

you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma </s>
<s>  she
will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing </s>
<s>  she
will not even listen to your questions </s>
<s>  i see no advantage in consulting
miss bates </s>
<s> 

but she is so amusing so extremely amusing </s>
<s>  i am very fond of hearing
miss bates talk </s>
<s>  and i need not bring the whole family you know </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it
his decided approbation </s>
<s> 

aye do frank </s>
<s> go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at
once </s>
<s>  she will enjoy the scheme i am sure </s>
<s>  and i do not know a properer
person for shewing us how to do away difficulties </s>
<s>  fetch miss bates </s>
<s> 
we are growing a little too nice </s>
<s>  she is a standing lesson of how to be
happy </s>
<s>  but fetch them both </s>
<s>  invite them both </s>
<s> 

both sir </s>
<s>  can the old lady </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

the old lady </s>
<s>  no the young lady to be sure </s>
<s>  i shall think you a great
blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i beg your pardon sir </s>
<s>  i did not immediately recollect </s>
<s> 
undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both </s>
<s>  and
away he ran </s>
<s> 

long before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt
and her elegant niecemrs </s>
<s>  weston like a sweettempered woman and
a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it
much less than she had supposed beforeindeed very trifling </s>
<s>  and here
ended the difficulties of decision </s>
<s>  all the rest in speculation at
least was perfectly smooth </s>
<s>  all the minor arrangements of table and
chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves </s>
<s>  or were left
as mere trifles to be settled at any time between <abvr> weston and <abvr>
stokes </s>
<s> every body invited was certainly to come </s>
<s>  frank had already
written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight
which could not possibly be refused </s>
<s>  and a delightful dance it was to
be </s>
<s> 

most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must </s>
<s> 
as a counsellor she was not wanted </s>
<s>  but as an approver a much safer
character she was truly welcome </s>
<s>  her approbation at once general
and minute warm and incessant could not but please </s>
<s>  and for another
halfhour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms
some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the
future </s>
<s>  the party did not break up without emmas being positively
secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without
her overhearing <abvr> weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my
dear </s>
<s>  thats right </s>
<s>  i knew he would </s>

chapter xii


one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely
satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within the granted
term of frank churchills stay in surry </s>
<s>  for in spite of <abvr> westons
confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the
churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his
fortnight </s>
<s>  but this was not judged feasible </s>
<s>  the preparations must take
their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were
entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and
hoping in uncertaintyat the riskin her opinion the great risk of
its being all in vain </s>
<s> 

enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word </s>
<s>  his
wish of staying longer evidently did not please </s>
<s>  but it was not opposed </s>
<s> 
all was safe and prosperous </s>
<s>  and as the removal of one solicitude
generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her
ball began to adopt as the next vexation <abvr> knightleys provoking
indifference about it </s>
<s>  either because he did not dance himself or
because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he
seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its
exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement </s>
<s> 
to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply
than

very well </s>
<s>  if the westons think it worth while to be at all this
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say
against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yes
i must be there </s>
<s>  i could not refuse </s>
<s>  and i will keep as much awake as
i can </s>
<s>  but i would rather be at home looking over william larkinss
weeks account </s>
<s>  much rather i confess </s>
<s> pleasure in seeing
dancing </s>
<s> not i indeedi never look at iti do not know who
does </s>
<s> fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward </s>
<s> 
those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very
different </s>
<s> 

this emma felt was aimed at her </s>
<s>  and it made her quite angry </s>
<s>  it was not
in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so
indignant </s>
<s>  he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball
for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree </s>
<s>  it made
her animatedopen heartedshe voluntarily said </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball </s>
<s> 
what a disappointment it would be </s>
<s>  i do look forward to it i own with
very great pleasure </s>
<s> 

it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred
the society of william larkins </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> she was more and more convinced
that <abvr> weston was quite mistaken in that surmise </s>
<s>  there was a great
deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his sidebut no
love </s>
<s> 

alas </s>
<s>  there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  two
days of joyful security were immediately followed by the overthrow of
every thing </s>
<s>  a letter arrived from <abvr> churchill to urge his nephews
instant return </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill was unwellfar too unwell to do without
him </s>
<s>  she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband
when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual
unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of
herself she had not mentioned it </s>
<s>  but now she was too ill to trifle
and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay </s>
<s> 

the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from <abvr>
weston instantly </s>
<s>  as to his going it was inevitable </s>
<s>  he must be gone
within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt
to lessen his repugnance </s>
<s>  he knew her illnesses </s>
<s>  they never occurred but
for her own convenience </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to
highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there
whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him </s>
<s>  and that he might be
expected at hartfield very soon </s>
<s> 

this wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast </s>
<s>  when once it had
been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim </s>
<s>  the
loss of the ballthe loss of the young manand all that the young man
might be feeling </s>
<s> it was too wretched </s>
<s> such a delightful evening as
it would have been </s>
<s> every body so happy </s>
<s>  and she and her partner the
happiest </s>
<s> i said it would be so was the only consolation </s>
<s> 

her fathers feelings were quite distinct </s>
<s>  he thought principally of
mrs </s>
<s>  churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated </s>
<s>  and as
for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed </s>
<s>  but they
would all be safer at home </s>
<s> 

emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared </s>
<s>  but if this
reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want
of spirits when he did come might redeem him </s>
<s>  he felt the going away
almost too much to speak of it </s>
<s>  his dejection was most evident </s>
<s>  he
sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes </s>
<s>  and when rousing
himself it was only to say

of all horrid things leavetaking is the worst </s>
<s> 

but you will come again said emma </s>
<s>  this will not be your only visit
to randalls </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> shaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able to
return </s>
<s> i shall try for it with a zeal </s>
<s> it will be the object of
all my thoughts and cares </s>
<s> and if my uncle and aunt go to town this
springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last springi am afraid it
is a custom gone for ever </s>
<s> 

our poor ball must be quite given up </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  that ball </s>
<s> why did we wait for any thing </s>
<s> why not seize the
pleasure at once </s>
<s> how often is happiness destroyed by preparation
foolish preparation </s>
<s> you told us it would be so </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse
why are you always so right </s>
<s> 

indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance </s>
<s>  i would much
rather have been merry than wise </s>
<s> 

if i can come again we are still to have our ball </s>
<s>  my father depends
on it </s>
<s>  do not forget your engagement </s>
<s> 

emma looked graciously </s>
<s> 

such a fortnight as it has been </s>
<s>  he continued </s>
<s>  every day more
precious and more delightful than the day before </s>
<s> every day making
me less fit to bear any other place </s>
<s>  happy those who can remain at
highbury </s>
<s> 

as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will
venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first </s>
<s> 
do not we rather surpass your expectations </s>
<s>  i am sure we do </s>
<s>  i am sure
you did not much expect to like us </s>
<s>  you would not have been so long in
coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury </s>
<s> 

he laughed rather consciously </s>
<s>  and though denying the sentiment emma
was convinced that it had been so </s>
<s> 

and you must be off this very morning </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  my father is to join me here </s>
<s>  we shall walk back together and i
must be off immediately </s>
<s>  i am almost afraid that every moment will bring
him </s>
<s> 

not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss
bates </s>
<s>  how unlucky </s>
<s>  miss batess powerful argumentative mind might have
strengthened yours </s>
<s> 

yesi have called there </s>
<s>  passing the door i thought it better </s>
<s>  it
was a right thing to do </s>
<s>  i went in for three minutes and was detained
by miss batess being absent </s>
<s>  she was out </s>
<s>  and i felt it impossible not
to wait till she came in </s>
<s>  she is a woman that one may that one must
laugh at </s>
<s>  but that one would not wish to slight </s>
<s>  it was better to pay my
visit then

he hesitated got up walked to a window </s>
<s> 

in short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can hardly be
quite without suspicion

he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts </s>
<s>  she hardly knew
what to say </s>
<s>  it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely
serious which she did not wish </s>
<s>  forcing herself to speak therefore in
the hope of putting it by she calmly said

you are quite in the right </s>
<s>  it was most natural to pay your visit
then

he was silent </s>
<s>  she believed he was looking at her </s>
<s>  probably reflecting
on what she had said and trying to understand the manner </s>
<s>  she heard
him sigh </s>
<s>  it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh </s>
<s> 
he could not believe her to be encouraging him </s>
<s>  a few awkward moments
passed and he sat down again </s>
<s>  and in a more determined manner said

it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to
hartfield </s>
<s>  my regard for hartfield is most warm

he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed </s>
<s> he was more
in love with her than emma had supposed </s>
<s>  and who can say how it might
have ended if his father had not made his appearance </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse
soon followed </s>
<s>  and the necessity of exertion made him composed </s>
<s> 

a very few minutes more however completed the present trial </s>
<s>  <abvr>
weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of
procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that
was doubtful said it was time to go </s>
<s>  and the young man though he
might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave </s>
<s> 

i shall hear about you all said he </s>
<s>  that is my chief consolation </s>
<s> 
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you </s>
<s>  i have engaged
mrs </s>
<s>  weston to correspond with me </s>
<s>  she has been so kind as to promise
it </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really
interested in the absent </s>
<s> she will tell me every thing </s>
<s>  in her letters
i shall be at dear highbury again </s>
<s> 

a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye closed the
speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill </s>
<s>  short had been
the noticeshort their meeting </s>
<s>  he was gone </s>
<s>  and emma felt so sorry
to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his
absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too
much </s>
<s> 

it was a sad change </s>
<s>  they had been meeting almost every day since his
arrival </s>
<s>  certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to
the last two weeksindescribable spirit </s>
<s>  the idea the expectation
of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his
attentions his liveliness his manners </s>
<s>  it had been a very happy
fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common
course of hartfield days </s>
<s>  to complete every other recommendation he had
almost told her that he loved her </s>
<s>  what strength or what constancy of
affection he might be subject to was another point </s>
<s>  but at present
she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious
preference of herself </s>
<s>  and this persuasion joined to all the rest
made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of
every previous determination against it </s>
<s> 

i certainly must said she </s>
<s>  this sensation of listlessness
weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself
this feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house </s>
<s> 
i must be in love </s>
<s>  i should be the oddest creature in the world if i
were notfor a few weeks at least </s>
<s>  well </s>

chapter xiii


emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love </s>
<s>  her ideas
only varied as to the how much </s>
<s>  at first she thought it was a good
deal </s>
<s>  and afterwards but little </s>
<s>  she had great pleasure in hearing
frank churchill talked of </s>
<s>  and for his sake greater pleasure than ever
in seeing <abvr> and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  she was very often thinking of him and
quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were
his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to
randalls again this spring </s>
<s>  but on the other hand she could not admit
herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed
for employment than usual </s>
<s>  she was still busy and cheerful </s>
<s>  and
pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults </s>
<s>  and
farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or
working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close
of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing
elegant letters </s>
<s>  the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his
side was that she refused him </s>
<s>  their affection was always to subside
into friendship </s>
<s>  every thing tender and charming was to mark their
parting </s>
<s>  but still they were to part </s>
<s>  when she became sensible of this
it struck her that she could not be very much in love </s>
<s>  for in spite of
her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never
to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle
than she could foresee in her own feelings </s>
<s> 

i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said
she </s>
<s> in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is
there any allusion to making a sacrifice </s>
<s>  i do suspect that he is not
really necessary to my happiness </s>
<s>  so much the better </s>
<s>  i certainly will
not persuade myself to feel more than i do </s>
<s>  i am quite enough in love </s>
<s>  i
should be sorry to be more </s>
<s> 

upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings </s>
<s> 

he is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery
much in love indeed </s>
<s> and when he comes again if his affection
continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it </s>
<s> it would be most
inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up </s>
<s>  not that i
imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto </s>
<s>  no if he
had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been
so wretched </s>
<s>  could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and
language at parting would have been different </s>
<s> still however i must
be on my guard </s>
<s>  this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing
what it now is </s>
<s>  but i do not know that i expect it will </s>
<s>  i do not look
upon him to be quite the sort of mani do not altogether build upon
his steadiness or constancy </s>
<s> his feelings are warm but i can imagine
them rather changeable </s>
<s> every consideration of the subject in short
makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved </s>
<s> i
shall do very well again after a little whileand then it will be a
good thing over </s>
<s>  for they say every body is in love once in their lives
and i shall have been let off easily </s>
<s> 

when his letter to <abvr> weston arrived emma had the perusal of it </s>
<s>  and
she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her
at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had
undervalued their strength </s>
<s>  it was a long wellwritten letter giving
the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the
affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable
and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed
attractive with spirit and precision </s>
<s>  no suspicious flourishes now of
apology or concern </s>
<s>  it was the language of real feeling towards <abvr>
weston </s>
<s>  and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast
between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was
just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more
might have been said but for the restraints of propriety </s>
<s> the charm
of her own name was not wanting </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse appeared more than
once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a
compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said </s>
<s>  and in
the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any
such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of
her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all
conveyed </s>
<s>  compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these
wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss
woodhouses beautiful little friend </s>
<s>  pray make my excuses and adieus
to her </s>
<s>  this emma could not doubt was all for herself </s>
<s>  harriet was
remembered only from being her friend </s>
<s>  his information and prospects
as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own
imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again </s>
<s> 

gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material
part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned
to <abvr> weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could
still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her </s>
<s> 
her intentions were unchanged </s>
<s>  her resolution of refusal only grew more
interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation
and happiness </s>
<s>  his recollection of harriet and the words which
clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the
idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections </s>
<s>  was it
impossible </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in
understanding </s>
<s>  but he had been very much struck with the loveliness
of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner </s>
<s>  and all the
probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour </s>
<s> for
harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed </s>
<s> 

i must not dwell upon it said she </s>
<s> i must not think of it </s>
<s>  i know
the danger of indulging such speculations </s>
<s>  but stranger things have
happened </s>
<s>  and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it
will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested
friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure </s>
<s> 

it was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf though it
might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom </s>
<s>  for evil in that quarter
was at hand </s>
<s>  as frank churchills arrival had succeeded <abvr> eltons
engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest
had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchills
disappearance <abvr> eltons concerns were assuming the most irresistible
form </s>
<s> his weddingday was named </s>
<s>  he would soon be among them again </s>
<s>  <abvr>
elton and his bride </s>
<s>  there was hardly time to talk over the first letter
from enscombe before <abvr> elton and his bride was in every bodys
mouth and frank churchill was forgotten </s>
<s>  emma grew sick at the sound </s>
<s> 
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  and harriets
mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength </s>
<s> 
with <abvr> westons ball in view at least there had been a great deal of
insensibility to other things </s>
<s>  but it was now too evident that she had
not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual
approachnew carriage bellringing and all </s>
<s> 

poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could
give </s>
<s>  emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had
a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience </s>
<s>  but it was heavy work
to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed
to without being able to make their opinions the same </s>
<s>  harriet listened
submissively and said it was very trueit was just as miss woodhouse
describedit was not worth while to think about themand she would not
think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and
the next halfhour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as
before </s>
<s>  at last emma attacked her on another ground </s>
<s> 

your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about <abvr>
eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me </s>
<s> 
you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into </s>
<s> 
it was all my doing i know </s>
<s>  i have not forgotten it i assure
you </s>
<s> deceived myself i did very miserably deceive youand it will
be a painful reflection to me for ever </s>
<s>  do not imagine me in danger of
forgetting it </s>
<s> 

harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager
exclamation </s>
<s>  emma continued

i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake </s>
<s>  think less talk
less of <abvr> elton for my sake </s>
<s>  because for your own sake rather i
would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my
comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration of what is your
duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of
others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity </s>
<s> 
these are the motives which i have been pressing on you </s>
<s>  they are very
importantand sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act
upon them </s>
<s>  my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration </s>
<s> 
i want you to save yourself from greater pain </s>
<s>  perhaps i may sometimes
have felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what
would be kind by me </s>
<s> 

this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest </s>
<s>  the idea of
wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really
loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence
of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to
what was right and support her in it very tolerably </s>
<s> 

you who have been the best friend i ever had in my lifewant
gratitude to you </s>
<s> nobody is equal to you </s>
<s> i care for nobody as i do
for you </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been </s>
<s> 

such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and
manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so
well nor valued her affection so highly before </s>
<s> 

there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to
herself </s>
<s>  there is nothing to be compared to it </s>
<s>  warmth and tenderness
of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the
clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will </s>
<s>  it
is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally
belovedwhich gives isabella all her popularity </s>
<s> i have it notbut
i know how to prize and respect it </s>
<s> harriet is my superior in all the
charm and all the felicity it gives </s>
<s>  dear harriet </s>

<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the coldness of a jane fairfax </s>
<s> harriet is worth a
hundred suchand for a wifea sensible mans wifeit is invaluable </s>

chapter xiv


mrs </s>
<s>  elton was first seen at church </s>
<s>  but though devotion might be
interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and
it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to
settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or
not pretty at all </s>
<s> 

emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make
her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects </s>
<s>  and she made a
point of harriets going with her that the worst of the business might
be gone through as soon as possible </s>
<s> 

she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to
which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to
lace up her boot without recollecting </s>
<s>  a thousand vexatious thoughts
would recur </s>
<s>  compliments charades and horrible blunders </s>
<s>  and it was
not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too </s>
<s>  but
she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent </s>
<s>  the visit
was of course short </s>
<s>  and there was so much embarrassment and occupation
of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to
form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the
nothingmeaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing </s>
<s> 

she did not really like her </s>
<s>  she would not be in a hurry to find fault
but she suspected that there was no elegance </s>
<s> ease but not elegance </s>
<s> 
she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there
was too much ease </s>
<s>  her person was rather good </s>
<s>  her face not unpretty </s>
<s> 
but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant </s>
<s>  emma
thought at least it would turn out so </s>
<s> 

as for <abvr> elton his manners did not appearbut no she would not
permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners </s>
<s>  it was an
awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man
had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it </s>
<s>  the woman
was better off </s>
<s>  she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the
privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to
depend on </s>
<s>  and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor <abvr>
elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just
married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had
been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as
little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as
could be </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the
house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin </s>
<s>  well miss
woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her </s>
<s> is not she
very charming </s>
<s> 

there was a little hesitation in emmas answer </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesverya very pleasing young woman </s>
<s> 

i think her beautiful quite beautiful </s>
<s> 

very nicely dressed indeed </s>
<s>  a remarkably elegant gown </s>
<s> 

i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nothere is nothing to surprize one at all </s>
<s> a pretty fortune </s>
<s>  and
she came in his way </s>
<s> 

i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very
much attached to him </s>
<s> 

perhaps she might </s>
<s>  but it is not every mans fate to marry the woman
who loves him best </s>
<s>  miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this
the best offer she was likely to have </s>
<s> 

yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever
have a better </s>
<s>  well i wish them happy with all my heart </s>
<s>  and now miss
woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again </s>
<s>  he is just as
superior as ever </s>
<s> but being married you know it is quite a different
thing </s>
<s>  no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid </s>
<s>  i can sit and
admire him now without any great misery </s>
<s>  to know that he has not thrown
himself away is such a comfort </s>
<s> she does seem a charming young woman
just what he deserves </s>
<s>  happy creature </s>
<s>  he called her òaugusta </s>
<s>  how
delightful </s>
<s> 

when the visit was returned emma made up her mind </s>
<s>  she could then see
more and judge better </s>
<s>  from harriets happening not to be at hartfield
and her fathers being present to engage <abvr> elton she had a quarter
of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself and could composedly
attend to her </s>
<s>  and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that
mrs </s>
<s>  elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and
thinking much of her own importance </s>
<s>  that she meant to shine and be very
superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert
and familiar </s>
<s>  that all her notions were drawn from one set of people
and one style of living </s>
<s>  that if not foolish she was ignorant and that
her society would certainly do <abvr> elton no good </s>
<s> 

harriet would have been a better match </s>
<s>  if not wise or refined herself
she would have connected him with those who were </s>
<s>  but miss hawkins it
might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of
her own set </s>
<s>  the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride of the
alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him </s>
<s> 

the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother
mr </s>
<s>  sucklings seat </s>
<s> a comparison of hartfield to maple grove </s>
<s>  the
grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty </s>
<s>  and the house was
modern and wellbuilt </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton seemed most favourably impressed
by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or
imagine </s>
<s>  very like maple grove indeed </s>
<s> she was quite struck by the
likeness </s>
<s> that room was the very shape and size of the morningroom
at maple grove </s>
<s>  her sisters favourite room </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton was appealed
to </s>
<s> was not it astonishingly like </s>
<s> she could really almost fancy
herself at maple grove </s>
<s> 

and the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like the
staircase was </s>
<s>  placed exactly in the same part of the house </s>
<s>  i really
could not help exclaiming </s>
<s>  i assure you miss woodhouse it is very
delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to
as maple grove </s>
<s>  i have spent so many happy months there </s>
<s>  with a little
sigh of sentiment </s>
<s>  a charming place undoubtedly </s>
<s>  every body who
sees it is struck by its beauty </s>
<s>  but to me it has been quite a home </s>
<s> 
whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will
understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like
what one has left behind </s>
<s>  i always say this is quite one of the evils of
matrimony </s>
<s> 

emma made as slight a reply as she could </s>
<s>  but it was fully sufficient
for <abvr> elton who only wanted to be talking herself </s>
<s> 

so extremely like maple grove </s>
<s>  and it is not merely the housethe
grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like </s>
<s> 
the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand
very much in the same wayjust across the lawn </s>
<s>  and i had a glimpse
of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in
mind </s>
<s>  my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place </s>
<s>  people
who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing
in the same style </s>
<s> 

emma doubted the truth of this sentiment </s>
<s>  she had a great idea that
people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the
extensive grounds of any body else </s>
<s>  but it was not worth while to attack
an error so doubledyed and therefore only said in reply

when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you
have overrated hartfield </s>
<s>  surry is full of beauties </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yes i am quite aware of that </s>
<s>  it is the garden of england you
know </s>
<s>  surry is the garden of england </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction </s>
<s>  many
counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as
surry </s>
<s> 

no i fancy not replied <abvr> elton with a most satisfied smile </s>
<s> 
i never heard any county but surry called so </s>
<s> 

emma was silenced </s>
<s> 

my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer
at farthest continued <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  and that will be our time for
exploring </s>
<s>  while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare
say </s>
<s>  they will have their barouchelandau of course which holds four
perfectly </s>
<s>  and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage
we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well </s>
<s>  they
would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the
year </s>
<s>  indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their
bringing the barouchelandau </s>
<s>  it will be so very much preferable </s>
<s> 
when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss
woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
suckling is extremely fond of exploring </s>
<s>  we explored to kingsweston
twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their
first having the barouchelandau </s>
<s>  you have many parties of that kind
here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  not immediately here </s>
<s>  we are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of </s>
<s>  and we
are a very quiet set of people i believe </s>
<s>  more disposed to stay at home
than engage in schemes of pleasure </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort </s>
<s>  nobody can
be more devoted to home than i am </s>
<s>  i was quite a proverb for it at maple
grove </s>
<s>  many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol
òi really cannot get this girl to move from the house </s>
<s>  i absolutely must
go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouchelandau
without a companion </s>
<s>  but augusta i believe with her own goodwill
would never stir beyond the park paling </s>
<s>  many a time has she said so </s>
<s> 
and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion </s>
<s>  i think on the contrary
when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very
bad thing </s>
<s>  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little </s>
<s>  i
perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouselooking
towards <abvr> woodhouse your fathers state of health must be a great
drawback </s>
<s>  why does not he try bath </s>
<s> indeed he should </s>
<s>  let me recommend
bath to you </s>
<s>  i assure you i have no doubt of its doing <abvr> woodhouse
good </s>
<s> 

my father tried it more than once formerly </s>
<s>  but without receiving any
benefit </s>
<s>  and <abvr> perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you
does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thats a great pity </s>
<s>  for i assure you miss woodhouse where the
waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give </s>
<s>  in my bath
life i have seen such instances of it </s>
<s>  and it is so cheerful a place
that it could not fail of being of use to <abvr> woodhouses spirits
which i understand are sometimes much depressed </s>
<s>  and as to its
recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell
on them </s>
<s>  the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally
understood </s>
<s>  it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived
so secluded a life </s>
<s>  and i could immediately secure you some of the best
society in the place </s>
<s>  a line from me would bring you a little host of
acquaintance </s>
<s>  and my particular friend <abvr> partridge the lady i have
always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any
attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public
with </s>
<s> 

it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite </s>
<s>  the idea
of her being indebted to <abvr> elton for what was called an
introductionof her going into public under the auspices of a friend
of <abvr> eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow who with the
help of a boarder just made a shift to live </s>
<s> the dignity of miss
woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed </s>
<s> 

she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have
given and only thanked <abvr> elton coolly </s>
<s>  but their going to bath was
quite out of the question </s>
<s>  and she was not perfectly convinced that
the place might suit her better than her father </s>
<s>  and then to prevent
farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly </s>
<s> 

i do not ask whether you are musical <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  upon these occasions
a ladys character generally precedes her </s>
<s>  and highbury has long known
that you are a superior performer </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s>  i must protest against any such idea </s>
<s>  a superior
performer </s>
<s> very far from it i assure you </s>
<s>  consider from how partial
a quarter your information came </s>
<s>  i am doatingly fond of
musicpassionately fond </s>
<s> and my friends say i am not entirely devoid
of taste </s>
<s>  but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is
mediocre to the last degree </s>
<s>  you miss woodhouse i well know play
delightfully </s>
<s>  i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction
comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got
into </s>
<s>  i absolutely cannot do without music </s>
<s>  it is a necessary of life to
me </s>
<s>  and having always been used to a very musical society both at
maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice </s>
<s>  i
honestly said as much to <abvr> e </s>
<s>  when he was speaking of my future
home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be
disagreeable </s>
<s>  and the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had
been accustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension </s>
<s> 
when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the
world i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear of
retirement </s>
<s>  blessed with so many resources within myself the world was
not necessary to me </s>
<s>  i could do very well without it </s>
<s>  to those who had
no resources it was a different thing </s>
<s>  but my resources made me quite
independent </s>
<s>  and as to smallersized rooms than i had been used to i
really could not give it a thought </s>
<s>  i hoped i was perfectly equal to any
sacrifice of that description </s>
<s>  certainly i had been accustomed to every
luxury at maple grove </s>
<s>  but i did assure him that two carriages were not
necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments </s>
<s>  òbut said i
òto be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a
musical society </s>
<s>  i condition for nothing else </s>
<s>  but without music life
would be a blank to me </s>
<s> 

we cannot suppose said emma smiling that <abvr> elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury </s>
<s>  and
i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be
pardoned in consideration of the motive </s>
<s> 

no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head </s>
<s>  i am delighted to
find myself in such a circle </s>
<s>  i hope we shall have many sweet little
concerts together </s>
<s>  i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a
musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours </s>
<s> 
will not it be a good plan </s>
<s>  if we exert ourselves i think we shall
not be long in want of allies </s>
<s>  something of that nature would be
particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in
practice </s>
<s>  for married women you knowthere is a sad story against
them in general </s>
<s>  they are but too apt to give up music </s>
<s> 

but you who are so extremely fond of itthere can be no danger
surely </s>
<s> 

i should hope not </s>
<s>  but really when i look around among my acquaintance
i tremble </s>
<s>  selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the

but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a
train

well said <abvr> elton laughing we shall see </s>
<s> 

emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing
more to say </s>

subject </s>
<s> 

we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at
home </s>
<s>  and very pleasant people they seem to be </s>
<s>  i like them extremely </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  weston seems an excellent creaturequite a firstrate favourite
with me already i assure you </s>

something so motherly and kindhearted about her that it wins upon one
directly </s>
<s>  she was your governess i think </s>
<s> 

emma was almost too much astonished to answer </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton hardly
waited for the affirmative before she went on </s>
<s> 

having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very
ladylike </s>
<s>  but she is really quite the gentlewoman </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  westons manners said emma were always particularly good </s>
<s> 
their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest
model for any young woman </s>
<s> 

and who do you think came in while we were there </s>
<s> 

emma was quite at a loss </s>
<s>  the tone implied some old acquaintanceand
how could she possibly guess </s>
<s> 

knightley </s>
<s>  continued <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  knightley himself </s>
<s> was not it
lucky </s>
<s> for not being within when he called the other day i had never
seen him before </s>
<s>  and of course as so particular a friend of <abvr> e </s>

caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend </s>

knightley is quite the gentleman </s>

<s>  decidedly i
think a very gentlemanlike man </s>
<s> 

happily it was now time to be gone </s>

breathe </s>
<s> 

insufferable woman </s>
<s>  was her immediate exclamation </s>

supposed </s>
<s>  absolutely insufferable </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> i could not have
believed it </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> never seen him in her life before and call
him knightley </s>
<s> and discover that he is a gentleman </s>
<s>  a little upstart
vulgar being with her <abvr> e </s>
<s>  and her caro sposo and her
resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery </s>
<s> 
actually to discover that <abvr> knightley is a gentleman </s>
<s>  i doubt whether
he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady </s>
<s>  i could
not have believed it </s>
<s>  and to propose that she and i should unite to
form a musical club </s>
<s>  one would fancy we were bosom friends </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
weston </s>
<s> astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a
gentlewoman </s>
<s>  worse and worse </s>
<s>  i never met with her equal </s>
<s>  much beyond
my hopes </s>
<s>  harriet is disgraced by any comparison </s>

would be </s>

<s>  always the first
person to be thought of </s>
<s>  how i catch myself out </s>
<s>  frank churchill comes
as regularly into my mind </s>
<s> 

all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father
had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was
ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending </s>
<s> 

well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her
before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady </s>
<s>  and i dare say she
was very much pleased with you </s>
<s>  she speaks a little too quick </s>
<s>  a little
quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear </s>
<s>  but i believe
i am nice </s>
<s>  i do not like strange voices </s>
<s>  and nobody speaks like you and
poor miss taylor </s>
<s>  however she seems a very obliging prettybehaved
young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife </s>
<s>  though i think
he had better not have married </s>
<s>  i made the best excuses i could for not
having been able to wait on him and <abvr> elton on this happy occasion </s>
<s>  i
said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer </s>
<s>  but i ought to
have gone before </s>
<s>  not to wait upon a bride is very remiss </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  it shews
what a sad invalid i am </s>
<s>  but i do not like the corner into vicarage
lane </s>
<s> 

i dare say your apologies were accepted sir </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton knows you </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects to her
if possible </s>
<s>  it was being very deficient </s>
<s> 

but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony </s>
<s>  and therefore why
should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride </s>
<s>  it ought to
be no recommendation to you </s>
<s>  it is encouraging people to marry if you
make so much of them </s>
<s> 

no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always
wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride especially
is never to be neglected </s>
<s>  more is avowedly due to her </s>
<s>  a bride you
know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who
they may </s>
<s> 

well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what
is </s>
<s>  and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to
such vanitybaits for poor young ladies </s>
<s> 

my dear you do not understand me </s>
<s>  this is a matter of mere
common politeness and goodbreeding and has nothing to do with any
encouragement to people to marry </s>

emma had done </s>

her </s>

chapter xv


emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill
opinion of <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  her observation had been pretty correct </s>
<s>  such as
mrs </s>
<s>  elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared
whenever they met againselfimportant presuming familiar ignorant
and illbred </s>
<s>  she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment
but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior
knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood </s>
<s> 
and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as <abvr>
eltons consequence only could surpass </s>
<s> 

there was no reason to suppose <abvr> elton thought at all differently from
his wife </s>
<s>  he seemed not merely happy with her but proud </s>
<s>  he had the air
of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury
as not even miss woodhouse could equal </s>
<s>  and the greater part of her
new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging
following the lead of miss batess goodwill or taking it for granted
that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed
herself were very well satisfied </s>
<s>  so that <abvr> eltons praise
passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss
woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with
a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed </s>
<s> 

in one respect <abvr> elton grew even worse than she had appeared at
first </s>
<s>  her feelings altered towards emma </s>
<s> offended probably by the
little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew
back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant </s>
<s>  and
though the effect was agreeable the illwill which produced it was
necessarily increasing emmas dislike </s>
<s>  her manners tooand <abvr>
eltons were unpleasant towards harriet </s>
<s>  they were sneering and
negligent </s>
<s>  emma hoped it must rapidly work harriets cure </s>
<s>  but the
sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very
much </s>
<s> it was not to be doubted that poor harriets attachment had been
an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under
a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him
had in all likelihood been given also </s>
<s>  she was of course the object
of their joint dislike </s>
<s> when they had nothing else to say it must be
always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  and the enmity which
they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in
contemptuous treatment of harriet </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax </s>
<s>  and from the first </s>
<s>  not
merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to
recommend the other but from the very first </s>
<s>  and she was not satisfied
with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationbut without
solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and
befriend her </s>
<s> before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the
third time of their meeting she heard all <abvr> eltons knighterrantry
on the subject </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse </s>
<s> i quite rave
about jane fairfax </s>
<s> a sweet interesting creature </s>
<s>  so mild and
ladylikeand with such talents </s>
<s> i assure you i think she has very
extraordinary talents </s>
<s>  i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely
well </s>
<s>  i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she
is absolutely charming </s>
<s>  you will laugh at my warmthbut upon my word
i talk of nothing but jane fairfax </s>
<s> and her situation is so calculated
to affect one </s>
<s> miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour
to do something for her </s>
<s>  we must bring her forward </s>
<s>  such talent as hers
must not be suffered to remain unknown </s>
<s> i dare say you have heard those
charming lines of the poet

        òfull many a flower is born to blush unseen
          òand waste its fragrance on the desert air </s>
<s> 

we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

i cannot think there is any danger of it was emmas calm answerand
when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation and
understand what her home has been with colonel and <abvr> campbell i
have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such
obscurity so thrown away </s>
<s> whatever advantages she may have enjoyed
with the campbells are so palpably at an end </s>
<s>  and i think she feels it </s>
<s> 
i am sure she does </s>
<s>  she is very timid and silent </s>
<s>  one can see that she
feels the want of encouragement </s>
<s>  i like her the better for it </s>
<s>  i
must confess it is a recommendation to me </s>
<s>  i am a great advocate for
timidityand i am sure one does not often meet with it </s>
<s> but in those
who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  i assure
you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more
than i can express </s>
<s> 

you appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any of
miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer
than yourself can shew her any other attention than

my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to
act </s>
<s>  you and i need not be afraid </s>
<s>  if we set the example many will
follow it as far as they can </s>
<s>  though all have not our situations </s>
<s>  we
have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style
which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the
least inconvenient </s>
<s> i should be extremely displeased if wright were to
send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more
than jane fairfax to partake of it </s>
<s>  i have no idea of that sort of
thing </s>
<s>  it is not likely that i should considering what i have been
used to </s>
<s>  my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the
other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense </s>
<s>  maple
grove will probably be my model more than it ought to befor we do not
at all affect to equal my brother <abvr> suckling in income </s>
<s> however my
resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax </s>
<s> i shall certainly have
her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall
have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly
on the watch for an eligible situation </s>
<s>  my acquaintance is so very
extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit
her shortly </s>
<s> i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my
brother and sister when they come to us </s>
<s>  i am sure they will like her
extremely </s>
<s>  and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears
will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners
of either but what is highly conciliating </s>
<s> i shall have her very often
indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a
seat for her in the barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties </s>
<s> 

poor jane fairfax </s>
<s> thought emma </s>
<s> you have not deserved this </s>
<s>  you
may have done wrong with regard to <abvr> dixon but this is a punishment
beyond what you can have merited </s>
<s> the kindness and protection of <abvr>
elton </s>
<s> òjane fairfax and jane fairfax </s>
<s>  heavens </s>
<s>  let me not suppose
that she dares go about emma woodhouseing me </s>
<s> but upon my honour
there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that womans tongue </s>
<s> 

emma had not to listen to such paradings againto any so exclusively
addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear miss
woodhouse </s>
<s>  the change on <abvr> eltons side soon afterwards appeared
and she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular
friend of <abvr> elton nor under <abvr> eltons guidance the very active
patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general
way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done </s>
<s> 

she looked on with some amusement </s>
<s> miss batess gratitude for
mrs </s>
<s>  eltons attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless
simplicity and warmth </s>
<s>  she was quite one of her worthiesthe
most amiable affable delightful womanjust as accomplished and
condescending as <abvr> elton meant to be considered </s>
<s>  emmas only surprize
was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate <abvr>
elton as she seemed to do </s>
<s>  she heard of her walking with the eltons
sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons </s>
<s>  this was
astonishing </s>
<s> she could not have believed it possible that the taste or
the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as
the vicarage had to offer </s>
<s> 

she is a riddle quite a riddle </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> to chuse to remain here
month after month under privations of every sort </s>
<s>  and now to chuse the
mortification of <abvr> eltons notice and the penury of her conversation
rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her
with such real generous affection </s>
<s> 

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months </s>
<s>  the campbells
were gone to ireland for three months </s>
<s>  but now the campbells had
promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh
invitations had arrived for her to join them there </s>
<s>  according to miss
batesit all came from hermrs </s>
<s>  dixon had written most pressingly </s>
<s> 
would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends
contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist </s>
<s>  but still she had
declined it </s>
<s> 

she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing
this invitation was emmas conclusion </s>
<s>  she must be under some sort
of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself </s>
<s>  there is great
fear great caution great resolution somewhere </s>
<s> she is not to be
with the dixons </s>
<s>  the decree is issued by somebody </s>
<s>  but why must she
consent to be with the eltons </s>
<s> here is quite a separate puzzle </s>
<s> 

upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before
the few who knew her opinion of <abvr> elton <abvr> weston ventured this
apology for jane </s>
<s> 

we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage
my dear emmabut it is better than being always at home </s>
<s>  her aunt is a
good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome </s>
<s>  we
must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for
what she goes to </s>
<s> 

you are right <abvr> weston said <abvr> knightley warmly miss fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 
could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen
her </s>
<s>  but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from
mrs </s>
<s>  elton which nobody else pays her </s>
<s> 

emma felt that <abvr> weston was giving her a momentary glance </s>
<s>  and she
was herself struck by his warmth </s>
<s>  with a faint blush she presently
replied

such attentions as <abvr> eltons i should have imagined would rather
disgust than gratify miss fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons invitations i should
have imagined any thing but inviting </s>
<s> 

i should not wonder said <abvr> weston if miss fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness in
accepting <abvr> eltons civilities for her </s>
<s>  poor miss bates may
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in
spite of the very natural wish of a little change </s>
<s> 

both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again </s>
<s>  and after a few
minutes silence he said

another thing must be taken into consideration toomrs </s>
<s>  elton does
not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her </s>
<s>  we all know the
difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken
amongst us </s>
<s>  we all feel the influence of a something beyond common
civility in our personal intercourse with each othera something more
early implanted </s>
<s>  we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we
may have been very full of the hour before </s>
<s>  we feel things differently </s>
<s> 
and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be
sure that miss fairfax awes <abvr> elton by her superiority both of mind
and manner </s>
<s>  and that face to face <abvr> elton treats her with all the
respect which she has a claim to </s>
<s>  such a woman as jane fairfax probably
never fell in <abvr> eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can
prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if
not in consciousness </s>
<s> 

i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma </s>
<s>  little henry
was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her
irresolute what else to say </s>
<s> 

yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her </s>
<s> 

and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon
stoppingit was better however to know the worst at onceshe hurried
onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it
is </s>
<s>  the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or
other </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick
leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or
some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered

oh </s>
<s>  are you there </s>
<s> but you are miserably behindhand </s>
<s>  <abvr> cole gave me
a hint of it six weeks ago </s>
<s> 

he stopped </s>
<s> emma felt her foot pressed by <abvr> weston and did not
herself know what to think </s>
<s>  in a moment he went on

that will never be however i can assure you </s>
<s>  miss fairfax i dare
say would not have me if i were to ask herand i am very sure i shall
never ask her </s>
<s> 

emma returned her friends pressure with interest </s>
<s>  and was pleased
enough to exclaim

you are not vain <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i will say that for you </s>
<s> 

he seemed hardly to hear her </s>
<s>  he was thoughtfuland in a manner which
shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said

so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

no indeed i have not </s>
<s>  you have scolded me too much for matchmaking
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you </s>
<s>  what i said just now
meant nothing </s>
<s>  one says those sort of things of course without any
idea of a serious meaning </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  no upon my word i have not the smallest
wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body </s>
<s>  you would not come
in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was thoughtful again </s>
<s>  the result of his reverie was no
emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take
me by surprize </s>
<s> i never had a thought of her in that way i assure
you </s>
<s>  and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young
womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect </s>
<s>  she has a fault </s>
<s>  she has
not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife </s>
<s> 

emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault </s>
<s>  well said
she and you soon silenced <abvr> cole i suppose </s>
<s> 

yes very soon </s>
<s>  he gave me a quiet hint </s>
<s>  i told him he was mistaken </s>
<s> 
he asked my pardon and said no more </s>
<s>  cole does not want to be wiser or
wittier than his neighbours </s>
<s> 

in that respect how unlike dear <abvr> elton who wants to be wiser and
wittier than all the world </s>
<s>  i wonder how she speaks of the coleswhat
she calls them </s>
<s>  how can she find any appellation for them deep enough
in familiar vulgarity </s>
<s>  she calls you knightleywhat can she do for
mr </s>
<s>  cole </s>
<s>  and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts
her civilities and consents to be with her </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston your argument
weighs most with me </s>
<s>  i can much more readily enter into the temptation
of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of
miss fairfaxs mind over <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  i have no faith in <abvr> eltons
acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed </s>
<s>  or in her
being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding </s>
<s> 
i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor
with praise encouragement and offers of service </s>
<s>  that she will not be
continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her
a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring
parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax has feeling said <abvr> knightleyi do not accuse her
of want of feeling </s>
<s>  her sensibilities i suspect are strongand her
temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience selfcontrol </s>
<s> 
but it wants openness </s>
<s>  she is reserved more reserved i think than
she used to beand i love an open temper </s>
<s>  notill cole alluded to my
supposed attachment it had never entered my head </s>
<s>  i saw jane fairfax
and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no
thought beyond </s>
<s> 

well <abvr> weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do
you say now to <abvr> knightleys marrying jane fairfax </s>
<s> 

why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the
idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it
were to end in his being so at last </s>
<s>  do not beat me </s>

chapter xvi


every body in and about highbury who had ever visited <abvr> elton was
disposed to pay him attention on his marriage </s>
<s>  dinnerparties and
eveningparties were made for him and his lady </s>
<s>  and invitations flowed
in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were
never to have a disengaged day </s>
<s> 

i see how it is said she </s>
<s>  i see what a life i am to lead among you </s>
<s> 
upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated </s>
<s>  we really seem quite
the fashion </s>
<s>  if this is living in the country it is nothing very
formidable </s>
<s>  from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a
disengaged day </s>
<s> a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have
been at a loss </s>
<s> 

no invitation came amiss to her </s>
<s>  her bath habits made eveningparties
perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for
dinners </s>
<s>  she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at
the poor attempt at routcakes and there being no ice in the highbury
cardparties </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates <abvr> perry <abvr> goddard and others were a
good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew
them how every thing ought to be arranged </s>
<s>  in the course of the spring
she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which
her cardtables should be set out with their separate candles and
unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the
evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the
refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order </s>
<s> 

emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at
hartfield for the eltons </s>
<s>  they must not do less than others or she
should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful
resentment </s>
<s>  a dinner there must be </s>
<s>  after emma had talked about it for
ten minutes <abvr> woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the
usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself
with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him </s>
<s> 

the persons to be invited required little thought </s>
<s>  besides the
eltons it must be the westons and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  so far it was all of
courseand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must
be asked to make the eighth </s>
<s> but this invitation was not given with
equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased
by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it </s>
<s>  she would rather not
be in his company more than she could help </s>
<s>  she was not yet quite
able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling

<s>  she was delighted with the
fortitude of her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to
give up being in company and stay at home </s>
<s>  and she could now invite the
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax </s>
<s> 
since her last conversation with <abvr> weston and <abvr> knightley she
was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had often
been </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightleys words dwelt with her </s>
<s>  he had said that jane
fairfax received attentions from <abvr> elton which nobody else paid her </s>
<s> 

this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which
was all that was meantand it is very shameful </s>
<s> of the same ageand
always knowing heri ought to have been more her friend </s>
<s> she will
never like me now </s>
<s>  i have neglected her too long </s>
<s>  but i will shew her
greater attention than i have done </s>
<s> 

every invitation was successful </s>
<s>  they were all disengaged and all
happy </s>
<s> the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet
over </s>
<s>  a circumstance rather unlucky occurred </s>
<s>  the two eldest little
knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some
weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and
staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be the very day
of this party </s>

put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening
so </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the

apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not
being able to come even to hartfield for fortyeight hours without
falling in with a dinnerparty </s>
<s> 

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by
representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet
he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very
immaterial </s>
<s>  she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to
have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her
instead of his brother </s>
<s> 

the event was more favourable to <abvr> woodhouse than to emma </s>
<s>  john
knightley came </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and
must be absent on the very day </s>
<s>  he might be able to join them in the
evening but certainly not to dinner </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse was quite at ease </s>
<s> 
and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the
philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the
chief of even emmas vexation </s>
<s> 

the day came the party were punctually assembled and <abvr> john
knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being
agreeable </s>
<s>  instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they
waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton
as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in
silencewanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut
miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk
to her </s>
<s>  he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk
with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain </s>
<s>  it was
natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said

i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am
sure you must have been wet </s>
<s> we scarcely got home in time </s>
<s>  i hope you
turned directly </s>
<s> 

i went only to the postoffice said she and reached home before the
rain was much </s>
<s>  it is my daily errand </s>
<s>  i always fetch the letters when
i am here </s>
<s>  it saves trouble and is a something to get me out </s>
<s>  a walk
before breakfast does me good </s>
<s> 

not a walk in the rain i should imagine </s>
<s> 

no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley smiled and replied

that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards
from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you </s>
<s>  and henry
and john had seen more drops than they could count long before </s>
<s>  the
postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives </s>
<s>  when you have
lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going
through the rain for </s>
<s> 

there was a little blush and then this answer

i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every
dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing
older should make me indifferent about letters </s>
<s> 

indifferent </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  noi never conceived you could become indifferent </s>
<s> 
letters are no matter of indifference </s>
<s>  they are generally a very
positive curse </s>
<s> 

you are speaking of letters of business </s>
<s>  mine are letters of
friendship </s>
<s> 

i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly </s>
<s> 
business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you are not serious now </s>
<s>  i know <abvr> john knightley too welli am
very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body </s>
<s>  i
can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than
to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which
makes the difference it is not age but situation </s>
<s>  you have every
body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again </s>
<s> 
and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a postoffice
i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than
today </s>
<s> 

when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years
 said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which
time usually brings </s>
<s>  i consider one as including the other </s>
<s>  time will
generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily
circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you </s>
<s>  as an old
friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence
you may have as many concentrated objects as i have </s>
<s> 

it was kindly said and very far from giving offence </s>
<s>  a pleasant thank
you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear
in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh </s>
<s>  her attention was
now claimed by <abvr> woodhouse who being according to his custom on such
occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular
compliments to the ladies was ending with herand with all his mildest
urbanity said

i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning
in the rain </s>
<s>  young ladies should take care of themselves </s>
<s> young ladies
are delicate plants </s>
<s>  they should take care of their health and their
complexion </s>
<s>  my dear did you change your stockings </s>
<s> 

yes sir i did indeed </s>
<s>  and i am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me </s>
<s> 

my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for </s>
<s> i
hope your good grandmama and aunt are well </s>
<s>  they are some of my very
old friends </s>
<s>  i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour </s>
<s>  you
do us a great deal of honour today i am sure </s>
<s>  my daughter and i
are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest
satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield </s>
<s> 

the kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he
had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy </s>
<s> 

by this time the walk in the rain had reached <abvr> elton and her
remonstrances now opened upon jane </s>
<s> 

my dear jane what is this i hear </s>
<s> going to the postoffice in the
rain </s>
<s> this must not be i assure you </s>
<s> you sad girl how could you do
such a thing </s>
<s> it is a sign i was not there to take care of you </s>
<s> 

jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  do not tell me </s>
<s>  you really are a very sad girl and do not know
how to take care of yourself </s>
<s> to the postoffice indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
did you ever hear the like </s>
<s>  you and i must positively exert our
authority </s>
<s> 

my advice said <abvr> weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do
feel tempted to give </s>
<s>  miss fairfax you must not run such risks </s>
<s> liable
as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly
careful especially at this time of year </s>
<s>  the spring i always think
requires more than common care </s>
<s>  better wait an hour or two or even
half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough
again </s>
<s>  now do not you feel that you had </s>
<s>  yes i am sure you are much too
reasonable </s>
<s>  you look as if you would not do such a thing again </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined <abvr>
elton </s>
<s>  we will not allow her to do such a thing again </s>
<s> and nodding
significantlythere must be some arrangement made there must indeed </s>
<s> 
i shall speak to <abvr> e </s>
<s>  the man who fetches our letters every morning
one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and
bring them to you </s>
<s>  that will obviate all difficulties you know </s>
<s>  and from
us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept
such an accommodation </s>
<s> 

you are extremely kind said jane </s>
<s>  but i cannot give up my early
walk </s>
<s>  i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk
somewhere and the postoffice is an object </s>
<s>  and upon my word i have
scarcely ever had a bad morning before </s>
<s> 

my dear jane say no more about it </s>
<s>  the thing is determined that is
laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing
without the concurrence of my lord and master </s>
<s>  you know <abvr> weston
you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves </s>
<s>  but i do flatter
myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out </s>
<s>  if i
meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as
settled </s>
<s> 

excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such
an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant </s>
<s>  if the errand
were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am
not here by my grandmamas </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear </s>
<s>  but so much as patty has to do </s>
<s> and it is a kindness to
employ our men </s>
<s> 

jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered </s>
<s>  but instead of
answering she began speaking again to <abvr> john knightley </s>
<s> 

the postoffice is a wonderful establishment </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> the
regularity and despatch of it </s>
<s>  if one thinks of all that it has to do
and all that it does so well it is really astonishing </s>
<s> 

it is certainly very well regulated </s>
<s> 

so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears </s>
<s>  so seldom that
a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the
kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million i suppose
actually lost </s>
<s>  and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad
hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder </s>
<s> 

the clerks grow expert from habit </s>
<s> they must begin with some quickness
of sight and hand and exercise improves them </s>
<s>  if you want any farther
explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it </s>
<s>  that is
the key to a great deal of capacity </s>
<s>  the public pays and must be served
well </s>
<s> 

the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual
observations made </s>
<s> 

i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort
of handwriting often prevails in a family </s>
<s>  and where the same master
teaches it is natural enough </s>
<s>  but for that reason i should imagine
the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very
little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can
get </s>
<s>  isabella and emma i think do write very much alike </s>
<s>  i have not
always known their writing apart </s>
<s> 

yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness </s>
<s>  i know what
you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest </s>
<s> 

isabella and emma both write beautifully said <abvr> woodhouse </s>
<s>  and
always did </s>
<s>  and so does poor <abvr> westonwith half a sigh and half a
smile at her </s>
<s> 

i never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also at
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  but stopped on perceiving that <abvr> weston was attending
to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect now how am
i going to introduce him </s>
<s> am i unequal to speaking his name at once
before all these people </s>
<s>  is it necessary for me to use any roundabout
phrase </s>
<s> your yorkshire friendyour correspondent in yorkshire </s>
<s> that
would be the way i suppose if i were very bad </s>
<s> no i can pronounce
his name without the smallest distress </s>
<s>  i certainly get better and
better </s>
<s> now for it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was disengaged and emma began againmr </s>
<s>  frank churchill
writes one of the best gentlemans hands i ever saw </s>
<s> 

i do not admire it said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  it is too smallwants
strength </s>
<s>  it is like a womans writing </s>
<s> 

this was not submitted to by either lady </s>
<s>  they vindicated him against
the base aspersion </s>
<s>  no it by no means wanted strengthit was not a
large hand but very clear and certainly strong </s>
<s>  had not <abvr> weston any
letter about her to produce </s>
<s>  no she had heard from him very lately
but having answered the letter had put it away </s>
<s> 

if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk i
am sure i could produce a specimen </s>
<s>  i have a note of his </s>
<s> do not you
remember <abvr> weston employing him to write for you one day </s>
<s> 

he chose to say he was employed

well well i have that note </s>
<s>  and can shew it after dinner to convince
mr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  when a gallant young man like <abvr> frank churchill said <abvr>
knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of
course put forth his best </s>
<s> 

dinner was on table </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  elton before she could be spoken to was
ready </s>
<s>  and before <abvr> woodhouse had reached her with his request to be
allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying

must i go first </s>
<s>  i really am ashamed of always leading the way </s>
<s> 

janes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma </s>
<s> 
she had heard and seen it all </s>
<s>  and felt some curiosity to know whether
the wet walk of this morning had produced any </s>
<s>  she suspected that it
had </s>
<s>  that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full
expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been
in vain </s>
<s>  she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usuala
glow both of complexion and spirits </s>
<s> 

she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the
expense of the irish mails </s>
<s> it was at her tongues endbut she
abstained </s>
<s>  she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt
jane fairfaxs feelings </s>
<s>  and they followed the other ladies out of the
room arm in arm with an appearance of goodwill highly becoming to the
beauty and grace of each </s>

chapter xvii


when the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found it
hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties </s>
<s> with so
much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did <abvr> elton engross
jane fairfax and slight herself </s>
<s>  she and <abvr> weston were obliged to
be almost always either talking together or silent together </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton
left them no choice </s>
<s>  if jane repressed her for a little time she
soon began again </s>
<s>  and though much that passed between them was in a
halfwhisper especially on <abvr> eltons side there was no avoiding
a knowledge of their principal subjects </s>
<s>  the postofficecatching
coldfetching lettersand friendship were long under discussion </s>
<s> 
and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant
to janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to
suit her and professions of <abvr> eltons meditated activity </s>
<s> 

here is april come </s>
<s>  said she i get quite anxious about you </s>
<s>  june
will soon be here </s>
<s> 

but i have never fixed on june or any other monthmerely looked
forward to the summer in general </s>
<s> 

but have you really heard of nothing </s>
<s> 

i have not even made any inquiry </s>
<s>  i do not wish to make any yet </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear we cannot begin too early </s>
<s>  you are not aware of the
difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing </s>
<s> 

i not aware </s>
<s>  said jane shaking her head </s>
<s>  dear <abvr> elton who can
have thought of it as i have done </s>
<s> 

but you have not seen so much of the world as i have </s>
<s>  you do not know
how many candidates there always are for the first situations </s>
<s>  i saw
a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove </s>
<s>  a cousin of
mr </s>
<s>  suckling <abvr> bragge had such an infinity of applications </s>
<s>  every
body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle </s>
<s> 
waxcandles in the schoolroom </s>
<s>  you may imagine how desirable </s>
<s>  of all
houses in the kingdom <abvr> bragges is the one i would most wish to see
you in </s>
<s> 

colonel and <abvr> campbell are to be in town again by midsummer
 said jane </s>
<s>  i must spend some time with them </s>
<s>  i am sure they will want
it </s>
<s> afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself </s>
<s>  but i would
not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present </s>
<s> 

trouble </s>
<s>  aye i know your scruples </s>
<s>  you are afraid of giving me
trouble </s>
<s>  but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be
more interested about you than i am </s>
<s>  i shall write to <abvr> partridge in
a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the lookout
for any thing eligible </s>
<s> 

thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to
her </s>
<s>  till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body
trouble </s>
<s> 

but my dear child the time is drawing near </s>
<s>  here is april and june
or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before
us </s>
<s>  your inexperience really amuses me </s>
<s>  a situation such as you deserve
and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence
is not obtained at a moments notice </s>
<s>  indeed indeed we must begin
inquiring directly </s>
<s> 

excuse me maam but this is by no means my intention </s>
<s>  i make no
inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends </s>
<s>  when
i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being
long unemployed </s>
<s>  there are places in town offices where inquiry
would soon produce somethingoffices for the salenot quite of human
fleshbut of human intellect </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  my dear human flesh </s>
<s>  you quite shock me </s>
<s>  if you mean a fling at
the slavetrade i assure you <abvr> suckling was always rather a friend to
the abolition </s>
<s> 

i did not mean i was not thinking of the slavetrade replied jane </s>
<s> 
governesstrade i assure you was all that i had in view </s>
<s>  widely
different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on </s>
<s>  but as to
the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies </s>
<s>  but
i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by
applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with
something that would do </s>
<s> 

something that would do </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  aye that may suit
your humble ideas of yourself </s>
<s> i know what a modest creature you are </s>
<s> 
but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any
thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family
not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of
life </s>
<s> 

you are very obliging </s>
<s>  but as to all that i am very indifferent </s>
<s> 
it would be no object to me to be with the rich </s>
<s>  my mortifications i
think would only be the greater </s>
<s>  i should suffer more from comparison </s>
<s> 
a gentlemans family is all that i should condition for </s>
<s> 

i know you i know you </s>
<s>  you would take up with any thing </s>
<s>  but i shall
be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite
on my side </s>
<s>  with your superior talents you have a right to move in the
first circle </s>
<s>  your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name
your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family
as much as you chose </s>
<s> that isi do not knowif you knew the harp you
might do all that i am very sure </s>
<s>  but you sing as well as play </s>
<s> yes i
really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what
you chose </s>
<s> and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and
comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest </s>
<s> 

you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such
a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal </s>
<s> 
however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted
at present for me </s>
<s>  i am exceedingly obliged to you <abvr> elton i am
obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing
nothing to be done till the summer </s>
<s>  for two or three months longer i
shall remain where i am and as i am </s>
<s> 

and i am quite serious too i assure you replied <abvr> elton gaily
in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to
watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us </s>
<s> 

in this style she ran on </s>
<s>  never thoroughly stopped by any thing till <abvr>
woodhouse came into the room </s>
<s>  her vanity had then a change of object
and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane

here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest </s>
<s> only think of his
gallantry in coming away before the other men </s>
<s> what a dear creature
he is </s>
<s> i assure you i like him excessively </s>
<s>  i admire all that quaint
oldfashioned politeness </s>
<s>  it is much more to my taste than modern ease </s>
<s> 
modern ease often disgusts me </s>
<s>  but this good old <abvr> woodhouse i wish
you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  i assure you i
began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous </s>
<s>  i fancy i
am rather a favourite </s>
<s>  he took notice of my gown </s>
<s>  how do you like
it </s>
<s> selinas choicehandsome i think but i do not know whether it
is not overtrimmed </s>
<s>  i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being
overtrimmedquite a horror of finery </s>
<s>  i must put on a few ornaments
now because it is expected of me </s>
<s>  a bride you know must appear like
a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity </s>
<s>  a simple style
of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery </s>
<s>  but i am quite in the
minority i believe </s>
<s>  few people seem to value simplicity of dressshow
and finery are every thing </s>
<s>  i have some notion of putting such a
trimming as this to my white and silver poplin </s>
<s>  do you think it will
look well </s>
<s> 

the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom when <abvr>
weston made his appearance among them </s>
<s>  he had returned to a late dinner
and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over </s>
<s>  he had been too much
expected by the best judges for surprizebut there was great joy </s>
<s>  <abvr>
woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry
to see him before </s>
<s>  john knightley only was in mute astonishment </s>
<s> that
a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day
of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile
to another mans house for the sake of being in mixed company till
bedtime of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise
of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply </s>
<s>  a man who had been
in motion since eight oclock in the morning and might now have been
still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had
been in more than one crowd and might have been alone </s>
<s> such a man to
quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the
evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world </s>
<s> could
he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there
would have been a motive </s>
<s>  but his coming would probably prolong rather
than break up the party </s>
<s>  john knightley looked at him with amazement
then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it
even of him </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was
exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being
principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was
making himself agreeable among the rest </s>
<s>  and having satisfied the
inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all
her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread
abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family
communication which though principally addressed to <abvr> weston he
had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in
the room </s>
<s>  he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself </s>
<s>  he
had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it </s>
<s> 

read it read it said he it will give you pleasure </s>
<s>  only a few
lineswill not take you long </s>
<s>  read it to emma </s>
<s> 

the two ladies looked over it together </s>
<s>  and he sat smiling and talking
to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to
every body </s>
<s> 

well he is coming you see </s>
<s>  good news i think </s>
<s>  well what do you say
to it </s>
<s> i always told you he would be here again soon did not i </s>
<s> anne
my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me </s>
<s> in

<s>  for she is as
impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done </s>
<s>  most
likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday </s>
<s>  as to her illness all
nothing of course </s>
<s>  but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us
again so near as town </s>
<s>  they will stay a good while when they do come

<s> 
well pretty good news is not it </s>

<s>  has emma read
it all </s>
<s>  put it up put it up </s>
<s>  we will have a good talk about it some
other time but it will not do now </s>
<s>  i shall only just mention the
circumstance to the others in a common way </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion </s>
<s>  her looks
and words had nothing to restrain them </s>
<s>  she was happy she knew she was
happy and knew she ought to be happy </s>
<s>  her congratulations were warm and
open </s>
<s>  but emma could not speak so fluently </s>

in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her
agitation which she rather thought was considerable </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative
to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already </s>

it was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he might
not have thought either <abvr> woodhouse or <abvr> knightley particularly
delighted </s>

be made happy </s>
<s> from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but
she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have
been too positive an interruption </s>

with her </s>

<s> this letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry
merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to
town directly on <abvr> churchills accountshe has not been well the
whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for herso they are all to
move southward without loss of time </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> from yorkshire i think </s>
<s>  enscombe is in yorkshire </s>
<s> 

yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a
considerable journey </s>
<s> 

yes upon my word very considerable </s>
<s>  sixtyfive miles farther than
from maple grove to london </s>
<s>  but what is distance <abvr> weston to people
of large fortune </s>
<s> you would be amazed to hear how my brother <abvr>
suckling sometimes flies about </s>
<s>  you will hardly believe mebut twice
in one week he and <abvr> bragge went to london and back again with four
horses </s>
<s> 

the evil of the distance from enscombe said <abvr> weston is that
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together </s>
<s>  in franks last letter she complained he
said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
both his arm and his uncles </s>
<s>  this you know speaks a great degree of
weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to
sleep only two nights on the road </s>
<s> so frank writes word </s>
<s>  certainly
delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  you
must grant me that </s>
<s> 

no indeed i shall grant you nothing </s>
<s>  i always take the part of my
own sex </s>
<s>  i do indeed </s>
<s>  i give you noticeyou will find me a formidable
antagonist on that point </s>
<s>  i always stand up for womenand i assure you
if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you
would not wonder at <abvr> churchills making incredible exertions to
avoid it </s>
<s>  selina says it is quite horror to herand i believe i have
caught a little of her nicety </s>
<s>  she always travels with her own sheets </s>
<s> 
an excellent precaution </s>
<s>  does <abvr> churchill do the same </s>
<s> 

depend upon it <abvr> churchill does every thing that any other fine
lady ever did </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill will not be second to any lady in the land
for

mrs </s>
<s>  elton eagerly interposed with

oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston do not mistake me </s>
<s>  selina is no fine lady i assure
you </s>
<s>  do not run away with such an idea </s>
<s> 

is not she </s>
<s>  then she is no rule for <abvr> churchill who is as thorough
a fine lady as any body ever beheld </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly </s>
<s> 
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was
not a fine lady </s>
<s>  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of
it </s>
<s> and she was considering in what way she had best retract when <abvr>
weston went on </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspectbut
this is quite between ourselves </s>
<s>  she is very fond of frank and
therefore i would not speak ill of her </s>
<s>  besides she is out of health
now </s>
<s>  but that indeed by her own account she has always been </s>
<s>  i would
not say so to every body <abvr> elton but i have not much faith in <abvr>
churchills illness </s>
<s> 

if she is really ill why not go to bath <abvr> weston </s>
<s> to bath or to
clifton </s>
<s>  she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for
her </s>
<s>  the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe </s>
<s>  she has now
been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she
begins to want change </s>
<s>  it is a retired place </s>
<s>  a fine place but very
retired </s>
<s> 

ayelike maple grove i dare say </s>
<s>  nothing can stand more retired from
the road than maple grove </s>
<s>  such an immense plantation all round it </s>
<s>  you
seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement </s>
<s> and
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy
that sort of seclusion </s>
<s>  or perhaps she may not have resources enough in
herself to be qualified for a country life </s>
<s>  i always say a woman cannot
have too many resourcesand i feel very thankful that i have so many
myself as to be quite independent of society </s>
<s> 

frank was here in february for a fortnight </s>
<s> 

so i remember to have heard </s>
<s>  he will find an addition to the society
of highbury when he comes again </s>
<s>  that is if i may presume to call
myself an addition </s>
<s>  but perhaps he may never have heard of there being
such a creature in the world </s>
<s> 

this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and <abvr>
weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed

my dear madam </s>
<s>  nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible </s>
<s> 
not heard of you </s>
<s> i believe <abvr> westons letters lately have been full
of very little else than <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

he had done his duty and could return to his son </s>
<s> 

when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we
might see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome </s>
<s>  it has
been completely unexpected </s>
<s>  that is i always had a strong persuasion
he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn
upbut nobody believed me </s>
<s>  he and <abvr> weston were both dreadfully
desponding </s>
<s>  òhow could he contrive to come </s>
<s>  and how could it be supposed
that his uncle and aunt would spare him again </s>
<s>  and so forthi always
felt that something would happen in our favour </s>
<s>  and so it has you see </s>
<s> 
i have observed <abvr> elton in the course of my life that if things
are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next </s>
<s> 

very true <abvr> weston perfectly true </s>
<s>  it is just what i used to say to
a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because
things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity
which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that
he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymens saffron robe
would be put on for us </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  the pains i have been at to dispel those
gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views </s>
<s>  the carriagewe had
disappointments about the carriage </s>
<s> one morning i remember he came to
me quite in despair </s>
<s> 

she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and <abvr> weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on </s>
<s> 

you were mentioning may </s>
<s>  may is the very month which <abvr> churchill
is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than
enscombein short to spend in london </s>
<s>  so that we have the agreeable
prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole springprecisely the
season of the year which one should have chosen for it </s>
<s>  days almost at
the longest </s>
<s>  weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and
never too hot for exercise </s>
<s>  when he was here before we made the best
of it </s>
<s>  but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather </s>
<s> 
there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we
intended </s>
<s>  now will be the time </s>
<s>  this will be complete enjoyment </s>
<s>  and i
do not know <abvr> elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the
sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in today or
tomorrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than
having him actually in the house </s>
<s>  i think it is so </s>
<s>  i think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight </s>
<s>  i hope you will be
pleased with my son </s>
<s>  but you must not expect a prodigy </s>
<s>  he is generally
thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy </s>
<s>  <abvr> westons
partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most
gratifying to me </s>
<s>  she thinks nobody equal to him </s>
<s> 

and i assure you <abvr> weston i have very little doubt that my opinion
will be decidedly in his favour </s>
<s>  i have heard so much in praise of <abvr>
frank churchill </s>
<s> at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one
of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly
guided by others </s>
<s>  i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall
judge of him </s>
<s> i am no flatterer </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston was musing </s>
<s> 

i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor <abvr>
churchill </s>
<s>  if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice </s>
<s>  but
there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to
speak of her with the forbearance i could wish </s>
<s>  you cannot be ignorant
mrs </s>
<s>  elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have
met with </s>
<s>  and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid
to her </s>
<s>  she was the instigator </s>
<s>  franks mother would never have been
slighted as she was but for her </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill has pride </s>
<s>  but his pride
is nothing to his wifes </s>
<s>  his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort
of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless
and tiresome </s>
<s>  but her pride is arrogance and insolence </s>
<s>  and what
inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood </s>
<s> 
she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman </s>
<s> 
but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld
them all in high and mighty claims </s>
<s>  but in herself i assure you she is
an upstart </s>
<s> 

only think </s>
<s>  well that must be infinitely provoking </s>
<s>  i have quite
a horror of upstarts </s>
<s>  maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to
people of that sort </s>
<s>  for there is a family in that neighbourhood who
are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give
themselves </s>
<s>  your description of <abvr> churchill made me think of them
directly </s>
<s>  people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and
encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs
and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families </s>
<s> 
a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west
hall </s>
<s>  and how they got their fortune nobody knows </s>
<s>  they came from
birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
one has not great hopes from birmingham </s>
<s>  i always say there is something
direful in the sound </s>
<s>  but nothing more is positively known of the
tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected </s>
<s>  and
yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to
my brother <abvr> suckling who happens to be one of their nearest
neighbours </s>
<s>  it is infinitely too bad </s>
<s>  <abvr> suckling who has been eleven
years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before himi
believe at leasti am almost sure that old <abvr> suckling had completed
the purchase before his death </s>
<s> 

they were interrupted </s>
<s>  tea was carrying round and <abvr> weston having
said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away </s>
<s> 

after tea <abvr> and <abvr> weston and <abvr> elton sat down with <abvr>
woodhouse to cards </s>
<s>  the remaining five were left to their own powers
and emma doubted their getting on very well </s>
<s>  for <abvr> knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was wanting notice which
nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits
which would have made her prefer being silent </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  john knightley proved more talkative than his brother </s>
<s>  he was to
leave them early the next day </s>
<s>  and he soon began with

well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the
boys </s>
<s>  but you have your sisters letter and every thing is down at full
length there we may be sure </s>
<s>  my charge would be much more concise than
hers and probably not much in the same spirit </s>
<s>  all that i have to
recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic
them </s>
<s> 

i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all
in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella </s>
<s>  and
happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic </s>
<s> 

and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again </s>
<s> 

that is very likely </s>
<s>  you think so do not you </s>
<s> 

i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your fatheror even
may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to
increase as much as they have done lately </s>
<s> 

increase </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>  you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made a
great difference in your way of life </s>
<s> 

difference </s>
<s>  no indeed i am not </s>
<s> 

there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than
you used to be </s>
<s>  witness this very time </s>
<s>  here am i come down for only
one day and you are engaged with a dinnerparty </s>
<s> when did it happen
before or any thing like it </s>
<s>  your neighbourhood is increasing and you
mix more with it </s>
<s>  a little while ago every letter to isabella brought
an account of fresh gaieties </s>
<s>  dinners at <abvr> coles or balls at the
crown </s>
<s>  the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your
goingson is very great </s>
<s> 

yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all </s>
<s> 

very welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less
influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that
henry and john may be sometimes in the way </s>
<s>  and if they are i only beg
you to send them home </s>
<s> 

no cried <abvr> knightley that need not be the consequence </s>
<s>  let them
be sent to donwell </s>
<s>  i shall certainly be at leisure </s>
<s> 

upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me </s>
<s>  i should like to know how
many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of
the party </s>
<s>  and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to
attend to the little boys </s>

they been </s>

hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i
cannot imagine </s>
<s>  and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt
emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better
with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she
is absent oneand who when he is at home is either reading to himself
or settling his accounts </s>

mr </s>

volume iii



chapter i


a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill </s>
<s>  she
was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all
apprehensive or embarrassed </s>
<s>  it was for him </s>
<s>  her own attachment had
really subsided into a mere nothing </s>
<s>  it was not worth thinking of </s>
<s> but
if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the
two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had
taken away it would be very distressing </s>
<s>  if a separation of two
months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before
her </s>
<s> caution for him and for herself would be necessary </s>
<s>  she did
not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be
incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his </s>
<s> 

she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration </s>
<s> 
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present
acquaintance </s>
<s>  and yet she could not help rather anticipating something
decisive </s>
<s>  she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a
crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil
state </s>
<s> 

it was not very long though rather longer than <abvr> weston had foreseen
before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills
feelings </s>
<s>  the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been
imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards </s>
<s>  he rode down
for a couple of hours </s>
<s>  he could not yet do more </s>
<s>  but as he came from
randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick
observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she
must act </s>
<s>  they met with the utmost friendliness </s>
<s>  there could be no doubt
of his great pleasure in seeing her </s>
<s>  but she had an almost instant doubt
of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness
in the same degree </s>
<s>  she watched him well </s>
<s>  it was a clear thing he was
less in love than he had been </s>
<s>  absence with the conviction probably
of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable
effect </s>
<s> 

he was in high spirits </s>
<s>  as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed
delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories </s>
<s>  and he
was not without agitation </s>
<s>  it was not in his calmness that she read
his comparative difference </s>
<s>  he was not calm </s>
<s>  his spirits were evidently
fluttered </s>
<s>  there was restlessness about him </s>
<s>  lively as he was it seemed
a liveliness that did not satisfy himself </s>
<s>  but what decided her belief
on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying
away to make other calls in highbury </s>
<s>  he had seen a group of old
acquaintance in the street as he passedhe had not stopped he would
not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would
be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer
at hartfield he must hurry off </s>
<s>  she had no doubt as to his being less
in lovebut neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed
like a perfect cure </s>
<s>  and she was rather inclined to think it implied a
dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting
himself with her long </s>
<s> 

this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days </s>
<s> 
he was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented </s>
<s>  his
aunt could not bear to have him leave her </s>
<s>  such was his own account at
randalls </s>
<s>  if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was
to be inferred that <abvr> churchills removal to london had been of no
service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder </s>
<s>  that she was
really ill was very certain </s>
<s>  he had declared himself convinced of it at
randalls </s>
<s>  though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked
back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a
year ago </s>
<s>  he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care
and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many
years of existence before her </s>
<s>  but he could not be prevailed on by all
his fathers doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary
or that she was as strong as ever </s>
<s> 

it soon appeared that london was not the place for her </s>
<s>  she could
not endure its noise </s>
<s>  her nerves were under continual irritation and
suffering </s>
<s>  and by the ten days end her nephews letter to randalls
communicated a change of plan </s>
<s>  they were going to remove immediately to
richmond </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of
an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place </s>
<s>  a
readyfurnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit
expected from the change </s>
<s> 

emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months
before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friendsfor the
house was taken for may and june </s>
<s>  she was told that now he wrote with
the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he
could even wish </s>
<s> 

emma saw how <abvr> weston understood these joyous prospects </s>
<s>  he was
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered </s>
<s>  she
hoped it was not so </s>
<s>  two months must bring it to the proof </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  westons own happiness was indisputable </s>
<s>  he was quite delighted </s>
<s> 
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for </s>
<s>  now it would be
really having frank in their neighbourhood </s>
<s>  what were nine miles to
a young man </s>
<s> an hours ride </s>
<s>  he would be always coming over </s>
<s>  the
difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make
the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never </s>
<s>  sixteen
milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen to manchesterstreetwas
a serious obstacle </s>
<s>  were he ever able to get away the day would be
spent in coming and returning </s>
<s>  there was no comfort in having him in
london </s>
<s>  he might as well be at enscombe </s>
<s>  but richmond was the very
distance for easy intercourse </s>
<s>  better than nearer </s>
<s> 

one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this
removalthe ball at the crown </s>
<s>  it had not been forgotten before
but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day </s>
<s>  now
however it was absolutely to be </s>
<s>  every preparation was resumed and
very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from
frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and
that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour hours at
any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  westons ball was to be a real thing </s>
<s>  a very few tomorrows stood
between the young people of highbury and happiness </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse was resigned </s>
<s>  the time of year lightened the evil to him </s>
<s> 
may was better for every thing than february </s>
<s>  <abvr> bates was engaged to
spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely
hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any
thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone </s>
<s> 



chapter ii


no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball </s>
<s>  the day approached
the day arrived </s>
<s>  and after a morning of some anxious watching frank
churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before
dinner and every thing was safe </s>
<s> 

no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma </s>
<s>  the room
at the crown was to witness it </s>
<s> but it would be better than a
common meeting in a crowd </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had been so very earnest in his
entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves
for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of
the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him
and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young mans company </s>
<s> 
she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the
randalls party just sufficiently before them </s>
<s> 

frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch </s>
<s>  and though he did not
say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening </s>
<s> 
they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should
be </s>
<s>  and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another
carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great
surprize </s>
<s>  so unreasonably early </s>
<s>  she was going to exclaim </s>
<s>  but she
presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming
like herself by particular desire to help <abvr> westons judgment </s>
<s>  and
they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins
who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing
earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company
might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory
inspection </s>
<s> 

emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which <abvr> weston
depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man
who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first
distinction in the scale of vanity </s>
<s>  she liked his open manners but
a little less of openheartedness would have made him a higher
character </s>
<s> general benevolence but not general friendship made a
man what he ought to be </s>
<s> she could fancy such a man </s>
<s>  the whole party
walked about and looked and praised again </s>
<s>  and then having nothing
else to do formed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe
in their various modes till other subjects were started that though
may a fire in the evening was still very pleasant </s>
<s> 

emma found that it was not <abvr> westons fault that the number of privy
councillors was not yet larger </s>
<s>  they had stopped at <abvr> batess door
to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be
brought by the eltons </s>
<s> 

frank was standing by her but not steadily </s>
<s>  there was a restlessness
which shewed a mind not at ease </s>
<s>  he was looking about he was going to
the door he was watching for the sound of other carriagesimpatient
to begin or afraid of being always near her </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton was spoken of </s>
<s>  i think she must be here soon said he </s>
<s>  i
have a great curiosity to see <abvr> elton i have heard so much of her </s>
<s> 
it cannot be long i think before she comes </s>
<s> 

a carriage was heard </s>
<s>  he was on the move immediately </s>
<s>  but coming back
said

i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her </s>
<s>  i have never seen
either <abvr> or <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  i have no business to put myself forward </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton appeared </s>
<s>  and all the smiles and the proprieties
passed </s>
<s> 

but miss bates and miss fairfax </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston looking about </s>
<s>  we
thought you were to bring them </s>
<s> 

the mistake had been slight </s>
<s>  the carriage was sent for them now </s>
<s>  emma
longed to know what franks first opinion of <abvr> elton might be </s>
<s>  how
he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of
graciousness </s>
<s>  he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion
by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed </s>
<s> 

in a few minutes the carriage returned </s>
<s> somebody talked of rain </s>
<s> i
will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father </s>
<s> 
miss bates must not be forgotten </s>
<s>  and away he went </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was
following </s>
<s>  but <abvr> elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion
of his son </s>
<s>  and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself
though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing </s>
<s> 

a very fine young man indeed <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  you know i candidly told you
i should form my own opinion </s>
<s>  and i am happy to say that i am extremely
pleased with him </s>
<s> you may believe me </s>
<s>  i never compliment </s>
<s>  i think him
a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and
approveso truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism </s>
<s> 
you must know i have a vast dislike to puppiesquite a horror of them </s>
<s> 
they were never tolerated at maple grove </s>
<s>  neither <abvr> suckling nor
me had ever any patience with them </s>
<s>  and we used sometimes to say very
cutting things </s>
<s>  selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them
much better </s>
<s> 

while she talked of his son <abvr> westons attention was chained </s>
<s>  but
when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies
just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton turned to <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i have no doubt of its being our
carriage with miss bates and jane </s>
<s>  our coachman and horses are so
extremely expeditious </s>

miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into
the room </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton seemed to think it as much her duty as <abvr>
westons to receive them </s>
<s>  her gestures and movements might be understood
by any one who looked on like emma </s>
<s>  but her words every bodys words
were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in
talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her
being admitted into the circle at the fire </s>

frank churchill returned to his station by emma </s>
<s>  and as soon as miss
bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse
of <abvr> elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind
her </s>
<s> he was thoughtful </s>
<s>  whether he were overhearing too she could not
determine </s>
<s>  after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look
compliments very quietly and properly taken <abvr> elton was evidently
wanting to be complimented herselfand it was how do you like
my gown </s>
<s> how do you like my trimming </s>
<s> how has wright done my
hair </s>
<s> with many other relative questions all answered with patient
politeness </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton then said nobody can think less of dress in
general than i dobut upon such an occasion as this when every bodys
eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westonswho i have
no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish
to be inferior to others </s>
<s>  and i see very few pearls in the room except
mine </s>
<s> so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand </s>
<s> we shall
see if our styles suit </s>
<s> a fine young man certainly is frank churchill </s>
<s> 
i like him very well </s>
<s> 

at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not
but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear
more </s>
<s> and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till
another suspension brought <abvr> eltons tones again distinctly
forward </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming

oh </s>
<s>  you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion </s>
<s> i was
this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for
tidings of us </s>
<s> 

jane </s>
<s> repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and
displeasure </s>
<s> that is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i
suppose </s>
<s> 

how do you like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  said emma in a whisper </s>
<s> 

not at all </s>
<s> 

you are ungrateful </s>
<s> 

ungrateful </s>
<s> what do you mean </s>
<s>  then changing from a frown to a
smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you mean </s>
<s> where
is my father </s>
<s> when are we to begin dancing </s>
<s> 

emma could hardly understand him </s>
<s>  he seemed in an odd humour </s>
<s>  he walked
off to find his father but was quickly back again with both <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  weston </s>
<s>  he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be
laid before emma </s>
<s>  it had just occurred to <abvr> weston that <abvr> elton
must be asked to begin the ball </s>
<s>  that she would expect it </s>
<s>  which
interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction </s>
<s> emma
heard the sad truth with fortitude </s>
<s> 

and what are we to do for a proper partner for her </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
she will think frank ought to ask her </s>
<s> 

frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise </s>
<s>  and
boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect
approbation ofand it then appeared that <abvr> weston was wanting him
to dance with <abvr> elton himself and that their business was to help to
persuade him into it which was done pretty soon </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  weston and <abvr>
elton led the way <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed </s>
<s> 
emma must submit to stand second to <abvr> elton though she had always
considered the ball as peculiarly for her </s>
<s>  it was almost enough to make
her think of marrying </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this
time in vanity completely gratified </s>
<s>  for though she had intended to
begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
might be his sons superior </s>
<s> in spite of this little rub however
emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length
of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours
of unusual festivity before her </s>
<s> she was more disturbed by <abvr>
knightleys not dancing than by any thing else </s>
<s> there he was among
the standersby where he ought not to be </s>
<s>  he ought to be dancingnot
classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whistplayers who
were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were
made upso young as he looked </s>
<s> he could not have appeared to greater
advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself </s>
<s>  his tall
firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of
the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes </s>
<s> 
and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of
young men who could be compared with him </s>
<s> he moved a few steps nearer
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner
with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the
trouble </s>
<s> whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile </s>
<s>  but
in general he was looking grave </s>
<s>  she wished he could love a ballroom
better and could like frank churchill better </s>
<s> he seemed often
observing her </s>
<s>  she must not flatter herself that he thought of her
dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel
afraid </s>
<s>  there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner </s>
<s> 
they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers </s>
<s>  that frank
churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable </s>
<s> 

the ball proceeded pleasantly </s>
<s>  the anxious cares the incessant
attentions of <abvr> weston were not thrown away </s>
<s>  every body seemed
happy </s>
<s>  and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom
bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in
the very beginning of the existence of this </s>
<s>  of very important very
recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually
are </s>
<s>  there was one however which emma thought something of </s>
<s> the two
last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner </s>
<s> the
only young lady sitting down </s>
<s> and so equal had been hitherto the
number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the
wonder </s>
<s> but emmas wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing <abvr> elton
sauntering about </s>
<s>  he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible
to be avoided </s>
<s>  she was sure he would notand she was expecting him
every moment to escape into the cardroom </s>
<s> 

escape however was not his plan </s>
<s>  he came to the part of the room where
the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about in front
of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining
it </s>
<s>  he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or
speaking to those who were close to her </s>
<s> emma saw it </s>
<s>  she was not yet
dancing </s>
<s>  she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore
leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw
it all </s>
<s>  when she was halfway up the set the whole group were exactly
behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which
just then took place between him and <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  and she perceived that
his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only
listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances </s>
<s> the
kindhearted gentle <abvr> weston had left her seat to join him and say
do not you dance <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  to which his prompt reply was most
readily <abvr> weston if you will dance with me </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noi would get you a better partner than myself </s>
<s>  i am no
dancer </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great
pleasure i am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old
married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very
great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like <abvr>
gilbert </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady
disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith </s>
<s>  miss
smith </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i had not observed </s>
<s> you are extremely obligingand if i
were not an old married man </s>
<s> but my dancing days are over <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
you will excuse me </s>
<s>  any thing else i should be most happy to do at your
commandbut my dancing days are over </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston said no more </s>
<s>  and emma could imagine with what surprize and
mortification she must be returning to her seat </s>
<s>  this was <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the
amiable obliging gentle <abvr> elton </s>
<s> she looked round for a moment </s>
<s>  he
had joined <abvr> knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself
for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him
and his wife </s>
<s> 

she would not look again </s>
<s>  her heart was in a glow and she feared her
face might be as hot </s>
<s> 

in another moment a happier sight caught her </s>
<s> <abvr> knightley leading
harriet to the set </s>
<s> never had she been more surprized seldom more
delighted than at that instant </s>
<s>  she was all pleasure and gratitude
both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him </s>
<s>  and though
too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could
catch his eye again </s>
<s> 

his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good </s>
<s> 
and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for
the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment
and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features
announced </s>
<s>  it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever
flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted very
foolish </s>
<s>  she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though
growing very like her </s>
<s> she spoke some of her feelings by observing
audibly to her partner

knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith </s>
<s> very goodnatured
i declare </s>
<s> 

supper was announced </s>
<s>  the move began </s>
<s>  and miss bates might be heard from
that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and
taking up her spoon </s>

emma had no opportunity of speaking to <abvr> knightley till after supper </s>
<s> 
but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited
him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked </s>
<s>  he was warm in his
reprobation of <abvr> eltons conduct </s>
<s>  it had been unpardonable rudeness </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> eltons looks also received the due share of censure </s>
<s> 

they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he </s>
<s>  emma why is it
that they are your enemies </s>
<s> 

he looked with smiling penetration </s>
<s>  and on receiving no answer added

be </s>
<s> to that surmise you say nothing of course </s>
<s>  but confess emma
that you did want him to marry harriet </s>

i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me </s>

he shook his head </s>

was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet </s>

chapter iii


this little explanation with <abvr> knightley gave emma considerable
pleasure </s>
<s>  it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which
she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy </s>
<s> she was extremely
glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the
eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much
alike </s>
<s>  and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was
peculiarly gratifying </s>
<s>  the impertinence of the eltons which for a few
minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions </s>
<s>  and she looked forward
to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuation </s>
<s> from
harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the
ballroom she had strong hopes </s>
<s>  it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly
opened and she were enabled to see that <abvr> elton was not the superior
creature she had believed him </s>
<s>  the fever was over and emma could
harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious
courtesy </s>
<s>  she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for
supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther
requisite </s>
<s> harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and
mr </s>
<s>  knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer
must be before her </s>
<s> 

she was not to see frank churchill this morning </s>
<s>  he had told her that he
could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was
to be at home by the middle of the day </s>
<s>  she did not regret it </s>
<s> 

having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all
to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa
when the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered whom she
had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill with harriet
leaning on his armactually harriet </s>
<s> a moment sufficed to convince
her that something extraordinary had happened </s>
<s>  harriet looked white
and frightened and he was trying to cheer her </s>
<s> the iron gates and the
frontdoor were not twenty yards asunder </s>
<s> they were all three soon in
the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away </s>
<s> 

a young lady who faints must be recovered </s>
<s>  questions must be answered
and surprizes be explained </s>
<s>  such events are very interesting but the
suspense of them cannot last long </s>
<s>  a few minutes made emma acquainted
with the whole </s>
<s> 

miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at <abvr>
goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together and
taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough
for safety had led them into alarm </s>
<s> about half a mile beyond highbury
making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became
for a considerable stretch very retired </s>
<s>  and when the young ladies
had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small
distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a
party of gipsies </s>
<s>  a child on the watch came towards them to beg </s>
<s>  and
miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling
on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at
the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury </s>
<s> 
but poor harriet could not follow </s>
<s>  she had suffered very much from cramp
after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such
a return of it as made her absolutely powerlessand in this state and
exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain </s>
<s> 

how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more
courageous must be doubtful </s>
<s>  but such an invitation for attack could
not be resisted </s>
<s>  and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children
headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent
in look though not absolutely in word </s>
<s> more and more frightened she
immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a
shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill </s>
<s> she
was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving awaybut her
terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather
surrounded by the whole gang demanding more </s>
<s> 

in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and
conditioning they loud and insolent </s>
<s>  by a most fortunate chance his
leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance
at this critical moment </s>
<s>  the pleasantness of the morning had induced
him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road
a mile or two beyond highburyand happening to have borrowed a pair
of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to
restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a
few minutes </s>
<s>  he was therefore later than he had intended </s>
<s>  and being
on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them </s>
<s>  the
terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then
their own portion </s>
<s>  he had left them completely frightened </s>
<s>  and harriet
eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength
enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome </s>
<s> 
it was his idea to bring her to hartfield </s>
<s>  he had thought of no other
place </s>
<s> 

this was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and of
harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech </s>
<s> he dared
not stay longer than to see her well </s>
<s>  these several delays left him
not another minute to lose </s>
<s>  and emma engaging to give assurance of her
safety to <abvr> goddard and notice of there being such a set of people
in the neighbourhood to <abvr> knightley he set off with all the grateful
blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself </s>
<s> 

such an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young woman
thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain
ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain </s>
<s>  so emma thought at
least </s>
<s>  could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician
have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and
heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been
at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other </s>

more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and
foresight </s>
<s> especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her
mind had already made </s>
<s> 

it was a very extraordinary thing </s>
<s>  nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory </s>
<s>  no
rencontre no alarm of the kind </s>
<s> and now it had happened to the very
person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing
to pass by to rescue her </s>

knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this

attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for <abvr> elton </s>

it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting
consequences </s>
<s>  it was not possible that the occurrence should not be
strongly recommending each to the other </s>
<s> 

in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while
harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror

sensibility amused and delighted </s>

she soon felt that concealment must be impossible </s>
<s>  within half an hour
it was known all over highbury </s>

to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his

chapter iv


a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one
morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down
and hesitating thus began </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i should
like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then you know it
will be over </s>
<s> 

emma was a good deal surprized </s>
<s>  but begged her to speak </s>
<s>  there was a
seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her quite as much as her
words for something more than ordinary </s>
<s> 

it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have
no reserves with you on this subject </s>
<s>  as i am happily quite an altered
creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have
the satisfaction of knowing it </s>
<s>  i do not want to say more than is
necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and
i dare say you understand me </s>
<s> 

yes said emma i hope i do </s>
<s> 

how i could so long a time be fancying myself </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  cried harriet
warmly </s>
<s>  it seems like madness </s>
<s>  i can see nothing at all extraordinary
in him now </s>
<s> i do not care whether i meet him or notexcept that of the
two i had rather not see himand indeed i would go any distance round
to avoid himbut i do not envy his wife in the least </s>
<s>  i neither admire
her nor envy her as i have done </s>
<s>  she is very charming i dare say and
all that but i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall
never forget her look the other night </s>
<s> however i assure you miss
woodhouse i wish her no evil </s>
<s> no let them be ever so happy together
it will not give me another moments pang </s>
<s>  and to convince you that i
have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i ought to
have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kepti know that
very well blushing as she spoke </s>
<s> however now i will destroy it
alland it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you
may see how rational i am grown </s>
<s>  cannot you guess what this parcel
holds </s>
<s>  said she with a conscious look </s>
<s> 

not the least in the world </s>
<s> did he ever give you any thing </s>
<s> 

noi cannot call them gifts </s>
<s>  but they are things that i have valued
very much </s>
<s> 

she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most
precious treasures on the top </s>
<s>  her curiosity was greatly excited </s>
<s> 
harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience </s>
<s>  within
abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box
which harriet opened </s>
<s>  it was well lined with the softest cotton </s>
<s>  but
excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister </s>
<s> 

now said harriet you must recollect </s>
<s> 

no indeed i do not </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  i should not have thought it possible you could forget what
passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very last
times we ever met in it </s>
<s> it was but a very few days before i had my
sore throatjust before <abvr> and <abvr> john knightley camei think the
very evening </s>
<s> do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new
penknife and your recommending courtplaister </s>
<s> but as you had none
about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him </s>
<s>  and so i took
mine out and cut him a piece </s>
<s>  but it was a great deal too large and he
cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he
gave it back to me </s>
<s>  and so then in my nonsense i could not help making
a treasure of itso i put it by never to be used and looked at it now
and then as a great treat </s>
<s> 

my dearest harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma putting her hand before her face
and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear </s>
<s> 
remember it </s>
<s>  aye i remember it all now </s>
<s>  all except your saving this
relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the
finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none
about me </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  my sins my sins </s>
<s> and i had plenty all the while in my
pocket </s>
<s> one of my senseless tricks </s>
<s> i deserve to be under a continual
blush all the rest of my life </s>
<s> wellsitting down againgo onwhat
else </s>
<s> 

and had you really some at hand yourself </s>
<s>  i am sure i never suspected
it you did it so naturally </s>
<s> 

and so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake </s>
<s> 
 said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement </s>
<s>  and secretly she added to herself lord
bless me </s>
<s>  when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a
piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about </s>
<s>  i
never was equal to this </s>
<s> 

here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something
still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because
this is what did really once belong to him which the courtplaister
never did </s>
<s> 

emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure </s>
<s>  it was the end of an
old pencilthe part without any lead </s>
<s> 

this was really his said harriet </s>
<s> do not you remember one
morning </s>
<s> no i dare say you do not </s>
<s>  but one morningi forget exactly
the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that
evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook </s>
<s>  it was
about sprucebeer </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had been telling him something about
brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down </s>
<s>  but when he took out
his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and
it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the
table as good for nothing </s>
<s>  but i kept my eye on it </s>
<s>  and as soon as i
dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment </s>
<s> 

i do remember it cried emma </s>
<s>  i perfectly remember it </s>
<s> talking
about sprucebeer </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yesmr </s>
<s>  knightley and i both saying we
liked it and <abvr> eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too </s>
<s>  i
perfectly remember it </s>
<s> stop </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley was standing just here was
not he </s>
<s>  i have an idea he was standing just here </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i do not know </s>
<s>  i cannot recollect </s>
<s> it is very odd but i cannot
recollect </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  elton was sitting here i remember much about where i
am now </s>
<s> 

well go on </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  thats all </s>
<s>  i have nothing more to shew you or to sayexcept that
i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see
me do it </s>
<s> 

my poor dear harriet </s>
<s>  and have you actually found happiness in
treasuring up these things </s>
<s> 

yes simpleton as i was </s>
<s> but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i
could forget as easily as i can burn them </s>
<s>  it was very wrong of me you
know to keep any remembrances after he was married </s>
<s>  i knew it wasbut
had not resolution enough to part with them </s>
<s> 

but harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaister </s>
<s> i have not
a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister might be
useful </s>
<s> 

i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet </s>
<s>  it has a disagreeable
look to me </s>
<s>  i must get rid of every thing </s>
<s> there it goes and there is
an end thank heaven </s>
<s>  of <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

and when thought emma will there be a beginning of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s> 

she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already
made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no
fortune might be proved to have made harriets </s>
<s> about a fortnight
after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite
undesignedly </s>
<s>  emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the
information she received more valuable </s>
<s>  she merely said in the course
of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise
you to do so and soand thought no more of it till after a minutes
silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never
marry </s>
<s> 

emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was </s>
<s>  and after a
moments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied

never marry </s>
<s> this is a new resolution </s>
<s> 

it is one that i shall never change however </s>
<s> 

after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed fromi hope
it is not in compliment to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton indeed </s>
<s>  cried harriet indignantly </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  noand emma could
just catch the words so superior to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

she then took a longer time for consideration </s>
<s>  should she proceed no
farther </s>
<s> should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing </s>
<s> perhaps
harriet might think her cold or angry if she did </s>
<s>  or perhaps if she were
totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too
much </s>
<s>  and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such
an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly
resolved </s>
<s> she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at
once all that she meant to say and know </s>
<s>  plain dealing was always
best </s>
<s>  she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any
application of the sort </s>
<s>  and it would be safer for both to have the
judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed </s>
<s> she was decided
and thus spoke

harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning </s>
<s>  your
resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from
an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your
superior in situation to think of you </s>
<s>  is not it so </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose
indeed i am not so mad </s>
<s> but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a
distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of
the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so
proper in me especially </s>
<s> 

i am not at all surprized at you harriet </s>
<s>  the service he rendered you
was enough to warm your heart </s>
<s> 

service </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  it was such an inexpressible obligation </s>
<s> the very
recollection of it and all that i felt at the timewhen i saw him
cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before </s>
<s>  such a change </s>
<s>  in
one moment such a change </s>
<s>  from perfect misery to perfect happiness </s>
<s> 

it is very natural </s>
<s>  it is natural and it is honourable </s>
<s> yes
honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully </s>
<s> but that
it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise </s>
<s>  i do not
advise you to give way to it harriet </s>
<s>  i do not by any means engage
for its being returned </s>
<s>  consider what you are about </s>
<s>  perhaps it will be
wisest in you to check your feelings while you can </s>
<s>  at any rate do not
let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you </s>
<s>  be
observant of him </s>
<s>  let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations </s>
<s>  i
give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on
the subject </s>
<s>  i am determined against all interference </s>
<s>  henceforward i
know nothing of the matter </s>
<s>  let no name ever pass our lips </s>
<s>  we were very
wrong before </s>
<s>  we will be cautious now </s>
<s> he is your superior no doubt
and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature </s>
<s>  but
yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been
matches of greater disparity </s>
<s>  but take care of yourself </s>
<s>  i would not
have you too sanguine </s>
<s>  though however it may end be assured your
raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall
always know how to value </s>
<s> 

harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude </s>
<s>  emma was
very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend </s>
<s> 
its tendency would be to raise and refine her mindand it must be
saving her from the danger of degradation </s>
<s> 



chapter v


in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon
hartfield </s>
<s>  to highbury in general it brought no material change </s>
<s>  the
eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use
to be made of their barouchelandau </s>
<s>  and jane fairfax was still at her
grandmothers </s>
<s>  and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again
delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely
to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able
to defeat <abvr> eltons activity in her service and save herself from
being hurried into a delightful situation against her will </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly
taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike
him more </s>
<s>  he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit
of emma </s>
<s>  that emma was his object appeared indisputable </s>
<s>  every thing
declared it </s>
<s>  his own attentions his fathers hints his motherinlaws
guarded silence </s>
<s>  it was all in unison </s>
<s>  words conduct discretion and
indiscretion told the same story </s>
<s>  but while so many were devoting him
to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet <abvr> knightley
began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax </s>
<s>  he
could not understand it </s>
<s>  but there were symptoms of intelligence between
themhe thought so at leastsymptoms of admiration on his side which
having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely
void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emmas errors
of imagination </s>
<s>  she was not present when the suspicion first arose </s>
<s> 
he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons </s>
<s>  and he
had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from
the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place </s>
<s>  when he was
again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen </s>
<s> 
nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and
his fire at twilight

myself creating what i saw

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private
liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane </s>
<s> 

he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend
his evening at hartfield </s>
<s>  emma and harriet were going to walk </s>
<s>  he joined
them </s>
<s>  and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like
themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the
weather threatened rain </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> weston and their son miss bates
and her niece who had accidentally met </s>
<s>  they all united </s>
<s>  and on
reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of
visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in
and drink tea with him </s>
<s>  the randalls party agreed to it immediately </s>
<s>  and
after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened
to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouses most
obliging invitation </s>
<s> 

as they were turning into the grounds <abvr> perry passed by on horseback </s>
<s> 
the gentlemen spoke of his horse </s>
<s> 

by the bye said frank churchill to <abvr> weston presently what
became of <abvr> perrys plan of setting up his carriage </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had
any such plan </s>
<s> 

nay i had it from you </s>
<s>  you wrote me word of it three months ago </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  impossible </s>
<s> 

indeed you did </s>
<s>  i remember it perfectly </s>
<s>  you mentioned it as what
was certainly to be very soon </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry had told somebody and was
extremely happy about it </s>
<s>  it was owing to her persuasion as she
thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm </s>
<s>  you
must remember it now </s>
<s> 

upon my word i never heard of it till this moment </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  really never </s>
<s> bless me </s>
<s>  how could it be </s>
<s> then i must have
dreamt itbut i was completely persuadedmiss smith you walk as if
you were tired </s>

<s> 

what is this </s>
<s> what is this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> weston about perry and a
carriage </s>
<s>  is perry going to set up his carriage frank </s>
<s>  i am glad he can
afford it </s>
<s>  you had it from himself had you </s>
<s> 

no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from
nobody </s>
<s> very odd </s>
<s> i really was persuaded of <abvr> westons having
mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all
these particularsbut as she declares she never heard a syllable of
it before of course it must have been a dream </s>
<s>  i am a great dreamer </s>
<s> 
i dream of every body at highbury when i am awayand when i have gone
through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of <abvr> and <abvr>
perry </s>
<s> 

it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at enscombe </s>
<s>  perrys setting up his carriage </s>
<s>  and
his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his healthjust
what will happen i have no doubt some time or other </s>
<s>  only a little
premature </s>
<s>  what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream </s>
<s> 
and at others what a heap of absurdities it is </s>
<s>  well frank your dream
certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent </s>
<s> 
emma you are a great dreamer i think </s>
<s> 

emma was out of hearing </s>
<s>  she had hurried on before her guests to
prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of <abvr>
westons hint </s>
<s> 

why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject
there is no denying that <abvr> frank churchill might havei do not mean
to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes the oddest
dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge
that there was such an idea last spring </s>
<s>  for <abvr> perry herself
mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as
ourselvesbut it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only
thought of about three days </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry was very anxious that he should
have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning
because she thought she had prevailed </s>
<s>  jane dont you remember
grandmamas telling us of it when we got home </s>
<s>  i forget where we
had been walking tovery likely to randalls </s>
<s>  yes i think it was to
randalls </s>
<s>  <abvr> perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed
i do not know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence </s>
<s> 
she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go
beyond </s>
<s>  and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that
i know of </s>
<s>  at the same time i will not positively answer for my having
never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before
i am aware </s>
<s>  i am a talker you know </s>
<s>  i am rather a talker </s>
<s>  and now and
then i have let a thing escape me which i should not </s>

<s>  just behind </s>
<s>  perfectly remember
mrs </s>
<s>  perrys coming </s>
<s> extraordinary dream indeed </s>
<s> 

they were entering the hall </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightleys eyes had preceded miss
batess in a glance at jane </s>
<s>  from frank churchills face where
he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had
involuntarily turned to hers </s>
<s>  but she was indeed behind and too busy
with her shawl </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had walked in </s>
<s>  the two other gentlemen waited
at the door to let her pass </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley suspected in frank
churchill the determination of catching her eyehe seemed watching her
intentlyin vain however if it were sojane passed between them
into the hall and looked at neither </s>
<s> 

there was no time for farther remark or explanation </s>
<s>  the dream must be
borne with and <abvr> knightley must take his seat with the rest round the
large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and
which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her
father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke on which two of his
daily meals had for forty years been crowded </s>
<s>  tea passed pleasantly
and nobody seemed in a hurry to move </s>
<s> 

miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind
him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their
alphabetstheir box of letters </s>
<s>  it used to stand here </s>
<s>  where is it </s>
<s> 
this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought to be treated rather
as winter than summer </s>
<s>  we had great amusement with those letters one
morning </s>
<s>  i want to puzzle you again </s>
<s> 

emma was pleased with the thought </s>
<s>  and producing the box the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves </s>
<s>  they were rapidly forming words
for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled </s>
<s>  the quietness
of the game made it particularly eligible for <abvr> woodhouse who had
often been distressed by the more animated sort which <abvr> weston had
occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting
with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys
 or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how
beautifully emma had written it </s>
<s> 

frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax </s>
<s>  she gave a slight
glance round the table and applied herself to it </s>
<s>  frank was next to
emma jane opposite to themand <abvr> knightley so placed as to see them
all </s>
<s>  and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little
apparent observation </s>
<s>  the word was discovered and with a faint smile
pushed away </s>
<s>  if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and
buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of
looking just across for it was not mixed </s>
<s>  and harriet eager after
every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to
work </s>
<s>  she was sitting by <abvr> knightley and turned to him for help </s>
<s>  the
word was blunder </s>
<s>  and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a
blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  knightley connected it with the dream </s>
<s>  but how it could all be
was beyond his comprehension </s>
<s>  how the delicacy the discretion of his
favourite could have been so lain asleep </s>
<s>  he feared there must be some
decided involvement </s>
<s>  disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet
him at every turn </s>
<s>  these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and
trick </s>
<s>  it was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank
churchills part </s>
<s> 

with great indignation did he continue to observe him </s>
<s>  with great alarm
and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions </s>
<s>  he saw a short
word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure </s>
<s>  he
saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining
though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure </s>
<s> 
for she said nonsense </s>
<s>  for shame </s>
<s>  he heard frank churchill next say
with a glance towards jane i will give it to hershall i </s>
<s> and as
clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth </s>
<s>  no no you
must not </s>
<s>  you shall not indeed </s>
<s> 

it was done however </s>
<s>  this gallant young man who seemed to love without
feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed
over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate
civility entreated her to study it </s>

evidently displeased </s>
<s>  looked up and seeing herself watched blushed
more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not
know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even
an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word

attack and turned towards her aunt </s>

emma was extremely confused </s>

explanation </s>

really ashamed of having ever imparted them </s>

oh </s>

the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and <abvr>

chapter vi


after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from <abvr> and <abvr>
suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn </s>
<s>  no such
importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at
present </s>
<s>  in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted
to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had
been united such as the last accounts of <abvr> churchill whose health
seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of <abvr>
weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much
increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was
by the approach of it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton was very much disappointed </s>
<s>  it was the delay of a great deal
of pleasure and parade </s>
<s>  her introductions and recommendations must all
wait and every projected party be still only talked of </s>
<s>  so she thought
at first </s>
<s> but a little consideration convinced her that every thing
need not be put off </s>
<s>  why should not they explore to box hill though
the sucklings did not come </s>
<s>  they could go there again with them in the
autumn </s>
<s>  it was settled that they should go to box hill </s>
<s>  that there was
to be such a party had been long generally known </s>
<s>  it had even given the
idea of another </s>
<s>  emma had never been to box hill </s>
<s>  she wished to see what
every body found so well worth seeing and she and <abvr> weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither </s>
<s>  two or three more of the
chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a
quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and
preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the
eltons and the sucklings </s>
<s> 

this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but
feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from <abvr> weston
that he had been proposing to <abvr> elton as her brother and sister had
failed her that the two parties should unite and go together </s>
<s>  and that
as <abvr> elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she
had no objection </s>
<s>  now as her objection was nothing but her very great
dislike of <abvr> elton of which <abvr> weston must already be perfectly
aware it was not worth bringing forward again </s>
<s> it could not be done
without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife </s>
<s>  and
she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which
she would have done a great deal to avoid </s>
<s>  an arrangement which would
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of <abvr>
eltons party </s>
<s>  every feeling was offended </s>
<s>  and the forbearance of her
outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her
reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of <abvr> westons temper </s>
<s> 

i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably </s>
<s> 
but i thought you would </s>
<s>  such schemes as these are nothing without
numbers </s>
<s>  one cannot have too large a party </s>
<s>  a large party secures its
own amusement </s>
<s>  and she is a goodnatured woman after all </s>
<s>  one could not
leave her out </s>
<s> 

emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private </s>
<s> 

it was now the middle of june and the weather fine </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton
was growing impatient to name the day and settle with <abvr> weston as to
pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw every thing
into sad uncertainty </s>
<s>  it might be weeks it might be only a few days
before the horse were useable </s>
<s>  but no preparations could be ventured
on and it was all melancholy stagnation </s>
<s>  <abvr> eltons resources were
inadequate to such an attack </s>
<s> 

is not this most vexatious knightley </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s> and such weather
for exploring </s>
<s> these delays and disappointments are quite odious </s>
<s>  what
are we to do </s>
<s> the year will wear away at this rate and nothing
done </s>
<s>  before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful
exploring party from maple grove to kings weston </s>
<s> 

you had better explore to donwell replied <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  that may
be done without horses </s>
<s>  come and eat my strawberries </s>
<s>  they are ripening
fast </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so
for his proposal was caught at with delight </s>
<s>  and the oh </s>
<s>  i should like
it of all things was not plainer in words than manner </s>
<s>  donwell was
famous for its strawberrybeds which seemed a plea for the invitation </s>
<s> 
but no plea was necessary </s>
<s>  cabbagebeds would have been enough to tempt
the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere </s>
<s>  she promised him again
and again to comemuch oftener than he doubtedand was extremely
gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment
as she chose to consider it </s>
<s> 

you may depend upon me said she </s>
<s>  i certainly will come </s>
<s>  name your

<s>  you will allow me to bring jane fairfax </s>

<s> the rest i leave to you </s>
<s>  i have no objections at all to meeting
the hartfield family </s>

you certainly will meet them if i can prevail </s>

thats quite unnecessary </s>

is to be a morning scheme you know knightley </s>

shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging

<s>  nothing can be
more simple you see </s>
<s>  and jane will have such another </s>
<s>  there is to be
no form or paradea sort of gipsy party </s>
<s>  we are to walk about
your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under
trees </s>
<s> and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out
of doorsa table spread in the shade you know </s>
<s>  every thing as natural
and simple as possible </s>
<s>  is not that your idea </s>
<s> 

not quite </s>
<s>  my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the diningroom </s>
<s>  the nature and the simplicity of
gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is

<s>  when you are tired of eating
strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house </s>

<s>  and by the bye

anything

<s> 

wellbut if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely
clever </s>
<s> 

i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and
would spurn any bodys assistance </s>
<s> 

i wish we had a donkey </s>
<s>  the thing would be for us all to come on
donkeys jane miss bates and meand my caro sposo walking by </s>
<s>  i
really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey </s>
<s>  in a country life
i conceive it to be a sort of necessary </s>
<s>  for let a woman have ever
so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at
home </s>
<s> and very long walks you knowin summer there is dust and in
winter there is dirt </s>
<s> 

you will not find either between donwell and highbury </s>
<s>  donwell lane is
never dusty and now it is perfectly dry </s>
<s>  come on a donkey however if
you prefer it </s>
<s>  you can borrow <abvr> coles </s>
<s>  i would wish every thing to
be as much to your taste as possible </s>
<s> 

that i am sure you would </s>
<s>  indeed i do you justice my good friend </s>
<s> 
under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the
warmest heart </s>
<s>  as i tell <abvr> e </s>
<s>  you are a thorough humourist </s>
<s> yes
believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in
the whole of this scheme </s>
<s>  you have hit upon the very thing to please
me </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade </s>
<s>  he
wished to persuade <abvr> woodhouse as well as emma to join the party </s>
<s> 
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to
eat would inevitably make him ill </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse must not under the
specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at
donwell be tempted away to his misery </s>
<s> 

he was invited on good faith </s>
<s>  no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for
his easy credulity </s>
<s>  he did consent </s>
<s>  he had not been at donwell for two
years </s>
<s>  some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go
very well </s>
<s>  and he could sit still with <abvr> weston while the dear girls
walked about the gardens </s>
<s>  he did not suppose they could be damp now
in the middle of the day </s>
<s>  he should like to see the old house again
exceedingly and should be very happy to meet <abvr> and <abvr> elton and
any other of his neighbours </s>
<s> he could not see any objection at all to
his and emmas and harriets going there some very fine morning </s>
<s>  he
thought it very well done of <abvr> knightley to invite themvery kind
and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining out </s>
<s> he was not fond of dining
out </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was fortunate in every bodys most ready concurrence </s>
<s>  the
invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like
mrs </s>
<s>  elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment
to themselves </s>
<s> emma and harriet professed very high expectations of
pleasure from it </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston unasked promised to get frank over to
join them if possible </s>
<s>  a proof of approbation and gratitude which could
have been dispensed with </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightley was then obliged to say that
he should be glad to see him </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston engaged to lose no time in
writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come </s>
<s> 

in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to
box hill was again under happy consideration </s>
<s>  and at last donwell was
settled for one day and box hill for the nextthe weather appearing
exactly right </s>
<s> 

under a bright midday sun at almost midsummer <abvr> woodhouse was
safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of
this alfresco party </s>
<s>  and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the
abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was
happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what
had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not
to heat themselves </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  weston who seemed to have walked there on
purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when
all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and
sympathiser </s>
<s> 

it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was
satisfied of her fathers comfort she was glad to leave him and look
around her </s>
<s>  eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular
observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must
ever be so interesting to her and all her family </s>
<s> 

she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with
the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed
the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming
characteristic situation low and shelteredits ample gardens
stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with
all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sightand its abundance
of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance
had rooted up </s>
<s> the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike
it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many
comfortable and one or two handsome rooms </s>
<s> it was just what it ought
to be and it looked what it wasand emma felt an increasing respect

<s> some faults of temper john knightley had </s>

but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably </s>

was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the
strawberrybeds </s>

inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasy </s>

fears of his horse </s>

<s> she wished to see the whole extent </s>
<s> the
pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear </s>
<s> 

it was hot </s>
<s>  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered
dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one
another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which
stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed
the finish of the pleasure grounds </s>
<s> it led to nothing </s>
<s>  nothing but a
view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed
intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to
the house which never had been there </s>
<s>  disputable however as might be
the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and
the view which closed it extremely pretty </s>
<s> the considerable slope at
nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds </s>
<s>  and at half a mile distant was a bank of
considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood </s>
<s> and at
the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the
abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and
handsome curve around it </s>
<s> 

it was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind </s>
<s>  english verdure

oppressive </s>
<s> 

in this walk emma and <abvr> weston found all the others assembled </s>
<s>  and
towards this view she immediately perceived <abvr> knightley and harriet
distinct from the rest quietly leading the way </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley and
harriet </s>

<s>  but she was glad to see it </s>
<s> there
had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and
turned from her with little ceremony </s>
<s>  now they seemed in pleasant
conversation </s>
<s>  there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry
to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm </s>
<s>  but now
she feared it not </s>
<s>  it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of
prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in
blossom and light column of smoke ascending </s>
<s> she joined them at the
wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around </s>
<s>  he
was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc </s>
<s>  and emma
received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns </s>
<s>  i have
a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of
introducing robert martin </s>
<s> she did not suspect him </s>
<s>  it was too old
a story </s>
<s> robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet </s>
<s> they
took a few turns together along the walk </s>
<s> the shade was most
refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day </s>

the next remove was to the house </s>

were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come </s>

weston looked and looked in vain </s>

prevented coming </s>
<s> emma looked at harriet while the point was under
consideration </s>

the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see

intolerableand he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the

emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of
humour </s>
<s>  some people were always cross when they were hot </s>
<s>  such might be
his constitution </s>
<s>  and as she knew that eating and drinking were often
the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking
some refreshment </s>

diningroomand she humanely pointed out the door </s>
<s> 

nohe should not eat </s>

<s>  it would only make him
hotter </s>

attention to her father saying in secret

the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected </s>

with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill </s>

took it very composedly </s>

arrangement for the next days scheme they parted </s>
<s>  frank churchills
little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last
words to emma were

she smiled her acceptance </s>

was to take him back before the following evening </s>

chapter vii


they had a very fine day for box hill </s>
<s>  and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in
favour of a pleasant party </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston directed the whole officiating
safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good
time </s>
<s>  emma and harriet went together </s>
<s>  miss bates and her niece with
the eltons </s>
<s>  the gentlemen on horseback </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston remained with <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s>  nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there </s>
<s> 
seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body
had a burst of admiration on first arriving </s>
<s>  but in the general amount
of the day there was deficiency </s>
<s>  there was a languor a want of spirits
a want of union which could not be got over </s>
<s>  they separated too much
into parties </s>
<s>  the eltons walked together </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley took charge of
miss bates and jane </s>
<s>  and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill </s>
<s> 
and <abvr> weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better </s>
<s>  it seemed
at first an accidental division but it never materially varied </s>
<s>  <abvr> and
mrs </s>
<s>  elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable
as they could </s>
<s>  but during the two whole hours that were spent on the
hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties
too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any
cheerful <abvr> weston to remove </s>
<s> 

at first it was downright dulness to emma </s>
<s>  she had never seen frank
churchill so silent and stupid </s>
<s>  he said nothing worth hearinglooked
without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without knowing
what she said </s>
<s>  while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet
should be dull likewise </s>
<s>  and they were both insufferable </s>
<s> 

when they all sat down it was better </s>
<s>  to her taste a great deal better
for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object </s>
<s> 
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her </s>
<s> 
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared
forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay
and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission
to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating
period of their acquaintance </s>
<s>  but which now in her own estimation
meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must
have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very
well describe </s>
<s>  <abvr> frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together
excessively </s>
<s>  they were laying themselves open to that very phraseand
to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to
ireland by another </s>
<s>  not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any
real felicity </s>
<s>  it was rather because she felt less happy than she had
expected </s>
<s>  she laughed because she was disappointed </s>
<s>  and though she liked
him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship
admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning
back her heart </s>
<s>  she still intended him for her friend </s>
<s> 

how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come
today </s>
<s> if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all
the happiness of this party </s>
<s>  i had quite determined to go away again </s>
<s> 

yes you were very cross </s>
<s>  and i do not know what about except that you
were too late for the best strawberries </s>
<s>  i was a kinder friend than you
deserved </s>
<s>  but you were humble </s>
<s>  you begged hard to be commanded to come </s>
<s> 

dont say i was cross </s>
<s>  i was fatigued </s>
<s>  the heat overcame me </s>
<s> 

it is hotter today </s>
<s> 

not to my feelings </s>
<s>  i am perfectly comfortable today </s>
<s> 

you are comfortable because you are under command </s>
<s> 

your command </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> 

perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant selfcommand </s>
<s>  you had
somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own
management </s>
<s>  but today you are got back againand as i cannot be always
with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command
rather than mine </s>
<s> 

it comes to the same thing </s>
<s>  i can have no selfcommand without a
motive </s>
<s>  you order me whether you speak or not </s>
<s>  and you can be always
with me </s>
<s>  you are always with me </s>
<s> 

dating from three oclock yesterday </s>
<s>  my perpetual influence could not
begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before </s>
<s> 

three oclock yesterday </s>
<s>  that is your date </s>
<s>  i thought i had seen you
first in february </s>
<s> 

your gallantry is really unanswerable </s>
<s>  but lowering her voicenobody
speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking
nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people </s>
<s> 

i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively
impudence </s>
<s>  i saw you first in february </s>
<s>  let every body on the hill
hear me if they can </s>
<s>  let my accents swell to mickleham on one side
and dorking on the other </s>
<s>  i saw you first in february </s>
<s>  and then
whisperingour companions are excessively stupid </s>
<s>  what shall we do
to rouse them </s>
<s>  any nonsense will serve </s>
<s>  they shall talk </s>
<s>  ladies
and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is
presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking
of </s>
<s> 

some laughed and answered goodhumouredly </s>
<s>  miss bates said a great
deal </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouses presiding </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightleys answer was the most distinct </s>
<s> 

is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all
thinking of </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no nocried emma laughing as carelessly as she couldupon no
account in the world </s>
<s>  it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt
of just now </s>
<s>  let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking
of </s>
<s>  i will not say quite all </s>
<s>  there are one or two perhaps glancing
at <abvr> weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of
knowing </s>
<s> 

it is a sort of thing cried <abvr> elton emphatically which i
should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into </s>
<s>  though
perhaps as the chaperon of the partyi never was in any
circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women

her mutterings were chiefly to her husband </s>
<s>  and he murmured in reply

very true my love very true </s>
<s>  exactly so indeedquite unheard
ofbut some ladies say any thing </s>
<s>  better pass it off as a joke </s>
<s>  every
body knows what is due to you </s>
<s> 

it will not do whispered frank to emma </s>
<s>  they are most of them
affronted </s>
<s>  i will attack them with more address </s>
<s>  ladies and gentlemeni
am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of
knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires
something very entertaining from each of you in a general way </s>
<s>  here
are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very
entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one
thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeatedor two
things moderately cleveror three things very dull indeed and she
engages to laugh heartily at them all </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy </s>
<s> 
òthree things very dull indeed </s>
<s>  that will just do for me you know </s>
<s>  i
shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth
shant i </s>
<s>  looking round with the most goodhumoured dependence on every
bodys assentdo not you all think i shall </s>
<s> 

emma could not resist </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  maam but there may be a difficulty </s>
<s>  pardon mebut you will be
limited as to numberonly three at once </s>
<s> 

miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not
immediately catch her meaning </s>
<s>  but when it burst on her it could not
anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s> wellto be sure </s>
<s>  yes i see what she means turning to <abvr>
knightley and i will try to hold my tongue </s>
<s>  i must make myself very
disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend </s>
<s> 

i like your plan cried <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  agreed agreed </s>
<s>  i will do my
best </s>
<s>  i am making a conundrum </s>
<s>  how will a conundrum reckon </s>
<s> 

low i am afraid sir very low answered his son </s>
<s> but we shall be
indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way </s>
<s> 

no no said emma it will not reckon low </s>
<s>  a conundrum of <abvr>
westons shall clear him and his next neighbour </s>
<s>  come sir pray let me
hear it </s>
<s> 

i doubt its being very clever myself said <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  it is too much
a matter of fact but here it is </s>
<s> what two letters of the alphabet are
there that express perfection </s>
<s> 

what two letters </s>
<s> express perfection </s>

ah </s>

guess </s>
<s> i will tell you </s>
<s> m </s>
<s>  and a </s>
<s> emma </s>
<s> do you understand </s>
<s> 

understanding and gratification came together </s>
<s>  it might be a very
indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and
enjoy in itand so did frank and harriet </s>
<s> it did not seem to touch
the rest of the party equally </s>
<s>  some looked very stupid about it and <abvr>
knightley gravely said

this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and <abvr> weston
has done very well for himself </s>
<s>  but he must have knocked up every body
else </s>
<s>  perfection should not have come quite so soon </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  for myself i protest i must be excused said <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  i
really cannot attempti am not at all fond of the sort of thing </s>
<s>  i had
an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all
pleased with </s>
<s>  i knew who it came from </s>
<s>  an abominable puppy </s>
<s> you know
who i mean nodding to her husband </s>
<s>  these kind of things are very
well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire </s>
<s>  but quite out of
place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer </s>
<s> 
miss woodhouse must excuse me </s>
<s>  i am not one of those who have witty
things at every bodys service </s>
<s>  i do not pretend to be a wit </s>
<s>  i have a
great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to
judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue </s>
<s>  pass us if you please
mr </s>

<s>  we have nothing
clever to saynot one of us </s>
<s> 

yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering
consciousness </s>

woodhouse or any other young lady </s>

nothing </s>
<s>  shall we walk augusta </s>
<s> 

with all my heart </s>
<s>  i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot </s>
<s> 
come jane take my other arm </s>
<s> 

jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off </s>
<s> 
happy couple </s>
<s>  said frank churchill as soon as they were out of
hearing </s>
<s> how well they suit one another </s>
<s> very luckymarrying as they
did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place </s>
<s> they only knew
each other i think a few weeks in bath </s>
<s>  peculiarly lucky </s>
<s> for as to
any real knowledge of a persons disposition that bath or any public
place can giveit is all nothing </s>
<s>  there can be no knowledge </s>
<s>  it is
only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as
they always are that you can form any just judgment </s>
<s>  short of that it
is all guess and luckand will generally be illluck </s>
<s>  how many a man
has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest
of his life </s>
<s> 

miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own
confederates spoke now </s>
<s> 

such things do occur undoubtedly </s>
<s> she was stopped by a cough </s>
<s>  frank
churchill turned towards her to listen </s>
<s> 

you were speaking said he gravely </s>
<s>  she recovered her voice </s>
<s> 

i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be
very frequent </s>
<s>  a hasty and imprudent attachment may arisebut there is
generally time to recover from it afterwards </s>
<s>  i would be understood to
mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness
must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate
acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever </s>
<s> 

he made no answer </s>
<s>  merely looked and bowed in submission </s>
<s>  and soon
afterwards said in a lively tone

well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i
marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me </s>
<s>  will you </s>
<s>  turning to
emma </s>
<s>  will you chuse a wife for me </s>
<s> i am sure i should like any body
fixed on by you </s>

<s> 

by all means if you can </s>
<s> 

very well </s>
<s>  i undertake the commission </s>
<s>  you shall have a charming wife </s>
<s> 

she must be very lively and have hazle eyes </s>
<s>  i care for nothing else </s>
<s> 
i shall go abroad for a couple of yearsand when i return i shall come
to you for my wife </s>
<s>  remember </s>
<s> 

emma was in no danger of forgetting </s>
<s>  it was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling </s>
<s>  would not harriet be the very creature described </s>
<s> 
hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished </s>
<s> 
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment </s>
<s>  who could say </s>
<s> 
referring the education to her seemed to imply it </s>
<s> 

now maam said jane to her aunt shall we join <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

if you please my dear </s>
<s>  with all my heart </s>
<s>  i am quite ready </s>
<s>  i was
ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well </s>
<s>  we shall
soon overtake her </s>
<s>  there she isno thats somebody else </s>
<s>  thats one
of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her </s>
<s> well i
declare

they walked off followed in half a minute by <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston
his son emma and harriet only remained </s>
<s>  and the young mans spirits
now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant </s>
<s>  even emma grew tired at last of
flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about
with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended
to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her </s>
<s>  the
appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the
carriages was a joyful sight </s>
<s>  and even the bustle of collecting and
preparing to depart and the solicitude of <abvr> elton to have her
carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive
home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of
pleasure </s>
<s>  such another scheme composed of so many illassorted people
she hoped never to be betrayed into again </s>
<s> 

while waiting for the carriage she found <abvr> knightley by her side </s>
<s>  he
looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said

emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do </s>
<s>  a
privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it </s>
<s> 
i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance </s>
<s>  how could you be
so unfeeling to miss bates </s>
<s>  how could you be so insolent in your wit to
a woman of her character age and situation </s>
<s> emma i had not thought
it possible </s>
<s> 

emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off </s>
<s> 

nay how could i help saying what i did </s>
<s> nobody could have helped it </s>
<s> 
it was not so very bad </s>
<s>  i dare say she did not understand me </s>
<s> 

i assure you she did </s>
<s>  she felt your full meaning </s>
<s>  she has talked of
it since </s>
<s>  i wish you could have heard how she talked of itwith what
candour and generosity </s>
<s>  i wish you could have heard her honouring your
forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for
ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be
so irksome </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world </s>
<s> 
but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most
unfortunately blended in her </s>
<s> 

they are blended said he i acknowledge </s>
<s>  and were she prosperous
i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over
the good </s>
<s>  were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless
absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any
liberties of manner </s>
<s>  were she your equal in situationbut emma
consider how far this is from being the case </s>
<s>  she is poor </s>
<s>  she has sunk
from the comforts she was born to </s>
<s>  and if she live to old age must
probably sink more </s>
<s>  her situation should secure your compassion </s>
<s>  it was
badly done indeed </s>
<s>  you whom she had known from an infant whom she had
seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you
now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her
humble herand before her niece tooand before others many of whom
certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment
of her </s>

<s> 
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and
trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you
can do now </s>
<s> 

while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage </s>
<s>  it was
ready </s>
<s>  and before she could speak again he had handed her in </s>
<s>  he had
misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her
tongue motionless </s>
<s>  they were combined only of anger against herself
mortification and deep concern </s>
<s>  she had not been able to speak </s>
<s>  and on
entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcomethen reproaching
herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in
apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a
difference </s>
<s>  but it was just too late </s>
<s>  he had turned away and the horses
were in motion </s>
<s>  she continued to look back but in vain </s>
<s>  and soon with
what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and
every thing left far behind </s>
<s>  she was vexed beyond what could have been
expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal </s>
<s>  never had she felt so
agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life </s>
<s>  she was
most forcibly struck </s>
<s>  the truth of this representation there was no
denying </s>

<s>  how could she have been so brutal
so cruel to miss bates </s>
<s>  how could she have exposed herself to such ill
opinion in any one she valued </s>

saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness </s>
<s> 

time did not compose her </s>
<s>  as she reflected more she seemed but to feel
it more </s>
<s>  she never had been so depressed </s>
<s>  happily it was not necessary
to speak </s>
<s>  there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself
fagged and very willing to be silent </s>

down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to
check them extraordinary as they were </s>

chapter viii


the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all the
evening </s>
<s>  how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could
not tell </s>
<s>  they in their different homes and their different ways
might be looking back on it with pleasure </s>
<s>  but in her view it was
a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than
any she had ever passed </s>
<s>  a whole evening of backgammon with her father
was felicity to it </s>
<s>  there indeed lay real pleasure for there she
was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour to his comfort </s>

feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and
confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any
severe reproach </s>

she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling

bates should never againno never </s>

away the past she might hope to be forgiven </s>

her conscience told her so </s>
<s>  remiss perhaps more in thought than fact </s>
<s> 
scornful ungracious </s>
<s>  but it should be so no more </s>
<s>  in the warmth of true
contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should
be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse </s>

might see <abvr> knightley in her way </s>

ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers </s>

her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not </s>
<s> 

the ladies were all at home </s>
<s>  she had never rejoiced at the sound
before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs

deriving it except in subsequent ridicule </s>

there was a bustle on her approach </s>

<s> 
she heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry </s>

maid looked frightened and awkward </s>
<s>  hoped she would be pleased to wait a
moment and then ushered her in too soon </s>
<s>  the aunt and niece seemed both
escaping into the adjoining room </s>

looking extremely ill </s>

miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon
the bed and i am sure you are ill enough </s>
<s> 

poor old <abvr> bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not
quite understand what was going on </s>

emma seriously hoped she would </s>

emma was most sincerely interested </s>
<s>  her heart had been long growing
kinder towards jane </s>
<s>  and this picture of her present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but
pity </s>
<s>  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of
the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on
seeing <abvr> cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear
to see herself </s>
<s>  she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and
solicitudesincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected
from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for
miss fairfaxs advantage and comfort as possible </s>
<s>  it must be a severe
trial to them all </s>
<s>  she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel
campbells return </s>
<s> 

so very kind </s>
<s>  replied miss bates </s>
<s>  but you are always kind </s>
<s> 

there was no bearing such an always </s>
<s>  and to break through her dreadful
gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of

wheremay i ask </s>
<s> is miss fairfax going </s>
<s> 

to a <abvr> smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have the charge
of her three little girlsdelightful children </s>
<s>  impossible that any
situation could be more replete with comfort </s>

<s>  jane will be only four miles from maple grove </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes

yes our good <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the most indefatigable true friend </s>
<s>  she
would not take a denial </s>
<s>  she would not let jane say òno </s>
<s>  for when jane
first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning
we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided
against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention </s>
<s>  exactly
as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel
campbells return and nothing should induce her to enter into any
engagement at presentand so she told <abvr> elton over and over
againand i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her
mind </s>
<s> but that good <abvr> elton whose judgment never fails her saw
farther than i did </s>
<s>  it is not every body that would have stood out in
such a kind way as she did and refuse to take janes answer </s>
<s>  but she
positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as
jane wished her </s>
<s>  she would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it
was all settled that jane should go </s>
<s>  quite a surprize to me </s>
<s>  i had not
the least idea </s>
<s> jane took <abvr> elton aside and told her at once that
upon thinking over the advantages of <abvr> smallridges situation she
had come to the resolution of accepting it </s>
<s> i did not know a word of it
till it was all settled </s>
<s> 

you spent the evening with <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

yes all of us </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton would have us come </s>
<s>  it was settled so upon
the hill while we were walking about with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  òyou must
all spend your evening with us said sheòi positively must have you
all come </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley was there too was he </s>
<s> 

no not <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  he declined it from the first </s>
<s>  and though i
thought he would come because <abvr> elton declared she would not let him
off he did not </s>
<s> but my mother and jane and i were all there and
a very agreeable evening we had </s>
<s>  such kind friends you know miss
woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed
rather fagged after the mornings party </s>
<s>  even pleasure you know is
fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have
enjoyed it </s>
<s>  however i shall always think it a very pleasant party
and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it </s>
<s> 

miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been
making up her mind the whole day </s>
<s> 

i dare say she had </s>
<s> 

whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her
friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is
possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family </s>
<s> 

thank you dear miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  yes indeed there is every thing
in the world that can make her happy in it </s>
<s>  except the sucklings and
bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal
and elegant in all <abvr> eltons acquaintance </s>
<s>  <abvr> smallridge a most
delightful woman </s>
<s> a style of living almost equal to maple groveand as
to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there
are not such elegant sweet children anywhere </s>
<s>  jane will be treated with
such regard and kindness </s>
<s> it will be nothing but pleasure a life of
pleasure </s>
<s> and her salary </s>
<s> i really cannot venture to name her salary
to you miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  even you used as you are to great sums would
hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i
remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of
what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly
earned </s>
<s> 

you are so noble in your ideas </s>
<s> 

and when is miss fairfax to leave you </s>
<s> 

very soon very soon indeed </s>
<s>  thats the worst of it </s>
<s>  within a
fortnight </s>
<s>  <abvr> smallridge is in a great hurry </s>
<s>  my poor mother does not
know how to bear it </s>
<s>  so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and
say come maam do not let us think about it any more </s>
<s> 

her friends must all be sorry to lose her </s>
<s>  and will not colonel and
mrs </s>
<s>  campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their
return </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  jane says she is sure they will </s>
<s>  but yet this is such a situation
as she cannot feel herself justified in declining </s>
<s>  i was so astonished
when she first told me what she had been saying to <abvr> elton and when
mrs </s>
<s>  elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it </s>
<s>  it was
before teastayno it could not be before tea because we were
just going to cardsand yet it was before tea because i remember
thinkingoh </s>
<s>  no now i recollect now i have it </s>
<s>  something happened
before tea but not that </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton was called out of the room before
tea old john abdys son wanted to speak with him </s>
<s>  poor old john i
have a great regard for him </s>
<s>  he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven
years </s>
<s>  and now poor old man he is bedridden and very poorly with the
rheumatic gout in his jointsi must go and see him today </s>
<s>  and so will
jane i am sure if she gets out at all </s>
<s>  and poor johns son came to
talk to <abvr> elton about relief from the parish </s>
<s>  he is very well to do
himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing
of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help </s>
<s> 
and so when <abvr> elton came back he told us what john ostler had been
telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to
randalls to take <abvr> frank churchill to richmond </s>
<s>  that was what happened
before tea </s>
<s>  it was after tea that jane spoke to <abvr> elton </s>
<s> 

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this
circumstance was to her </s>
<s>  but as without supposing it possible that she
could be ignorant of any of the particulars of <abvr> frank churchills
going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence </s>
<s> 

what <abvr> elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the
accumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge of the
servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond
soon after the return of the party from box hillwhich messenger
however had been no more than was expected </s>
<s>  and that <abvr> churchill had
sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable
account of <abvr> churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming
back beyond the next morning early </s>
<s>  but that <abvr> frank churchill having
resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse
seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the
crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy
going a good pace and driving very steady </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it
caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject which already
engaged her mind </s>
<s>  the contrast between <abvr> churchills importance in
the world and jane fairfaxs struck her </s>
<s>  one was every thing the
other nothingand she sat musing on the difference of womans destiny
and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss
batess saying

aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte </s>
<s>  what is to become
of that </s>
<s> very true </s>
<s>  poor dear jane was talking of it just now </s>
<s> òyou
must go said she </s>
<s>  òyou and i must part </s>
<s>  you will have no business
here </s>
<s> let it stay however said she </s>
<s>  ògive it houseroom till colonel
campbell comes back </s>
<s>  i shall talk about it to him </s>
<s>  he will settle for
me </s>
<s>  he will help me out of all my difficulties </s>
<s> and to this day i do
believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters </s>
<s> 

now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte </s>
<s>  and the remembrance of
all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough </s>
<s> 
and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of
the good wishes which she really felt took leave </s>
<s> 



chapter ix


emmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted </s>
<s> 
but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting
with her father </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightley immediately got up and in a manner
decidedly graver than usual said

i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare
and therefore must now be gone directly </s>
<s>  i am going to london to spend
a few days with john and isabella </s>
<s>  have you any thing to send or say
besides the òlove which nobody carries </s>
<s> 

nothing at all </s>
<s>  but is not this a sudden scheme </s>
<s> 

yesratheri have been thinking of it some little time </s>
<s> 

emma was sure he had not forgiven her </s>
<s>  he looked unlike himself </s>
<s>  time
however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends
again </s>
<s>  while he stood as if meaning to go but not goingher father
began his inquiries </s>
<s> 

well my dear and did you get there safely </s>
<s> and how did you find my
worthy old friend and her daughter </s>
<s> i dare say they must have been very
much obliged to you for coming </s>
<s>  dear emma has been to call on <abvr>
and miss bates <abvr> knightley as i told you before </s>
<s>  she is always so
attentive to them </s>
<s> 

emmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise </s>
<s>  and with a
smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at <abvr>
knightley </s>
<s> it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in
her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that
had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured </s>
<s> 
he looked at her with a glow of regard </s>
<s>  she was warmly gratifiedand in
another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common
friendliness on his part </s>
<s> he took her hand </s>
<s> whether she had not
herself made the first motion she could not sayshe might perhaps
have rather offered itbut he took her hand pressed it and certainly
was on the point of carrying it to his lipswhen from some fancy or
other he suddenly let it go </s>
<s> why he should feel such a scruple why
he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not
perceive </s>
<s> he would have judged better she thought if he had not
stopped </s>
<s> the intention however was indubitable </s>
<s>  and whether it was
that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it
happened but she thought nothing became him more </s>
<s> it was with him
of so simple yet so dignified a nature </s>
<s> she could not but recall the
attempt with great satisfaction </s>
<s>  it spoke such perfect amity </s>
<s> he left
them immediately afterwardsgone in a moment </s>
<s>  he always moved with the
alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but
now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance </s>
<s> 

emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she
had left her ten minutes earlier </s>
<s> it would have been a great pleasure
to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> neither
would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she
knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have happened
at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it would have been
pleasanter </s>
<s> they parted thorough friends however </s>
<s>  she could not
be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished
gallantry </s>
<s> it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered
his good opinion </s>
<s> he had been sitting with them half an hour she
found </s>
<s>  it was a pity that she had not come back earlier </s>
<s> 

in the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness
of <abvr> knightleys going to london </s>
<s>  and going so suddenly </s>
<s>  and going on
horseback which she knew would be all very bad </s>
<s>  emma communicated her
news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified </s>
<s> 
it supplied a very useful checkinterested without disturbing him </s>
<s>  he
had long made up his mind to jane fairfaxs going out as governess and
could talk of it cheerfully but <abvr> knightleys going to london had
been an unexpected blow </s>
<s> 

i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably
settled </s>
<s>  <abvr> elton is very goodnatured and agreeable and i dare say
her acquaintance are just what they ought to be </s>
<s>  i hope it is a dry
situation and that her health will be taken good care of </s>
<s>  it ought to
be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me </s>
<s> 
you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor
was to us </s>
<s>  and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be
induced to go away after it has been her home so long </s>
<s> 

the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else
into the background </s>
<s>  an express arrived at randalls to announce the
death of <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  though her nephew had had no particular reason
to hasten back on her account she had not lived above sixandthirty
hours after his return </s>
<s>  a sudden seizure of a different nature from any
thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short
struggle </s>
<s>  the great <abvr> churchill was no more </s>
<s> 

it was felt as such things must be felt </s>
<s>  every body had a degree of
gravity and sorrow </s>
<s>  tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the
surviving friends </s>
<s>  and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where
she would be buried </s>
<s>  goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops
to folly she has nothing to do but to die </s>
<s>  and when she stoops to be
disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  churchill after being disliked at least twentyfive years was
now spoken of with compassionate allowances </s>
<s>  in one point she was fully
justified </s>
<s>  she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill </s>
<s>  the
event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of
imaginary complaints </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> churchill </s>
<s>  no doubt she had been suffering a great deal </s>
<s> 
more than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try the
temper </s>
<s>  it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults what
would <abvr> churchill do without her </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchills loss would be
dreadful indeed </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill would never get over it </s>
<s> even <abvr>
weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah </s>
<s>  poor woman
who would have thought it </s>
<s>  and resolved that his mourning should be as
handsome as possible </s>
<s>  and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her
broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady </s>
<s>  how it
would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both </s>
<s>  it was also
a very early speculation with emma </s>
<s>  the character of <abvr> churchill
the grief of her husbandher mind glanced over them both with awe and
compassionand then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might
be affected by the event how benefited how freed </s>
<s>  she saw in a moment
all the possible good </s>
<s>  now an attachment to harriet smith would have
nothing to encounter </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill independent of his wife was feared
by nobody </s>
<s>  an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his
nephew </s>
<s>  all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form
the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed </s>
<s> 

harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand </s>
<s> 
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing </s>
<s>  emma
was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance </s>
<s> 
they spoke therefore of <abvr> churchills death with mutual
forbearance </s>
<s> 

short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all
that was immediately important of their state and plans </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill
was better than could be expected </s>
<s>  and their first removal on the
departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very
old friend in windsor to whom <abvr> churchill had been promising a
visit the last ten years </s>
<s>  at present there was nothing to be done for
harriet </s>
<s>  good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible
on emmas side </s>
<s> 

it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose
prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose engagements
now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her
kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish </s>
<s>  she had scarcely
a stronger regret than for her past coldness </s>
<s>  and the person whom she
had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she
would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy </s>
<s>  she wanted
to be of use to her </s>
<s>  wanted to shew a value for her society and testify
respect and consideration </s>
<s>  she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day
at hartfield </s>
<s>  a note was written to urge it </s>
<s>  the invitation was refused
and by a verbal message </s>
<s>  miss fairfax was not well enough to write </s>
<s> 
 and when <abvr> perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared
that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against
her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe
headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the
possibility of her going to <abvr> smallridges at the time proposed </s>
<s> 
her health seemed for the moment completely derangedappetite quite
goneand though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing
touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension
of the family <abvr> perry was uneasy about her </s>
<s>  he thought she had
undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself
though she would not own it </s>
<s>  her spirits seemed overcome </s>
<s>  her
present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous
disorder </s>
<s> confined always to one room </s>
<s> he could have wished it
otherwiseand her good aunt though his very old friend he must
acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that
description </s>
<s>  her care and attention could not be questioned </s>
<s>  they were
in fact only too great </s>
<s>  he very much feared that miss fairfax derived
more evil than good from them </s>
<s>  emma listened with the warmest concern </s>
<s> 
grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some
way of being useful </s>
<s>  to take herbe it only an hour or twofrom
her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational
conversation even for an hour or two might do her good </s>
<s>  and the
following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language
she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any
hour that jane would namementioning that she had <abvr> perrys decided
opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient </s>
<s>  the answer was only
in this short note </s>
<s> 

miss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any
exercise </s>
<s> 

emma felt that her own note had deserved something better </s>
<s>  but it was
impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed
indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best
counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted </s>
<s>  in spite of the
answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to <abvr> batess
in the hope that jane would be induced to join herbut it would not
do </s>
<s> miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing
with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest
serviceand every thing that message could do was triedbut all in
vain </s>
<s>  miss bates was obliged to return without success </s>
<s>  jane was
quite unpersuadable </s>
<s>  the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her
worse </s>
<s> emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers </s>
<s> 
but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear
that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in </s>
<s> 
indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any
bodyany body at allmrs </s>
<s>  elton indeed could not be deniedand
mrs </s>
<s>  cole had made such a pointand <abvr> perry had said so muchbut
except them jane would really see nobody </s>
<s> 

emma did not want to be classed with the <abvr> eltons the <abvr> perrys
and the <abvr> coles who would force themselves anywhere </s>
<s>  neither could
she feel any right of preference herselfshe submitted therefore and
only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieces appetite and diet
which she longed to be able to assist </s>
<s>  on that subject poor miss bates
was very unhappy and very communicative </s>
<s>  jane would hardly eat any
thing </s>
<s> <abvr> perry recommended nourishing food </s>
<s>  but every thing
they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was
distasteful </s>
<s> 

emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an
examination of her stores </s>
<s>  and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note </s>
<s>  in half
an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss
bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent
back </s>
<s>  it was a thing she could not takeand moreover she insisted on
her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing </s>
<s> 

when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of
the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any
exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage
she could have no doubtputting every thing togetherthat jane was
resolved to receive no kindness from her </s>
<s>  she was sorry very sorry </s>
<s> 
her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable
from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and
inequality of powers </s>
<s>  and it mortified her that she was given so little
credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend </s>
<s>  but
she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of

chapter x


one morning about ten days after <abvr> churchills decease emma was
called downstairs to <abvr> weston who could not stay five minutes
and wanted particularly to speak with her </s>
<s> he met her at the
parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of
his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father

can you come to randalls at any time this morning </s>
<s> do if it be
possible </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston wants to see you </s>
<s>  she must see you </s>
<s> 

is she unwell </s>
<s> 

no no not at allonly a little agitated </s>
<s>  she would have ordered the
carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you
knownodding towards her fatherhumph </s>
<s> can you come </s>
<s> 

certainly </s>
<s>  this moment if you please </s>
<s>  it is impossible to refuse what
you ask in such a way </s>
<s>  but what can be the matter </s>
<s> is she really not
ill </s>
<s> 

depend upon mebut ask no more questions </s>
<s>  you will know it all in
time </s>
<s>  the most unaccountable business </s>
<s>  but hush hush </s>
<s> 

to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma </s>
<s>  something
really important seemed announced by his looks </s>
<s>  but as her friend was
well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father
that she would take her walk now she and <abvr> weston were soon out of
the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls </s>
<s> 

nowsaid emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gatesnow
mr </s>
<s>  weston do let me know what has happened </s>
<s> 

no nohe gravely replied </s>
<s> dont ask me </s>
<s>  i promised my wife to
leave it all to her </s>
<s>  she will break it to you better than i can </s>
<s>  do not
be impatient emma </s>
<s>  it will all come out too soon </s>
<s> 

break it to me cried emma standing still with terror </s>
<s> good
god </s>
<s> <abvr> weston tell me at once </s>
<s> something has happened in brunswick
square </s>
<s>  i know it has </s>
<s>  tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it
is </s>
<s> 

no indeed you are mistaken </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston do not trifle with me </s>
<s> consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in brunswick square </s>
<s>  which of them is it </s>
<s> i charge you
by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment </s>
<s> 

upon my word emma </s>
<s> 

your word </s>
<s> why not your honour </s>
<s> why not say upon your honour that
it has nothing to do with any of them </s>
<s>  good heavens </s>
<s> what can be to be
broke to me that does not relate to one of that family </s>
<s> 

upon my honour said he very seriously it does not </s>
<s>  it is not in
the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of
knightley </s>
<s> 

emmas courage returned and she walked on </s>
<s> 

i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you </s>
<s> 
i should not have used the expression </s>
<s>  in fact it does not concern
youit concerns only myselfthat is we hope </s>
<s> humph </s>
<s> in short my
dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it </s>
<s>  i dont
say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much
worse </s>
<s> if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls </s>
<s> 

emma found that she must wait </s>
<s>  and now it required little effort </s>
<s>  she
asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and
that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money
concernsomething just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the
circumstances of the familysomething which the late event at richmond
had brought forward </s>
<s>  her fancy was very active </s>
<s>  half a dozen natural
children perhapsand poor frank cut off </s>
<s> this though very
undesirable would be no matter of agony to her </s>
<s>  it inspired little more
than an animating curiosity </s>
<s> 

who is that gentleman on horseback </s>
<s>  said she as they
proceededspeaking more to assist <abvr> weston in keeping his secret
than with any other view </s>
<s> 

i do not know </s>
<s> one of the otways </s>
<s> not frank </s>
<s> it is not frank i
assure you </s>
<s>  you will not see him </s>
<s>  he is half way to windsor by this
time </s>
<s> 

has your son been with you then </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  yesdid not you know </s>
<s> well well never mind </s>
<s> 

for a moment he was silent </s>
<s>  and then added in a tone much more guarded
and demure

yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did </s>
<s> 

they hurried on and were speedily at randalls </s>
<s> well my dear said
he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now i hope you
will soon be better </s>
<s>  i shall leave you together </s>
<s>  there is no use in
delay </s>
<s>  i shall not be far off if you want me </s>
<s> and emma distinctly
heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the roomi have
been as good as my word </s>
<s>  she has not the least idea </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation
that emmas uneasiness increased </s>
<s>  and the moment they were alone she
eagerly said

what is it my dear friend </s>
<s>  something of a very unpleasant nature i
find has occurred </s>
<s> do let me know directly what it is </s>
<s>  i have been
walking all this way in complete suspense </s>
<s>  we both abhor suspense </s>
<s> 
do not let mine continue longer </s>
<s>  it will do you good to speak of your
distress whatever it may be </s>
<s> 

have you indeed no idea </s>
<s>  said <abvr> weston in a trembling voice </s>
<s> 
cannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to
hear </s>
<s> 

so far as that it relates to <abvr> frank churchill i do guess </s>
<s> 

you are right </s>
<s>  it does relate to him and i will tell you directly </s>
<s> 
 resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up </s>
<s>  he has
been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand </s>
<s>  it is
impossible to express our surprize </s>
<s>  he came to speak to his father on a
subjectto announce an attachment

she stopped to breathe </s>
<s>  emma thought first of herself and then of
harriet </s>
<s> 

more than an attachment indeed resumed <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  an
engagementa positive engagement </s>
<s> what will you say emmawhat will
any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are
engaged </s>
<s> nay that they have been long engaged </s>
<s> 

emma even jumped with surprize </s>
<s> and horrorstruck exclaimed

jane fairfax </s>
<s> good god </s>
<s>  you are not serious </s>
<s>  you do not mean it </s>
<s> 

you may well be amazed returned <abvr> weston still averting her eyes
and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover
you may well be amazed </s>
<s>  but it is even so </s>
<s>  there has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth and
kept a secret from every body </s>
<s>  not a creature knowing it but
themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor his </s>
<s> it is so
wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost
incredible to myself </s>
<s>  i can hardly believe it </s>
<s> i thought i knew him </s>
<s> 

emma scarcely heard what was said </s>
<s> her mind was divided between two
ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax </s>
<s>  and
poor harriet </s>
<s> and for some time she could only exclaim and require
confirmation repeated confirmation </s>
<s> 

well said she at last trying to recover herself </s>
<s>  this is a
circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at
all comprehend it </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s> engaged to her all the winterbefore either
of them came to highbury </s>
<s> 

engaged since octobersecretly engaged </s>
<s> it has hurt me emma very
much </s>
<s>  it has hurt his father equally </s>
<s>  some part of his conduct we
cannot excuse </s>
<s> 

emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend not to
understand you </s>
<s>  and to give you all the relief in my power be assured
that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are
apprehensive of </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston looked up afraid to believe </s>
<s>  but emmas countenance was as
steady as her words </s>
<s> 

that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my
present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i
did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to himnay
was attachedand how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder </s>
<s> 
fortunately however it did cease </s>
<s>  i have really for some time past
for at least these three months cared nothing about him </s>
<s>  you may
believe me <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  this is the simple truth </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston kissed her with tears of joy </s>
<s>  and when she could find
utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good
than any thing else in the world could do </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she </s>
<s>  on
this point we have been wretched </s>
<s>  it was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so </s>
<s> 
imagine what we have been feeling on your account </s>
<s> 

i have escaped </s>
<s>  and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful
wonder to you and myself </s>
<s>  but this does not acquit him <abvr> weston </s>
<s> 
and i must say that i think him greatly to blame </s>
<s>  what right had he
to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners
so very disengaged </s>
<s>  what right had he to endeavour to please as
he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with persevering
attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged to
another </s>
<s> how could he tell what mischief he might be doing </s>
<s> how could
he tell that he might not be making me in love with him </s>
<s> very wrong
very wrong indeed </s>
<s> 

from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine

and how could she bear such behaviour </s>
<s>  composure with a witness </s>
<s> 
to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman
before her face and not resent it </s>
<s> that is a degree of placidity
which i can neither comprehend nor respect </s>
<s> 

there were misunderstandings between them emma </s>
<s>  he said so expressly </s>
<s> 
he had not time to enter into much explanation </s>
<s>  he was here only a
quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow
the full use even of the time he could staybut that there had been
misunderstandings he decidedly said </s>
<s>  the present crisis indeed
seemed to be brought on by them </s>
<s>  and those misunderstandings might very
possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct </s>
<s> 

impropriety </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> westonit is too calm a censure </s>
<s>  much much
beyond impropriety </s>
<s> it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him
in my opinion </s>
<s>  so unlike what a man should be </s>
<s> none of that upright
integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of
trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of
his life </s>
<s> 

nay dear emma now i must take his part </s>
<s>  for though he has been wrong
in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having
many very many good qualities </s>
<s>  and

good god </s>
<s>  cried emma not attending to her </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  smallridge too </s>
<s> 
jane actually on the point of going as governess </s>
<s>  what could he mean by
such horrible indelicacy </s>
<s>  to suffer her to engage herselfto suffer her
even to think of such a measure </s>
<s> 

he knew nothing about it emma </s>
<s>  on this article i can fully acquit
him </s>
<s>  it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to himor at
least not communicated in a way to carry conviction </s>
<s> till yesterday i
know he said he was in the dark as to her plans </s>
<s>  they burst on him i do
not know how but by some letter or messageand it was the discovery of
what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him
to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on
his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of
concealment that had been carrying on so long </s>
<s> 

emma began to listen better </s>
<s> 

i am to hear from him soon continued <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  he told me at
parting that he should soon write </s>
<s>  and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now </s>
<s>  let
us wait therefore for this letter </s>
<s>  it may bring many extenuations </s>
<s>  it
may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to
be understood </s>
<s>  dont let us be severe dont let us be in a hurry to
condemn him </s>
<s>  let us have patience </s>
<s>  i must love him </s>
<s>  and now that i am
satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious
for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may </s>
<s>  they must
both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and
concealment </s>
<s> 

his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him
much harm </s>
<s>  well and how did <abvr> churchill take it </s>
<s> 

most favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely a
difficulty </s>
<s>  conceive what the events of a week have done in that family </s>
<s> 
while poor <abvr> churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a
hope a chance a possibility </s>
<s> but scarcely are her remains at rest in
the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite
to what she would have required </s>
<s>  what a blessing it is when undue
influence does not survive the grave </s>
<s> he gave his consent with very
little persuasion </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  thought emma he would have done as much for harriet </s>
<s> 

this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this
morning </s>
<s>  he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy some timeand
then came on hither </s>
<s>  but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle
to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you
he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour </s>
<s> he was very much
agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made him appear quite
a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before </s>
<s> in
addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so
very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion ofand there was
every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal </s>
<s> 

and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such
perfect secresy </s>
<s> the campbells the dixons did none of them know of
the engagement </s>
<s> 

emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush </s>
<s> 

none </s>
<s>  not one </s>
<s>  he positively said that it had been known to no being in
the world but their two selves </s>
<s> 

well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the
idea and i wish them very happy </s>
<s>  but i shall always think it a
very abominable sort of proceeding </s>
<s>  what has it been but a system of
hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treachery </s>
<s> to come among us with
professions of openness and simplicity </s>
<s>  and such a league in secret
to judge us all </s>
<s> here have we been the whole winter and spring
completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth
and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been
carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and
words that were never meant for both to hear </s>
<s> they must take the
consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not
perfectly agreeable </s>
<s> 

i am quite easy on that head replied <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i am very sure
that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not
have heard </s>
<s> 

you are in luck </s>
<s> your only blunder was confined to my ear when you
imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady </s>
<s> 

true </s>
<s>  but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss
fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her </s>
<s>  and
as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe </s>
<s> 

at this moment <abvr> weston appeared at a little distance from the window
evidently on the watch </s>
<s>  his wife gave him a look which invited him
in </s>
<s>  and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me
intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease
and incline him to be satisfied with the match </s>
<s>  let us make the best of
itand indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour </s>
<s>  it
is not a connexion to gratify </s>
<s>  but if <abvr> churchill does not feel that
why should we </s>
<s>  and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for
frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such
steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her
credit forand still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of
this one great deviation from the strict rule of right </s>
<s>  and how much may
be said in her situation for even that error </s>
<s> 

much indeed </s>
<s>  cried emma feelingly </s>
<s>  if a woman can ever be
excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane
fairfaxs </s>
<s> of such one may almost say that òthe world is not theirs
nor the worlds law </s>
<s> 

she met <abvr> weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance
exclaiming

a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word </s>
<s>  this was a
device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of
guessing </s>
<s>  but you really frightened me </s>
<s>  i thought you had lost half
your property at least </s>
<s>  and here instead of its being a matter of
condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation </s>
<s> i congratulate
you <abvr> weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the
most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter </s>
<s> 

a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as
right as this speech proclaimed </s>
<s>  and its happy effect on his spirits was
immediate </s>
<s>  his air and voice recovered their usual briskness </s>
<s>  he shook
her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in
a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think
the engagement no very bad thing </s>
<s>  his companions suggested only what
could palliate imprudence or smooth objections </s>
<s>  and by the time they
had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again
with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly
reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank
could possibly have done </s>

chapter xi


harriet poor harriet </s>
<s> those were the words </s>
<s>  in them lay the
tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her </s>
<s>  frank churchill had behaved very
ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much his
behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him </s>
<s>  it was the
scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account that gave the
deepest hue to his offence </s>
<s> poor harriet </s>
<s>  to be a second time the
dupe of her misconceptions and flattery </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley had spoken
prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend
to harriet smith </s>
<s> she was afraid she had done her nothing but
disservice </s>
<s> it was true that she had not to charge herself in this
instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of
the mischief </s>
<s>  with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise
never have entered harriets imagination </s>
<s>  for harriet had acknowledged
her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever
given her a hint on the subject </s>
<s>  but she felt completely guilty
of having encouraged what she might have repressed </s>
<s>  she might have
prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments </s>
<s>  her influence
would have been enough </s>
<s>  and now she was very conscious that she ought
to have prevented them </s>
<s> she felt that she had been risking her friends
happiness on most insufficient grounds </s>
<s>  common sense would have directed
her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him
and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring
for her </s>
<s> but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had
little to do </s>
<s> 

she was extremely angry with herself </s>
<s>  if she could not have been angry
with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful </s>
<s> as for jane
fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present
solicitude on her account </s>
<s>  harriet would be anxiety enough </s>
<s>  she need
no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose illhealth
having of course the same origin must be equally under cure </s>
<s> her
days of insignificance and evil were over </s>
<s> she would soon be well and
happy and prosperous </s>
<s> emma could now imagine why her own attentions
had been slighted </s>
<s>  this discovery laid many smaller matters open </s>
<s>  no
doubt it had been from jealousy </s>
<s> in janes eyes she had been a rival </s>
<s> 
and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be
repulsed </s>
<s>  an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison </s>
<s>  she
understood it all </s>
<s>  and as far as her mind could disengage itself from
the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that
jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her
desert </s>
<s>  but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge </s>
<s>  there was little
sympathy to be spared for any body else </s>
<s>  emma was sadly fearful
that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first </s>
<s> 
considering the very superior claims of the object it ought </s>
<s>  and
judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriets mind producing
reserve and selfcommand it would </s>
<s> she must communicate the painful
truth however and as soon as possible </s>
<s>  an injunction of secresy had
been among <abvr> westons parting words </s>
<s>  for the present the whole
affair was to be completely a secret </s>
<s>  <abvr> churchill had made a point of
it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost </s>
<s> 
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum </s>
<s> emma had
promised </s>
<s>  but still harriet must be excepted </s>
<s>  it was her superior duty </s>
<s> 

in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost
ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate
office to perform by harriet which <abvr> weston had just gone through by
herself </s>
<s>  the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another </s>
<s>  her heart beat quick
on hearing harriets footstep and voice </s>
<s>  so she supposed had poor <abvr>
weston felt when she was approaching randalls </s>
<s>  could the event of
the disclosure bear an equal resemblance </s>
<s> but of that unfortunately
there could be no chance </s>
<s> 

well miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  cried harriet coming eagerly into the roomis
not this the oddest news that ever was </s>
<s> 

what news do you mean </s>
<s>  replied emma unable to guess by look or
voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint </s>
<s> 

about jane fairfax </s>
<s>  did you ever hear any thing so strange </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s> you
need not be afraid of owning it to me for <abvr> weston has told me
himself </s>
<s>  i met him just now </s>
<s>  he told me it was to be a great secret </s>
<s> 
and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you
but he said you knew it </s>
<s> 

what did <abvr> weston tell you </s>
<s> said emma still perplexed </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  he told me all about it </s>
<s>  that jane fairfax and <abvr> frank churchill
are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one
another this long while </s>
<s>  how very odd </s>
<s> 

it was indeed so odd </s>
<s>  harriets behaviour was so extremely odd
that emma did not know how to understand it </s>
<s>  her character appeared
absolutely changed </s>
<s>  she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or
disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery </s>
<s>  emma looked at
her quite unable to speak </s>
<s> 

had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her </s>
<s> you
perhaps might </s>
<s> you blushing as she spoke who can see into every
bodys heart </s>
<s>  but nobody else

upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent </s>
<s> 
can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached
to another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not
openlyencouraging you to give way to your own feelings </s>
<s> i never
had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of <abvr> frank
churchills having the least regard for jane fairfax </s>
<s>  you may be very
sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  cried harriet colouring and astonished </s>
<s>  why should you caution
me </s>
<s> you do not think i care about <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s> 

i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied
emma smiling </s>
<s>  but you do not mean to deny that there was a timeand
not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason to understand that you
did care about him </s>
<s> 

him </s>
<s> never never </s>
<s>  dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me </s>
<s> 
 turning away distressed </s>
<s> 

harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you mean </s>
<s> good
heaven </s>
<s>  what do you mean </s>
<s> mistake you </s>
<s> am i to suppose then </s>
<s> 

she could not speak another word </s>
<s> her voice was lost </s>
<s>  and she sat down
waiting in great terror till harriet should answer </s>
<s> 

harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from
her did not immediately say any thing </s>
<s>  and when she did speak it was
in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas </s>
<s> 

i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have
misunderstood me </s>
<s>  i know we agreed never to name himbut considering
how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have
thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill indeed </s>
<s>  i do not know who would ever look at him in
the company of the other </s>
<s>  i hope i have a better taste than to think of
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill who is like nobody by his side </s>
<s>  and that you should
have been so mistaken is amazing </s>
<s> i am sure but for believing that
you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i
should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost
to dare to think of him </s>
<s>  at first if you had not told me that more
wonderful things had happened </s>
<s>  that there had been matches of greater
disparity those were your very words </s>
<s> i should not have dared to
give way toi should not have thought it possiblebut if you who
had been always acquainted with him

harriet </s>
<s>  cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us understand
each other now without the possibility of farther mistake </s>
<s>  are you
speaking ofmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> 

to be sure i am </s>
<s>  i never could have an idea of any body elseand so
i thought you knew </s>
<s>  when we talked about him it was as clear as
possible </s>
<s> 

not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then
said appeared to me to relate to a different person </s>
<s>  i could almost
assert that you had named <abvr> frank churchill </s>
<s>  i am sure the service
mr </s>
<s>  frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the
gipsies was spoken of </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  miss woodhouse how you do forget </s>
<s> 

my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on
the occasion </s>
<s>  i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment </s>
<s>

oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean </s>
<s>  but i
was thinking of something very different at the time </s>
<s>  it was not the
gipsiesit was not <abvr> frank churchill that i meant </s>

stand up with me </s>

<s>  that
was the kind action </s>

good god </s>

you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me </s>

she paused a few moments </s>

i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a

<s>  you must
think one five hundred million times more above me than the other </s>

things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than

not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way </s>

harriet was standing at one of the windows </s>
<s>  emma turned round to look at
her in consternation and hastily said

have you any idea of <abvr> knightleys returning your affection </s>
<s> 

yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say that i
have </s>
<s> 

emmas eyes were instantly withdrawn </s>
<s>  and she sat silently meditating
in a fixed attitude for a few minutes </s>
<s>  a few minutes were sufficient
for making her acquainted with her own heart </s>
<s>  a mind like hers
once opening to suspicion made rapid progress </s>
<s>  she touchedshe
admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth </s>
<s>  why was it so much worse
that harriet should be in love with <abvr> knightley than with frank
churchill </s>
<s>  why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriets having
some hope of a return </s>
<s>  it darted through her with the speed of an
arrow that <abvr> knightley must marry no one but herself </s>
<s> 

her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same
few minutes </s>
<s>  she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed
her before </s>
<s>  how improperly had she been acting by harriet </s>
<s>  how
inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been
her conduct </s>
<s>  what blindness what madness had led her on </s>
<s>  it struck her
with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the
world </s>
<s>  some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all
these demeritssome concern for her own appearance and a strong sense
of justice by harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the
girl who believed herself loved by <abvr> knightleybut justice required
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the
resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent
kindness </s>
<s> for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost
extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into </s>
<s>  and harriet had done
nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily
formed and maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by the person whose
counsels had never led her right </s>
<s> rousing from reflection therefore

inviting accent renewed the conversation </s>
<s>  for as to the subject which
had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was
quite sunk and lost </s>
<s> neither of them thought but of <abvr> knightley and
themselves </s>
<s> 

harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad
to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and
such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give
the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight </s>
<s> emmas
tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than
harriets but they were not less </s>

<s>  but her
mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such

emotions must create </s>
<s> she listened with much inward suffering but
with great outward patience to harriets detail </s>
<s> methodical or well
arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be </s>
<s>  but it
contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of
the narration a substance to sink her spiritespecially with the
corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys most improved opinion of harriet </s>
<s> 

harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances </s>
<s> emma knew that he had on that occasion
found her much superior to his expectation </s>
<s>  from that evening or at
least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her to think of him
harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he
had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner
towards her </s>
<s>  a manner of kindness and sweetness </s>
<s> latterly she had been
more and more aware of it </s>
<s>  when they had been all walking together
he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very
delightfully </s>
<s> he seemed to want to be acquainted with her </s>
<s>  emma knew it
to have been very much the case </s>
<s>  she had often observed the change to
almost the same extent </s>
<s> harriet repeated expressions of approbation
and praise from himand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement
with what she had known of his opinion of harriet </s>
<s>  he praised her for
being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous
feelings </s>
<s> she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet </s>
<s>  he
had dwelt on them to her more than once </s>
<s> much that lived in harriets
memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from
him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment
implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected
by emma </s>
<s>  circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed
undiscerned by her who now heard them </s>
<s>  but the two latest occurrences to
be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without
some degree of witness from emma herself </s>
<s> the first was his walking
with her apart from the others in the limewalk at donwell where they
had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as
she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first
he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done
before in a very particular way indeed </s>
<s> harriet could not recall
it without a blush </s>
<s>  he seemed to be almost asking her whether her
affections were engaged </s>
<s> but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared
likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about
farming </s>
<s> the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half
an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of
his being at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said that
he could not stay five minutesand his having told her during their
conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against
his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as
emma felt than he had acknowledged to her </s>
<s>  the superior degree of
confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her
severe pain </s>
<s> 

on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a
little reflection venture the following question </s>
<s>  might he not </s>
<s> is
not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of
your affections he might be alluding to <abvr> martinhe might have
mr </s>
<s>  martins interest in view </s>
<s>  but harriet rejected the suspicion with
spirit </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  martin </s>
<s>  no indeed </s>
<s> there was not a hint of <abvr> martin </s>
<s>  i hope i
know better now than to care for <abvr> martin or to be suspected of it </s>
<s> 

when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss
woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope </s>
<s> 

i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but
for you </s>
<s>  you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour
be the rule of mineand so i have </s>
<s>  but now i seem to feel that i may
deserve him </s>
<s>  and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so
very wonderful </s>
<s> 

the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings
made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side to enable her to say
on reply

harriet i will only venture to declare that <abvr> knightley is the last
man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his
feeling for her more than he really does </s>
<s> 

harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so
satisfactory </s>
<s>  and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which
at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her
fathers footsteps </s>
<s>  he was coming through the hall </s>
<s>  harriet was too
much agitated to encounter him </s>
<s>  she could not compose herself
mr </s>
<s>  woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better go </s>
<s> with most ready
encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another
doorand the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of
emmas feelings </s>
<s>  oh god </s>
<s>  that i had never seen her </s>
<s> 

the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her
thoughts </s>
<s> she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had
rushed on her within the last few hours </s>
<s>  every moment had brought a
fresh surprize </s>
<s>  and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to
her </s>
<s> how to understand it all </s>
<s>  how to understand the deceptions she had
been thus practising on herself and living under </s>
<s> the blunders the
blindness of her own head and heart </s>
<s> she sat still she walked about
she tried her own room she tried the shrubberyin every place every
posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly </s>
<s>  that she had
been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree </s>
<s>  that she had
been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying </s>
<s>  that she
was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of
wretchedness </s>
<s> 

to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first
endeavour </s>
<s>  to that point went every leisure moment which her fathers
claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind </s>
<s> 

how long had <abvr> knightley been so dear to her as every feeling
declared him now to be </s>
<s>  when had his influence such influence begun </s>
<s> 
when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank
churchill had once for a short period occupied </s>
<s> she looked back </s>
<s> 
she compared the twocompared them as they had always stood in her
estimation from the time of the latters becoming known to herand as
they must at any time have been compared by her had itoh </s>
<s>  had it by
any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison </s>
<s> she
saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider <abvr>
knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not
been infinitely the most dear </s>
<s>  she saw that in persuading herself
in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a
delusion totally ignorant of her own heartand in short that she had
never really cared for frank churchill at all </s>
<s> 

this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection </s>
<s>  this was
the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which
she reached </s>
<s>  and without being long in reaching it </s>
<s> she was most
sorrowfully indignant </s>
<s>  ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed
to herher affection for <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> every other part of her mind
was disgusting </s>
<s> 

with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every

<s>  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every

<s> 

mr </s>

too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him </s>
<s> was
it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent

chapter xii


till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known
how much of her happiness depended on being first with <abvr> knightley
first in interest and affection </s>
<s> satisfied that it was so and feeling
it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection </s>
<s>  and only in the
dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had
been </s>
<s> long very long she felt she had been first </s>
<s>  for having no
female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims
could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far
he loved and esteemed isabella </s>
<s>  she had herself been first with him for
many years past </s>
<s>  she had not deserved it </s>
<s>  she had often been negligent
or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him
insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would
not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her ownbut still
from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he
had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to
improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature
had at all shared </s>
<s>  in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear
to him </s>
<s>  might she not say very dear </s>
<s> when the suggestions of hope
however which must follow here presented themselves she could not
presume to indulge them </s>
<s>  harriet smith might think herself not unworthy
of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 
she could not </s>
<s>  she could not flatter herself with any idea of
blindness in his attachment to her </s>
<s>  she had received a very recent
proof of its impartiality </s>
<s> how shocked had he been by her behaviour to
miss bates </s>
<s>  how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her
on the subject </s>
<s> not too strongly for the offencebut far far too
strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and
clearsighted goodwill </s>
<s> she had no hope nothing to deserve the name
of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was
now in question </s>
<s>  but there was a hope at times a slight one at
times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be
overrating his regard for her </s>
<s> wish it she must for his sakebe the
consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life </s>
<s> 
could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she
believed she should be perfectly satisfied </s>
<s> let him but continue the
same <abvr> knightley to her and her father the same <abvr> knightley to
all the world </s>
<s>  let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious
intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be
fully secured </s>
<s> marriage in fact would not do for her </s>
<s>  it would be
incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt
for him </s>
<s>  nothing should separate her from her father </s>
<s>  she would not
marry even if she were asked by <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> 

it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed </s>
<s>  and she
hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least
be able to ascertain what the chances for it were </s>
<s> she should see them
henceforward with the closest observance </s>
<s>  and wretchedly as she had
hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how
to admit that she could be blinded here </s>
<s> he was expected back every
day </s>
<s>  the power of observation would be soon givenfrightfully soon it
appeared when her thoughts were in one course </s>
<s>  in the meanwhile she
resolved against seeing harriet </s>
<s> it would do neither of them good
it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther </s>
<s> she was
resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had
no authority for opposing harriets confidence </s>
<s>  to talk would be only to
irritate </s>
<s> she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg
that she would not at present come to hartfield </s>
<s>  acknowledging it to
be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one
topic had better be avoided </s>
<s>  and hoping that if a few days were allowed
to pass before they met again except in the company of othersshe

approved and was grateful </s>

mr </s>

induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with

<s> 

a little curiosity emma had </s>
<s>  and she made the most of it while her
friend related </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal
of agitation herself </s>
<s>  and in the first place had wished not to go at all
at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and
to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and <abvr>
churchill could be reconciled to the engagements becoming known </s>
<s>  as
considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid
without leading to reports </s>
<s> but <abvr> weston had thought differently </s>
<s>  he
was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her
family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it </s>
<s> 
or if it were that it would be of any consequence </s>
<s>  for such things
 he observed always got about </s>
<s>  emma smiled and felt that <abvr> weston
had very good reason for saying so </s>
<s>  they had gone in shortand very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady </s>
<s>  she had
hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn
how deeply she was suffering from consciousness </s>
<s>  the quiet heartfelt
satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her
daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a
gratifying yet almost an affecting scene </s>
<s>  they were both so truly
respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation </s>
<s> 
thought so much of jane </s>
<s>  so much of every body and so little of
themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them </s>
<s>  miss
fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea for <abvr> weston to
invite her to an airing </s>
<s>  she had drawn back and declined at first but
on being pressed had yielded </s>
<s>  and in the course of their drive
mrs </s>
<s>  weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her
embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject </s>
<s> 
apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception
and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling
towards herself and <abvr> weston must necessarily open the cause </s>
<s>  but
when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the
present and of the future state of the engagement </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was
convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her
companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been
and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject </s>
<s> 

on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so
many months continued <abvr> weston she was energetic </s>
<s>  this was one
of her expressions </s>
<s>  òi will not say that since i entered into the
engagement i have not had some happy moments </s>
<s>  but i can say that i have
never known the blessing of one tranquil hour </s>
<s> and the quivering lip
emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart </s>
<s>

<s>  said emma </s>
<s>  she thinks herself wrong then for having
consented to a private engagement </s>

<s>  no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed

<s>

<s>  said emma again </s>
<s>  she loves him then excessively i

<s>  it must have been from attachment only that she could be

contributed to make her unhappy </s>
<s> 

on your side my love it was very innocently done </s>
<s>  but she
probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the
misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before </s>
<s>  one natural
consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was
that of making her unreasonable </s>

amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious
and irritable to a degree that must have beenthat had beenhard for
him to bear </s>
<s>  òi did not make the allowances said she òwhich i ought
to have done for his temper and spiritshis delightful spirits and
that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other
circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to
me as they were at first </s>
<s>  she then began to speak of you and of the
great kindness you had shewn her during her illness </s>
<s>  and with a blush
which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had
an opportunity to thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every
wish and every endeavour to do her good </s>
<s>  she was sensible that you had
never received any proper acknowledgment from herself </s>
<s> 

if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which
in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she
must be i could not bear these thanks </s>
<s> for oh </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston if there

her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace in a thousand instances </s>

box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no

the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield </s>
<s> 
the weather added what it could of gloom </s>
<s>  a cold stormy rain set in and
nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was
despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights
the longer visible </s>
<s> 

the weather affected <abvr> woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side and by
exertions which had never cost her half so much before </s>
<s>  it reminded
her of their first forlorn teteatete on the evening of <abvr> westons
weddingday </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley had walked in then soon after tea
and dissipated every melancholy fancy </s>
<s>  alas </s>
<s>  such delightful proofs of
hartfields attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly
be over </s>
<s>  the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the
approaching winter had proved erroneous </s>
<s>  no friends had deserted them
no pleasures had been lost </s>

would experience no similar contradiction </s>
<s>  the prospect before her now
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelledthat
might not be even partially brightened </s>
<s>  if all took place that
might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be
comparatively deserted </s>
<s>  and she left to cheer her father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness </s>
<s> 

the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than
herself </s>
<s>  and <abvr> westons heart and time would be occupied by it </s>
<s> 
they should lose her </s>
<s>  and probably in great measure her husband
also </s>
<s> frank churchill would return among them no more </s>
<s>  and miss
fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to
highbury </s>
<s>  they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe </s>
<s> 
all that were good would be withdrawn </s>
<s>  and if to these losses the
loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or
of rational society within their reach </s>

it to be endured </s>

own work </s>
<s> 

when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from
a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a
few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better
conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might
be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it
would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and
leave her less to regret when it were gone </s>

chapter xiii


the weather continued much the same all the following morning </s>
<s>  and
the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at
hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared </s>
<s>  the wind changed into a
softer quarter </s>
<s>  the clouds were carried off </s>
<s>  the sun appeared </s>
<s>  it was
summer again </s>
<s>  with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma
resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible </s>

sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after
a storm been more attractive to her </s>
<s>  she longed for the serenity they
might gradually introduce </s>
<s>  and on <abvr> perrys coming in soon after
dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time
in hurrying into the shrubbery </s>
<s> there with spirits freshened and
thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw <abvr>
knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her </s>
<s> it
was the first intimation of his being returned from london </s>
<s>  she had
been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles
distant </s>
<s> there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind </s>
<s>  she
must be collected and calm </s>
<s>  in half a minute they were together </s>
<s>  the
how dye dos were quiet and constrained on each side </s>
<s>  she asked after
their mutual friends </s>
<s>  they were all well </s>
<s> when had he left them </s>
<s> only
that morning </s>
<s>  he must have had a wet ride </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> he meant to walk with
her she found </s>
<s>  he had just looked into the diningroom and as he was
not wanted there preferred being out of doors </s>
<s> she thought he neither
looked nor spoke cheerfully </s>
<s>  and the first possible cause for it
suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his
plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had
been received </s>
<s> 

they walked together </s>
<s>  he was silent </s>
<s>  she thought he was often looking
at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to
give </s>
<s>  and this belief produced another dread </s>
<s>  perhaps he wanted to
speak to her of his attachment to harriet </s>
<s>  he might be watching for
encouragement to begin </s>
<s> she did not could not feel equal to lead the
way to any such subject </s>
<s>  he must do it all himself </s>
<s>  yet she could
not bear this silence </s>
<s>  with him it was most unnatural </s>
<s>  she
consideredresolvedand trying to smile began

you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather
surprize you </s>
<s> 

have i </s>
<s>  said he quietly and looking at her </s>
<s>  of what nature </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  the best nature in the worlda wedding </s>
<s> 

after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he
replied

if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that
already </s>
<s> 

how is it possible </s>
<s>  cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards
him </s>
<s>  for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called
at <abvr> goddards in his way </s>
<s> 

i had a few lines on parish business from <abvr> weston this morning and
at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened </s>
<s> 

emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more
composure

you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have
had your suspicions </s>
<s> i have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution </s>
<s> i wish i had attended to itbutwith a sinking voice
and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness </s>
<s> 

for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having
excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within
his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone
of great sensibility speaking low

time my dearest emma time will heal the wound </s>
<s> your own excellent
senseyour exertions for your fathers sakei know you will not allow
yourself </s>
<s>  her arm was pressed again as he added in a more
broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest
friendshipindignationabominable scoundrel </s>
<s> and in a louder
steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone </s>
<s>  they will soon
be in yorkshire </s>
<s>  i am sorry for her </s>
<s>  she deserves a better fate </s>
<s> 

emma understood him </s>
<s>  and as soon as she could recover from the flutter
of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied

you are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right </s>
<s> 
i am not in want of that sort of compassion </s>
<s>  my blindness to what was
going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed
of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may
well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason
to regret that i was not in the secret earlier </s>
<s> 

emma </s>
<s>  cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed </s>
<s> but
checking himselfno no i understand youforgive mei am pleased
that you can say even so much </s>
<s> he is no object of regret indeed </s>
<s>  and
it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment
of more than your reason </s>
<s> fortunate that your affections were not
farther entangled </s>
<s> i could never i confess from your manners assure
myself as to the degree of what you felti could only be certain that
there was a preferenceand a preference which i never believed him to
deserve </s>
<s> he is a disgrace to the name of man </s>
<s> and is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman </s>
<s> jane jane you will be a miserable
creature </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confusedi
am in a very extraordinary situation </s>
<s>  i cannot let you continue in your
error </s>
<s>  and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i
have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been
at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural
for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse </s>
<s> but i never
have </s>
<s> 

he listened in perfect silence </s>
<s>  she wished him to speak but he would
not </s>
<s>  she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his
clemency </s>
<s>  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in
his opinion </s>
<s>  she went on however </s>
<s> 

i have very little to say for my own conduct </s>
<s> i was tempted by his
attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased </s>
<s> an old story
probablya common caseand no more than has happened to hundreds of my
sex before </s>
<s>  and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up
as i do for understanding </s>
<s>  many circumstances assisted the temptation </s>
<s> 
he was the son of <abvr> westonhe was continually herei always found
him very pleasantand in short for with a sigh let me swell out the
causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at lastmy vanity
was flattered and i allowed his attentions </s>
<s>  latterly howeverfor some
time indeedi have had no idea of their meaning any thing </s>
<s> i thought
them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side </s>
<s> 
he has imposed on me but he has not injured me </s>
<s>  i have never been
attached to him </s>
<s>  and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour </s>
<s>  he
never wished to attach me </s>
<s>  it was merely a blind to conceal his real
situation with another </s>
<s> it was his object to blind all about him </s>
<s>  and
no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myselfexcept
that i was not blindedthat it was my good fortunethat in short i
was somehow or other safe from him </s>
<s> 

she had hoped for an answer herefor a few words to say that her
conduct was at least intelligible </s>
<s>  but he was silent </s>
<s>  and as far as she
could judge deep in thought </s>
<s>  at last and tolerably in his usual tone
he said

i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill </s>
<s> i can suppose
however that i may have underrated him </s>
<s>  my acquaintance with him has
been but trifling </s>
<s> and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he
may yet turn out well </s>
<s> with such a woman he has a chance </s>
<s> i have no
motive for wishing him illand for her sake whose happiness will be
involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him
well </s>
<s> 

i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma </s>
<s>  i believe
them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached </s>

<s> 

emma could say no more </s>
<s>  they seemed to be within half a sentence
of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if
possible </s>
<s>  she made her plan </s>
<s>  she would speak of something totally

<s> 
absolutely silent </s>

emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment </s>
<s>  the
dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most
prominent feeling </s>
<s> 

i cannot make speeches emma </s>

<s>  and in a tone of
such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably
convincing </s>
<s> if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it
more </s>

while he spoke emmas mind was most busy and with all the wonderful
velocity of thought had been ableand yet without losing a wordto
catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole </s>
<s>  to see that harriets
hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a
delusion as any of her ownthat harriet was nothing </s>
<s>  that she was every

<s>  that what she had been saying relative to harriet
had been all taken as the language of her own feelings </s>
<s>  and that her
agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all
received as discouragement from herself </s>
<s> and not only was there time
for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness </s>
<s>  there
was time also to rejoice that harriets secret had not escaped her and

<s> it was all the service
she could now render her poor friend </s>
<s>  for as to any of that heroism of
sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his
affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the

with contrition </s>
<s>  but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that
could be probable or reasonable entered her brain </s>
<s>  she had led her
friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever </s>
<s>  but her
judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever
been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal
and degrading </s>
<s>  her way was clear though not quite smooth </s>
<s> she spoke
then on being so entreated </s>
<s> what did she say </s>

of course </s>
<s>  a lady always does </s>
<s> she said enough to shew there need not

<s>  he had despaired at
one period </s>
<s>  he had received such an injunction to caution and silence

<s> she had begun by refusing to hear
him </s>
<s> the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden </s>
<s> her proposal of
taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had
just put an end to might be a little extraordinary </s>

inconsistency </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley was so obliging as to put up with it

<s>

little mistaken </s>
<s>  but where as in this case though the conduct is
mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material </s>

knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she
possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his </s>
<s> 

he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence </s>

followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it </s>
<s>  he had come
in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchills engagement with no
selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an
opening to soothe or to counsel her </s>
<s> the rest had been the work of
the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings </s>

delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill

eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his
attempt to attach her </s>

chapter xiv


what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from
what she had brought out </s>
<s> she had then been only daring to hope for
a little respite of suffering </s>
<s> she was now in an exquisite flutter of
happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be
greater when the flutter should have passed away </s>
<s> 

they sat down to teathe same party round the same tablehow often
it had been collected </s>
<s> and how often had her eyes fallen on the same
shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the
western sun </s>
<s> but never in such a state of spirits never in any thing
like it </s>
<s>  and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her
usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive
daughter </s>
<s> 

poor <abvr> woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the
breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously
hoping might not have taken cold from his ride </s>
<s> could he have seen the
heart he would have cared very little for the lungs </s>
<s>  but without the
most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest
perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either
he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had
received from <abvr> perry and talked on with much selfcontentment
totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return </s>
<s> 

as long as <abvr> knightley remained with them emmas fever continued </s>
<s> 
but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and
subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax
for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points
to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some
alloy </s>
<s>  her fatherand harriet </s>
<s>  she could not be alone without feeling
the full weight of their separate claims </s>
<s>  and how to guard the comfort
of both to the utmost was the question </s>
<s>  with respect to her father
it was a question soon answered </s>
<s>  she hardly knew yet what <abvr> knightley
would ask </s>
<s>  but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most
solemn resolution of never quitting her father </s>
<s> she even wept over
the idea of it as a sin of thought </s>
<s>  while he lived it must be only an
engagement </s>
<s>  but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of
drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him </s>
<s> how
to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision </s>
<s> how to spare
her from any unnecessary pain </s>
<s>  how to make her any possible atonement </s>
<s> 
how to appear least her enemy </s>
<s> on these subjects her perplexity
and distress were very greatand her mind had to pass again and
again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever
surrounded it </s>
<s> she could only resolve at last that she would still
avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by
letter </s>
<s>  that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed
just now for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme
morenearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her to brunswick square </s>
<s> isabella had been pleased with harriet </s>
<s> 
and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement </s>

not think it in harriets nature to escape being benefited by novelty

<s> at any rate
it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom
every thing was due </s>
<s>  a separation for the present </s>
<s>  an averting of the
evil day when they must all be together again </s>
<s> 

she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet </s>
<s>  an employment which
left her so very serious so nearly sad that <abvr> knightley in walking
up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon </s>

an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him

if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be
expected </s>
<s>  but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and
indulgence </s>
<s> you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of
even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct </s>
<s> but
i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent </s>
<s>  my courage
rises while i write </s>
<s>  it is very difficult for the prosperous to be
humble </s>
<s>  i have already met with such success in two applications for
pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours
and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence </s>
<s> you
must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i
first arrived at randalls </s>
<s>  you must consider me as having a secret which
was to be kept at all hazards </s>
<s>  this was the fact </s>
<s>  my right to place
myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question </s>
<s> 
i shall not discuss it here </s>
<s>  for my temptation to think it a right
i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and
casements above in highbury </s>
<s>  i dared not address her openly </s>
<s>  my
difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to
require definition </s>
<s>  and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we
parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the
creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement </s>
<s> had she refused i
should have gone mad </s>
<s> but you will be ready to say what was your
hope in doing this </s>
<s> what did you look forward to </s>
<s> to any thing every
thingto time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts
perseverance and weariness health and sickness </s>
<s>  every possibility of
good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her
promises of faith and correspondence </s>
<s>  if you need farther explanation
i have the honour my dear madam of being your husbands son and
the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no
inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of </s>
<s> see
me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to
randalls </s>
<s> and here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have
been sooner paid </s>
<s>  you will look back and see that i did not come till
miss fairfax was in highbury </s>
<s>  and as you were the person slighted you
will forgive me instantly </s>
<s>  but i must work on my fathers compassion by
reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long
i lost the blessing of knowing you </s>
<s>  my behaviour during the very
happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to
reprehension excepting on one point </s>
<s>  and now i come to the principal
the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which
excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation </s>
<s>  with
the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss
woodhouse </s>
<s>  my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest
humiliation </s>
<s> a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his
opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to </s>
<s> my behaviour
to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought </s>
<s> in order to
assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than
an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately
thrown </s>
<s> i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible objectbut
i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been
convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any
selfish views to go on </s>
<s> amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is
she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached </s>
<s>  and
that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me
was as much my conviction as my wish </s>
<s> she received my attentions with
an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me </s>
<s> 
we seemed to understand each other </s>
<s>  from our relative situation those
attentions were her due and were felt to be so </s>
<s> whether miss woodhouse
began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight
i cannot say </s>
<s> when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was
within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not
without suspicion </s>
<s>  but i have no doubt of her having since detected me
at least in some degree </s>
<s> she may not have surmised the whole but her
quickness must have penetrated a part </s>
<s>  i cannot doubt it </s>
<s>  you will find
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it
did not take her wholly by surprize </s>
<s>  she frequently gave me hints of it </s>
<s> 
i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed <abvr> elton gratitude
for her attentions to miss fairfax </s>
<s> i hope this history of my conduct
towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation
of what you saw amiss </s>
<s>  while you considered me as having sinned against
emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either </s>
<s>  acquit me here and
procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes
of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly
affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as
myself </s>
<s> whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight
you have now a key to </s>
<s>  my heart was in highbury and my business was to
get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion </s>
<s> 
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account </s>
<s> of
the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that
its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never
have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her </s>
<s> the
delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam
is much beyond my power of doing justice to </s>
<s>  you will soon i earnestly
hope know her thoroughly yourself </s>
<s> no description can describe her </s>
<s> 
she must tell you herself what she isyet not by word for never
was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own
merit </s>
<s> since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw
i have heard from her </s>
<s> she gives a good account of her own health </s>
<s>  but
as she never complains i dare not depend </s>
<s>  i want to have your opinion
of her looks </s>
<s>  i know you will soon call on her </s>
<s>  she is living in dread
of the visit </s>
<s>  perhaps it is paid already </s>
<s>  let me hear from you without
delay </s>
<s>  i am impatient for a thousand particulars </s>
<s>  remember how few
minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state </s>
<s>  and
i am not much better yet </s>
<s>  still insane either from happiness or
misery </s>
<s>  when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her
excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad with joy </s>
<s> 
but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little
i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger </s>
<s>  if i could but see her
again </s>
<s> but i must not propose it yet </s>
<s>  my uncle has been too good for me
to encroach </s>
<s> i must still add to this long letter </s>
<s>  you have not heard
all that you ought to hear </s>
<s>  i could not give any connected detail
yesterday </s>
<s>  but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness
with which the affair burst out needs explanation </s>
<s>  for though the event
of the th ult </s>
<s>  as you will conclude immediately opened to me the
happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures
but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to
lose </s>
<s>  i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she
would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and
refinement </s>
<s> but i had no choice </s>
<s>  the hasty engagement she had entered
into with that womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off
abruptly to recollect and compose myself </s>
<s> i have been walking over
the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of
my letter what it ought to be </s>
<s> it is in fact a most mortifying
retrospect for me </s>
<s>  i behaved shamefully </s>
<s>  and here i can admit that
my manners to miss w </s>
<s>  in being unpleasant to miss f </s>
<s>  were highly
blameable </s>
<s>  she disapproved them which ought to have been enough </s>
<s> my
plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient </s>
<s> she was
displeased </s>
<s>  i thought unreasonably so </s>
<s>  i thought her on a thousand
occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious </s>
<s>  i thought her even
cold </s>
<s>  but she was always right </s>
<s>  if i had followed her judgment and
subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known </s>
<s> we quarrelled </s>
<s> 
do you remember the morning spent at donwell </s>
<s> there every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis </s>
<s>  i was late </s>
<s> 
i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she
would not suffer it </s>
<s>  she absolutely refused to allow me which i then
thought most unreasonable </s>
<s>  now however i see nothing in it but a very
natural and consistent degree of discretion </s>
<s>  while i to blind the
world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable
particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a
proposal which might have made every previous caution useless </s>
<s> had we
been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must
have been suspected </s>
<s> i was mad enough however to resent </s>
<s> i doubted
her affection </s>
<s>  i doubted it more the next day on box hill </s>
<s>  when
provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect
of her and such apparent devotion to miss w </s>
<s>  as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in
a form of words perfectly intelligible to me </s>
<s> in short my dear
madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine </s>
<s>  and
i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with
you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with
her as possible </s>
<s>  even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to
be reconciled in time </s>
<s>  but i was the injured person injured by her
coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first
advances </s>
<s> i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of
the box hill party </s>
<s>  had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly
suppose you would ever have thought well of me again </s>
<s>  its effect upon
her appears in the immediate resolution it produced </s>
<s>  as soon as she
found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that
officious <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  the whole system of whose treatment of her by the
bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred </s>
<s>  i must not quarrel
with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards
myself </s>
<s>  but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it
which that woman has known </s>
<s> òjane indeed </s>
<s> you will observe that i
have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you </s>
<s> 
think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between
the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the
insolence of imaginary superiority </s>
<s>  have patience with me i shall soon
have done </s>
<s> she closed with this offer resolving to break with me
entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet
again </s>
<s> she felt the engagement to be a source of
repentance and misery to each </s>
<s>  she dissolved it </s>
<s> this
letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunts death </s>
<s>  i
answered it within an hour </s>
<s>  but from the confusion of my mind and the
multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of
being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in
my writingdesk </s>
<s>  and i trusting that i had written enough though but
a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness </s>
<s> i was
rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily </s>
<s>  but i
made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i add </s>
<s> too cheerful
in my views to be captious </s>
<s> we removed to windsor </s>
<s>  and two
days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all
returned </s>
<s> and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her
extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last </s>
<s>  and
adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued
and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate
arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe
conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly
command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would
forward them after that period to her at </s>
<s>  in short the full direction
to <abvr> smallridges near bristol stared me in the face </s>
<s>  i knew the
name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had
been doing </s>
<s>  it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which i knew her to possess </s>
<s>  and the secrecy she had maintained as to
any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its
anxious delicacy </s>
<s>  for the world would not she have seemed to threaten
me </s>
<s> imagine the shock </s>
<s>  imagine how till i had actually detected my
own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post </s>
<s> what was to be
done </s>
<s> one thing only </s>
<s> i must speak to my uncle </s>
<s>  without his sanction i
could not hope to be listened to again </s>
<s> i spoke </s>
<s>  circumstances were
in my favour </s>
<s>  the late event had softened away his pride and he was
earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying </s>
<s> 
and could say at last poor man </s>
<s>  with a deep sigh that he wished i
might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done </s>
<s> i
felt that it would be of a different sort </s>
<s> are you disposed to pity
me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my
suspense while all was at stake </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  do not pity me till i reached
highbury and saw how ill i had made her </s>
<s>  do not pity me till i saw her
wan sick looks </s>
<s> i reached highbury at the time of day when from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance
of finding her alone </s>
<s> i was not disappointed </s>
<s>  and at last i was not
disappointed either in the object of my journey </s>
<s>  a great deal of very
reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away </s>
<s>  but it is
done </s>
<s>  we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moments
uneasiness can ever occur between us again </s>
<s>  now my dear madam i will
release you </s>
<s>  but i could not conclude before </s>
<s>  a thousand and a thousand
thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for
the attentions your heart will dictate towards her </s>
<s> if you think me in
a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinion </s>

w </s>
<s>  calls me the child of good fortune </s>

<s> in one
respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe
myself

chapter xv


this letter must make its way to emmas feelings </s>
<s>  she was obliged in
spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the
justice that <abvr> weston foretold </s>
<s>  as soon as she came to her own name
it was irresistible </s>
<s>  every line relating to herself was interesting
and almost every line agreeable </s>
<s>  and when this charm ceased the subject
could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard
for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of
love must have for her at that moment </s>
<s>  she never stopt till she had gone
through the whole </s>
<s>  and though it was impossible not to feel that he had
been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had
suffered and was very sorryand he was so grateful to <abvr> weston and
so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that
there was no being severe </s>
<s>  and could he have entered the room she must
have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever </s>
<s> 

she thought so well of the letter that when <abvr> knightley came again
she desired him to read it </s>
<s>  she was sure of <abvr> westons wishing it to
be communicated </s>
<s>  especially to one who like <abvr> knightley had seen so
much to blame in his conduct </s>
<s> 

i shall be very glad to look it over said he </s>
<s>  but it seems long </s>
<s>  i
will take it home with me at night </s>
<s> 

but that would not do </s>
<s>  <abvr> weston was to call in the evening and she
must return it by him </s>
<s> 

i would rather be talking to you he replied </s>
<s>  but as it seems a
matter of justice it shall be done </s>
<s> 

he beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered
the sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few
months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference </s>
<s> 

he proceeded a little farther reading to himself </s>
<s>  and then with a
smile observed humph </s>
<s>  a fine complimentary opening </s>
<s>  but it is his
way </s>
<s>  one mans style must not be the rule of anothers </s>
<s>  we will not be
severe </s>
<s> 

it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my
opinion aloud as i read </s>
<s>  by doing it i shall feel that i am near you </s>
<s> 
it will not be so great a loss of time </s>
<s>  but if you dislike it

not at all </s>
<s>  i should wish it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity </s>
<s> 

he trifles here said he as to the temptation </s>
<s>  he knows he is wrong
and has nothing rational to urge </s>
<s> bad </s>
<s> he ought not to have formed the
engagement </s>
<s> òhis fathers disposition </s>
<s> he is unjust however to his
father </s>
<s>  <abvr> westons sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright
and honourable exertions </s>
<s>  but <abvr> weston earned every present comfort
before he endeavoured to gain it </s>
<s> very true </s>
<s>  he did not come till miss
fairfax was here </s>
<s> 

and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might
have come sooner if he would </s>
<s>  you pass it over very handsomelybut you
were perfectly right </s>
<s> 

i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma </s>
<s> but yet i thinkhad
you not been in the casei should still have distrusted him </s>
<s> 

when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it
aloudall that related to her with a smile </s>
<s>  a look </s>
<s>  a shake of the
head </s>
<s>  a word or two of assent or disapprobation </s>
<s>  or merely of love as
the subject required </s>
<s>  concluding however seriously and after steady
reflection thus

very badthough it might have been worse </s>
<s> playing a most dangerous
game </s>
<s>  too much indebted to the event for his acquittal </s>
<s> no judge of
his own manners by you </s>
<s> always deceived in fact by his own wishes and
regardless of little besides his own convenience </s>
<s> fancying you to have
fathomed his secret </s>
<s>  natural enough </s>
<s> his own mind full of intrigue
that he should suspect it in others </s>
<s> mystery </s>
<s>  finessehow they pervert
the understanding </s>
<s>  my emma does not every thing serve to prove more
and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each
other </s>
<s> 

emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriets account
which she could not give any sincere explanation of </s>
<s> 

you had better go on said she </s>
<s> 

he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  that
was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether
the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure </s>
<s>  a
boyish scheme indeed </s>
<s> i cannot comprehend a mans wishing to give a
woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense
with </s>
<s>  and he did know that she would have prevented the instruments
coming if she could </s>
<s> 

after this he made some progress without any pause </s>
<s>  frank churchills
confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for
more than a word in passing </s>
<s> 

i perfectly agree with you sirwas then his remark </s>
<s>  you did behave
very shamefully </s>
<s>  you never wrote a truer line </s>
<s>  and having gone through
what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his
persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxs sense of right
he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad </s>
<s> he had induced her
to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and
uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from
suffering unnecessarily </s>
<s> she must have had much more to contend
with in carrying on the correspondence than he could </s>
<s>  he should have
respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such </s>
<s>  but hers were
all reasonable </s>
<s>  we must look to her one fault and remember that she
had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she
should have been in such a state of punishment </s>
<s> 

emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew
uncomfortable </s>
<s>  her own behaviour had been so very improper </s>
<s>  she was
deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look </s>
<s>  it was all read
however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark </s>
<s>  and
excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear
of giving painno remembrance of box hill seemed to exist </s>
<s> 

there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the
eltons was his next observation </s>
<s> his feelings are natural </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> 
actually resolve to break with him entirely </s>
<s> she felt the engagement to
be a source of repentance and misery to eachshe dissolved it </s>
<s> what a
view this gives of her sense of his behaviour </s>
<s> well he must be a most
extraordinary

nay nay read on </s>
<s> you will find how very much he suffers </s>
<s> 

i hope he does replied <abvr> knightley coolly and resuming the letter </s>
<s> 
òsmallridge </s>
<s> what does this mean </s>
<s>  what is all this </s>
<s> 

she had engaged to go as governess to <abvr> smallridges childrena
dear friend of <abvr> eltonsa neighbour of maple grove </s>
<s>  and by the
bye i wonder how <abvr> elton bears the disappointment </s>
<s> 

say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to readnot even of
mrs </s>
<s>  elton </s>
<s>  only one page more </s>
<s>  i shall soon have done </s>
<s>  what a letter
the man writes </s>
<s> 

i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him </s>
<s> 

well there is feeling here </s>
<s> he does seem to have suffered in
finding her ill </s>
<s> certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of
her </s>
<s>  òdearer much dearer than ever </s>
<s>  i hope he may long continue to
feel all the value of such a reconciliation </s>
<s> he is a very liberal
thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands </s>
<s> òhappier than i
deserve </s>
<s>  come he knows himself there </s>
<s>  òmiss woodhouse calls me the
child of good fortune </s>
<s> those were miss woodhouses words were they </s>
<s> 
and a fine endingand there is the letter </s>
<s>  the child of good fortune </s>
<s> 
that was your name for him was it </s>
<s> 

you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am </s>
<s>  but still
you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it </s>
<s>  i
hope it does him some service with you </s>
<s> 

yes certainly it does </s>
<s>  he has had great faults faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness </s>
<s>  and i am very much of his opinion
in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves </s>
<s>  but still as he
is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it
may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very
ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the
steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants </s>
<s>  and now let me talk
to you of something else </s>
<s>  i have another persons interest at present
so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill </s>
<s> 
ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work
on one subject </s>
<s> 

the subject followed </s>
<s>  it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike
english such as <abvr> knightley used even to the woman he was in love
with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the
happiness of her father </s>
<s>  emmas answer was ready at the first word </s>
<s> 
while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible
for her </s>
<s>  she could never quit him </s>
<s>  part only of this answer however
was admitted </s>
<s>  the impossibility of her quitting her father <abvr>
knightley felt as strongly as herself </s>
<s>  but the inadmissibility of any
other change he could not agree to </s>
<s>  he had been thinking it over most
deeply most intently </s>
<s>  he had at first hoped to induce <abvr> woodhouse to
remove with her to donwell </s>
<s>  he had wanted to believe it feasible but
his knowledge of <abvr> woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself
long </s>
<s>  and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation
would be a risk of her fathers comfort perhaps even of his life which
must not be hazarded </s>
<s>  <abvr> woodhouse taken from hartfield </s>
<s> no he felt
that it ought not to be attempted </s>
<s>  but the plan which had arisen on the
sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any
respect objectionable </s>
<s>  it was that he should be received at hartfield </s>
<s> 
that so long as her fathers happinessin other words his liferequired
hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise </s>
<s> 

of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing
thoughts </s>
<s>  like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it </s>
<s>  but such
an alternative as this had not occurred to her </s>
<s>  she was sensible of all
the affection it evinced </s>
<s>  she felt that in quitting donwell he must
be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits </s>
<s>  that
in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there
would be much very much to be borne with </s>
<s>  she promised to think of it
and advised him to think of it more </s>
<s>  but he was fully convinced that no
reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject </s>
<s>  he had
given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration </s>
<s>  he had
been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his
thoughts to himself </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma </s>
<s>  i am sure
william larkins will not like it </s>
<s>  you must get his consent before you
ask mine </s>
<s> 

she promised however to think of it </s>
<s>  and pretty nearly promised
moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good
scheme </s>
<s> 

it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in
which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as
heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded </s>
<s>  think she must
of the possible difference to the poor little boy </s>
<s>  and yet she only
gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in
detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of <abvr> knightleys
marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had
wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt </s>
<s> 

this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at
hartfieldthe more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became </s>
<s> 
his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual
good to outweigh every drawback </s>
<s>  such a companion for herself in the
periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her </s>
<s> such a partner in
all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of
melancholy </s>
<s> 

she would have been too happy but for poor harriet </s>
<s>  but every blessing
of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend
who must now be even excluded from hartfield </s>
<s>  the delightful family
party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere
charitable caution be kept at a distance from </s>
<s>  she would be a loser in
every way </s>
<s>  emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction
from her own enjoyment </s>
<s>  in such a party harriet would be rather a
dead weight than otherwise </s>
<s>  but for the poor girl herself it seemed a
peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of
unmerited punishment </s>
<s> 

in time of course <abvr> knightley would be forgotten that is
supplanted </s>
<s>  but this could not be expected to happen very early </s>
<s>  <abvr>
knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure </s>
<s> not
like <abvr> elton </s>
<s>  <abvr> knightley always so kind so feeling so truly
considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped
than now </s>
<s>  and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she
could be in love with more than three men in one year </s>
<s> 



chapter xvi


it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as
herself to avoid a meeting </s>
<s>  their intercourse was painful enough by
letter </s>
<s>  how much worse had they been obliged to meet </s>
<s> 

harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without
reproaches or apparent sense of illusage </s>
<s>  and yet emma fancied there
was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style
which increased the desirableness of their being separate </s>
<s> it might be
only her own consciousness </s>
<s>  but it seemed as if an angel only could have
been quite without resentment under such a stroke </s>
<s> 

she had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation </s>
<s>  and she was
fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting
to invention </s>
<s> there was a tooth amiss </s>
<s>  harriet really wished and
had wished some time to consult a dentist </s>
<s>  <abvr> john knightley was
delighted to be of use </s>
<s>  any thing of ill health was a recommendation to
herand though not so fond of a dentist as of a <abvr> wingfield she was
quite eager to have harriet under her care </s>
<s> when it was thus settled
on her sisters side emma proposed it to her friend and found her
very persuadable </s>
<s> harriet was to go </s>
<s>  she was invited for at least a
fortnight </s>
<s>  she was to be conveyed in <abvr> woodhouses carriage </s>
<s> it was
all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick
square </s>
<s> 

now emma could indeed enjoy <abvr> knightleys visits </s>
<s>  now she could
talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense
of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her
when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might
at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings
which she had led astray herself </s>
<s> 

the difference of harriet at <abvr> goddards or in london made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in emmas sensations </s>
<s>  but she could not think
of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must
be averting the past and carrying her out of herself </s>
<s> 

she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which harriet had occupied </s>
<s>  there was a communication before
her one which she only could be competent to makethe confession of
her engagement to her father </s>
<s>  but she would have nothing to do with it
at present </s>
<s> she had resolved to defer the disclosure till <abvr> weston
were safe and well </s>
<s>  no additional agitation should be thrown at this
period among those she lovedand the evil should not act on herself
by anticipation before the appointed time </s>
<s> a fortnight at least of
leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating
delight should be hers </s>
<s> 

she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an
hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax </s>
<s> she ought
to goand she was longing to see her </s>
<s>  the resemblance of their present
situations increasing every other motive of goodwill </s>
<s>  it would be a
secret satisfaction </s>
<s>  but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect
would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any
thing jane might communicate </s>
<s> 

she wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not
been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had
been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the
worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected </s>
<s> the fear of being still
unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to
wait in the passage and send up her name </s>
<s> she heard patty announcing
it </s>
<s>  but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so
happily intelligible </s>
<s> no </s>
<s>  she heard nothing but the instant reply of
beg her to walk up </s>
<s> and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs
by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her
were felt sufficient </s>
<s> emma had never seen her look so well so lovely
so engaging </s>
<s>  there was consciousness animation and warmth </s>
<s>  there was
every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted </s>
<s> 
she came forward with an offered hand </s>
<s>  and said in a low but very
feeling tone

this is most kind indeed </s>
<s> miss woodhouse it is impossible for me
to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being so entirely
without words </s>
<s> 

emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the
sound of <abvr> eltons voice from the sittingroom had not checked
her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her
congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  bates and <abvr> elton were together </s>
<s>  miss bates was out which
accounted for the previous tranquillity </s>
<s>  emma could have wished <abvr>
elton elsewhere </s>
<s>  but she was in a humour to have patience with every
body </s>
<s>  and as <abvr> elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the
rencontre would do them no harm </s>
<s> 

she soon believed herself to penetrate <abvr> eltons thoughts and
understand why she was like herself in happy spirits </s>
<s>  it was being in
miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was
still a secret to other people </s>
<s>  emma saw symptoms of it immediately in
the expression of her face </s>
<s>  and while paying her own compliments to <abvr>
bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladys replies she saw
her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she
had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into
the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods

we can finish this some other time you know </s>
<s>  you and i shall not want
opportunities </s>
<s>  and in fact you have heard all the essential already </s>
<s>  i
only wanted to prove to you that <abvr> s </s>
<s>  admits our apology and is
not offended </s>
<s>  you see how delightfully she writes </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she is a sweet
creature </s>
<s>  you would have doated on her had you gone </s>
<s> but not a word
more </s>
<s>  let us be discreetquite on our good behaviour </s>
<s> hush </s>
<s> you
remember those linesi forget the poem at this moment </s>
<s> 

        for when a ladys in the case
        you know all other things give place </s>
<s> 

now i say my dear in our case for lady readmum </s>
<s>  a word to
the wise </s>
<s> i am in a fine flow of spirits ant i </s>
<s>  but i want to set
your heart at ease as to <abvr> s </s>
<s> my representation you see has
quite appeased her </s>
<s> 

and again on emmas merely turning her head to look at <abvr> batess
knitting she added in a half whisper

i mentioned no names you will observe </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  cautious as a
minister of state </s>
<s>  i managed it extremely well </s>
<s> 

emma could not doubt </s>
<s>  it was a palpable display repeated on every
possible occasion </s>
<s>  when they had all talked a little while in harmony of
the weather and <abvr> weston she found herself abruptly addressed with

do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered </s>
<s> do not you think her cure does perry the highest
credit </s>
<s> here was a sideglance of great meaning at jane </s>
<s>  upon my
word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  if you had
seen her as i did when she was at the worst </s>
<s> and when <abvr> bates
was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word
of any assistance that perry might have </s>
<s>  not a word of a certain young
physician from windsor </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  perry shall have all the credit </s>
<s> 

i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she
shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill </s>
<s>  very pleasant
party </s>
<s>  but yet i think there was something wanting </s>
<s>  things did not
seemthat is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some </s>
<s> so
it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken </s>
<s>  however i think
it answered so far as to tempt one to go again </s>
<s>  what say you both to our
collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the
fine weather lasts </s>
<s> it must be the same party you know quite the
same party not one exception </s>
<s> 

soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being
diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting
she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say
every thing </s>
<s> 

thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness </s>
<s> it is impossible
to sayyes indeed i quite understanddearest janes prospectsthat
is i do not mean </s>
<s> but she is charmingly recovered </s>
<s> how is <abvr>
woodhouse </s>
<s> i am so glad </s>
<s> quite out of my power </s>
<s> such a happy little
circle as you find us here </s>
<s> yes indeed </s>
<s> charming young man </s>
<s> that
isso very friendly </s>
<s>  i mean good <abvr> perry </s>
<s> such attention to
jane </s>
<s> and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight
towards <abvr> elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a
little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter
which was now graciously overcome </s>
<s> after a few whispers indeed which
placed it beyond a guess <abvr> elton speaking louder said

yes here i am my good friend </s>
<s>  and here i have been so long that
anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise </s>
<s>  but the truth
is that i am waiting for my lord and master </s>
<s>  he promised to join me
here and pay his respects to you </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  are we to have the pleasure of a call from <abvr> elton </s>
<s> that will
be a favour indeed </s>
<s>  for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and
mr </s>
<s>  eltons time is so engaged </s>
<s> 

upon my word it is miss bates </s>
<s> he really is engaged from morning to
night </s>
<s> there is no end of peoples coming to him on some pretence or
other </s>
<s> the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always
wanting his opinion </s>
<s>  they seem not able to do any thing without
him </s>
<s> òupon my word <abvr> e </s>
<s>  i often say òrather you than i </s>
<s> i do
not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had
half so many applicants </s>
<s> bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect
them both to an unpardonable degree </s>
<s> i believe i have not played a bar
this fortnight </s>
<s> however he is coming i assure you </s>
<s>  yes indeed on
purpose to wait on you all </s>
<s>  and putting up her hand to screen her
words from emmaa congratulatory visit you know </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s>  yes quite
indispensable </s>
<s> 

miss bates looked about her so happily </s>
<s> 

he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from knightley </s>
<s>  but he and knightley are shut up together in deep
consultation </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  e </s>
<s>  is knightleys right hand </s>
<s> 

emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is <abvr> elton
gone on foot to donwell </s>
<s> he will have a hot walk </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting </s>
<s>  weston and
cole will be there too </s>
<s>  but one is apt to speak only of those who
lead </s>
<s> i fancy <abvr> e </s>
<s>  and knightley have every thing their own way </s>
<s> 

have not you mistaken the day </s>
<s>  said emma </s>
<s>  i am almost certain that
the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrow </s>
<s> mr </s>
<s>  knightley was at
hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer which
denoted the impossibility of any blunder on <abvr> eltons side </s>
<s> i do
believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever
was </s>
<s>  we never heard of such things at maple grove </s>
<s> 

your parish there was small said jane </s>
<s> 

upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject
talked of </s>
<s> 

but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard
you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and <abvr> bragge </s>
<s>  the
only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  you clever creature thats very true </s>
<s>  what a thinking brain you
have </s>
<s>  i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we
could be shaken together </s>
<s>  my liveliness and your solidity would produce
perfection </s>
<s> not that i presume to insinuate however that some
people may not think you perfection already </s>
<s> but hush </s>
<s> not a word
if you please </s>
<s> 

it seemed an unnecessary caution </s>
<s>  jane was wanting to give her words
not to <abvr> elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw </s>
<s> 
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very
evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton made his appearance </s>
<s>  his lady greeted him with some of her
sparkling vivacity </s>
<s> 

very pretty sir upon my word </s>
<s>  to send me on here to be an
encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come </s>
<s> but
you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with </s>
<s>  you knew i should
not stir till my lord and master appeared </s>
<s> here have i been sitting
this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal
obediencefor who can say you know how soon it may be wanted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away </s>
<s> 
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid </s>
<s>  but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the
walk he had had for nothing </s>
<s> 

when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found </s>
<s>  very
odd </s>
<s>  very unaccountable </s>
<s>  after the note i sent him this morning and the
message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one </s>
<s> 

donwell </s>
<s>  cried his wife </s>
<s> my dear <abvr> e </s>
<s>  you have not been to
donwell </s>
<s> you mean the crown </s>
<s>  you come from the meeting at the crown </s>
<s> 

no no thats tomorrow </s>
<s>  and i particularly wanted to see knightley
today on that very account </s>
<s> such a dreadful broiling morning </s>
<s> i went
over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage which made
it so much the worse </s>
<s>  and then not to find him at home </s>
<s>  i assure you
i am not at all pleased </s>
<s>  and no apology left no message for me </s>
<s>  the
housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected </s>
<s> very
extraordinary </s>
<s> and nobody knew at all which way he was gone </s>
<s>  perhaps
to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods </s>
<s> miss
woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley </s>
<s> can you explain it </s>
<s> 

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary
indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him </s>
<s> 

i cannot imagine said <abvr> elton feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of
all people in the world </s>
<s>  the very last person whom one should expect to
be forgotten </s>
<s> my dear <abvr> e </s>
<s>  he must have left a message for you i am
sure he must </s>
<s> not even knightley could be so very eccentric </s>
<s> and his
servants forgot it </s>
<s>  depend upon it that was the case </s>
<s>  and very likely
to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed
extremely awkward and remiss </s>
<s> i am sure i would not have such a
creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration </s>
<s>  and
as for <abvr> hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed </s>
<s> she promised
wright a receipt and never sent it </s>
<s> 

i met william larkins continued <abvr> elton as i got near the house
and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not
believe him </s>
<s> william seemed rather out of humour </s>
<s>  he did not know what
was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the
speech of him </s>
<s>  i have nothing to do with williams wants but it really
is of very great importance that i should see knightley today </s>
<s>  and it
becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should
have had this hot walk to no purpose </s>
<s> 

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly </s>
<s>  in
all probability she was at this very time waited for there </s>
<s>  and <abvr>
knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards
mr </s>
<s>  elton if not towards william larkins </s>
<s> 

she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to
attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs </s>
<s>  it gave her
an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say

it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility </s>
<s>  had you
not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to
introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might
have been strictly correct </s>
<s> i feel that i should certainly have been
impertinent </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual
composurethere would have been no danger </s>
<s>  the danger would have
been of my wearying you </s>
<s>  you could not have gratified me more than
by expressing an interest </s>
<s>  indeed miss woodhouse speaking more
collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very
great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those
of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not
disgusted to such a degree as toi have not time for half that i could
wish to say </s>
<s>  i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for
myself </s>
<s>  i feel it so very due </s>
<s>  but unfortunatelyin short if your
compassion does not stand my friend

oh </s>
<s>  you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and
taking her hand </s>
<s>  you owe me no apologies </s>
<s>  and every body to whom you
might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted
even

you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you </s>
<s> so
cold and artificial </s>
<s> i had always a part to act </s>
<s> it was a life of
deceit </s>
<s> i know that i must have disgusted you </s>
<s> 

pray say no more </s>
<s>  i feel that all the apologies should be on my side </s>
<s> 
let us forgive each other at once </s>
<s>  we must do whatever is to be done
quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there </s>
<s>  i hope you
have pleasant accounts from windsor </s>
<s> 

very </s>
<s> 

and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose youjust as
i begin to know you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet </s>
<s>  i am here
till claimed by colonel and <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 

nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma
smilingbut excuse me it must be thought of </s>
<s> 

the smile was returned as jane answered

you are very right </s>
<s>  it has been thought of </s>
<s>  and i will own to you i
am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with <abvr> churchill
at enscombe it is settled </s>
<s>  there must be three months at least of
deep mourning </s>
<s>  but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing
more to wait for </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you </s>
<s> this is just what i wanted to be assured
of </s>
<s> oh </s>

chapter xvii


mrs </s>
<s>  westons friends were all made happy by her safety </s>
<s>  and if the
satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to emma it was by
knowing her to be the mother of a little girl </s>
<s>  she had been decided in
wishing for a miss weston </s>
<s>  she would not acknowledge that it was with
any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabellas
sons </s>
<s>  but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father
and mother best </s>
<s>  it would be a great comfort to <abvr> weston as he grew
olderand even <abvr> weston might be growing older ten years henceto
have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home </s>
<s>  and <abvr> westonno
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her </s>
<s>  and it would be
quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have
their powers in exercise again </s>
<s> 

she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she
continuedlike la baronne dalmane on la comtesse dostalis in madame
de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little
adelaide educated on a more perfect plan </s>
<s> 

that is replied <abvr> knightley she will indulge her even more than
she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all </s>
<s>  it will
be the only difference </s>
<s> 

poor child </s>
<s>  cried emma </s>
<s>  at that rate what will become of her </s>
<s> 

nothing very bad </s>
<s> the fate of thousands </s>
<s>  she will be disagreeable
in infancy and correct herself as she grows older </s>
<s>  i am losing all my
bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma </s>
<s>  i who am owing all
my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be
severe on them </s>
<s> 

emma laughed and replied </s>
<s>  but i had the assistance of all your
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people </s>
<s>  i doubt whether
my own sense would have corrected me without it </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s> i have no doubt </s>
<s>  nature gave you understanding </s>
<s> miss taylor
gave you principles </s>
<s>  you must have done well </s>
<s>  my interference was quite
as likely to do harm as good </s>
<s>  it was very natural for you to say what
right has he to lecture me </s>
<s> and i am afraid very natural for you to
feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner </s>
<s>  i do not believe i did
you any good </s>
<s>  the good was all to myself by making you an object of the
tenderest affection to me </s>
<s>  i could not think about you so much without
doating on you faults and all </s>
<s>  and by dint of fancying so many errors
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least </s>
<s> 

i am sure you were of use to me cried emma </s>
<s>  i was very often
influenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time </s>
<s>  i
am very sure you did me good </s>
<s>  and if poor little anna weston is to be
spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her
as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is
thirteen </s>
<s> 

how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your
saucy looksòmr </s>
<s>  knightley i am going to do soandso </s>
<s>  papa says i
may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which you knew i
did not approve </s>
<s>  in such cases my interference was giving you two bad
feelings instead of one </s>
<s> 

what an amiable creature i was </s>
<s> no wonder you should hold my speeches
in such affectionate remembrance </s>
<s> 

òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s> you always called me òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  and from
habit it has not so very formal a sound </s>
<s> and yet it is formal </s>
<s>  i want
you to call me something else but i do not know what </s>
<s> 

i remember once calling you ògeorge in one of my amiable fits about
ten years ago </s>
<s>  i did it because i thought it would offend you </s>
<s>  but as
you made no objection i never did it again </s>
<s> 

and cannot you call me ògeorge now </s>
<s> 

impossible </s>
<s> i never can call you any thing but òmr </s>
<s>  knightley </s>
<s>  i
will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of <abvr> elton by

<s> 
i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where </s>
<s> in the building in
which n </s>
<s>  takes m </s>
<s>  for better for worse </s>
<s> 

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important
service which his better sense would have rendered her to the
advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly
folliesher wilful intimacy with harriet smith </s>
<s>  but it was too tender a
subject </s>
<s> she could not enter on it </s>
<s> harriet was very seldom mentioned
between them </s>
<s>  this on his side might merely proceed from her not being
thought of </s>
<s>  but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy
and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were
declining </s>
<s>  she was aware herself that parting under any other
circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that
her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on
isabellas letters </s>
<s>  he might observe that it was so </s>
<s>  the pain of being
obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to
the pain of having made harriet unhappy </s>
<s> 

isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be
expected </s>
<s>  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which
appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted </s>
<s>  but
since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet
different from what she had known her before </s>
<s> isabella to be sure
was no very quick observer </s>
<s>  yet if harriet had not been equal to playing
with the children it would not have escaped her </s>
<s>  emmas comforts and
hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriets being to stay longer </s>
<s> 
her fortnight was likely to be a month at least </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> john
knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain
till they could bring her back </s>
<s> 

john does not even mention your friend said <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  here is
his answer if you like to see it </s>
<s> 

it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage </s>
<s>  emma
accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know
what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her
friend was unmentioned </s>
<s> 

john enters like a brother into my happiness continued <abvr> knightley
but he is no complimenter </s>
<s>  and though i well know him to have
likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making
flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in
her praise </s>
<s>  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes </s>
<s> 

he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the
letter </s>
<s>  i honour his sincerity </s>
<s>  it is very plain that he considers the
good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not
without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as
you think me already </s>
<s>  had he said any thing to bear a different
construction i should not have believed him </s>
<s> 

my emma he means no such thing </s>
<s>  he only means

he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two
 interrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps than
he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the
subject </s>
<s> 

emma my dear emma

oh </s>
<s>  she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother
does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret
and hear his opinion </s>
<s>  depend upon it he will be much farther from doing
you justice </s>
<s>  he will think all the happiness all the advantage on
your side of the question </s>
<s>  all the merit on mine </s>
<s>  i wish i may not

ah </s>

john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be
happy together </s>

it </s>

surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the
kind </s>

if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying </s>
<s>  he had no idea of me </s>
<s>  he seems perfectly
unprepared for that </s>
<s> 

yes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into my
feelings </s>
<s>  what has he been judging by </s>
<s> i am not conscious of any
difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at
this time for my marrying any more than at another </s>
<s> but it was so i
suppose </s>

the other day </s>

father at last </s>
<s> she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of <abvr>
knightleys absence or when it came to the point her heart would have
failed her and she must have put it off </s>
<s>  but <abvr> knightley was to come
at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make </s>
<s> she was
forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too </s>
<s>  she must not make it a
more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself </s>
<s> 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune </s>
<s> with all the spirits she
could command she prepared him first for something strange and then
in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be
obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with no difficulty

going from hartfield </s>

<s>  she was introducing
no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better </s>

was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having <abvr>
knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea </s>

was all very true </s>

be glad to see him every day </s>

was </s>
<s> why could not they go on as they had done </s>
<s> 

mr </s>

<s>  but the worst was overcome
the idea was given </s>

emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded <abvr> knightleys whose fond
praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome </s>

used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion </s>

the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest
approbation </s>

consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst as a settled
and secondly as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance
of the two recommendations to <abvr> woodhouses mind </s>

upon as what was to be </s>
<s>  and every body by whom he was used to be
guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness </s>
<s>  and having some
feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some
time or otherin another year or two perhapsit might not be so very
bad if the marriage did take place </s>

mrs </s>

said to him in favour of the event </s>

saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in
urging him to the utmost </s>

to think he deserved even her dearest emma </s>
<s>  and it was in every respect
so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one
respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible
so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely
have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself
been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it
long ago </s>
<s> how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma
would have renounced their own home for hartfield </s>

an arrangement desirable </s>

woodhouse had been always felt in her husbands plans and her own for
a marriage between frank and emma </s>

themselves </s>

<s>  but here there was
nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future </s>
<s>  it was
all right all open all equal </s>
<s>  no sacrifice on any side worth the name </s>
<s> 
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without
one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections
as these was one of the happiest women in the world </s>
<s>  if any thing could
increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have
outgrown its first set of caps </s>
<s> 

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread </s>
<s>  and <abvr> weston
had his five minutes share of it </s>
<s>  but five minutes were enough to
familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind </s>
<s> he saw the advantages
of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife </s>
<s> 
but the wonder of it was very soon nothing </s>
<s>  and by the end of an hour he
was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it </s>

it is to be a secret i conclude said he </s>
<s>  these matters are always a
secret till it is found out that every body knows them </s>

he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that
point </s>

daughter </s>
<s> he must tell her </s>
<s>  and miss bates being present it passed
of course to <abvr> cole <abvr> perry and <abvr> elton immediately
afterwards </s>
<s>  it was no more than the principals were prepared for </s>
<s>  they
had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it
would be over highbury </s>
<s>  and were thinking of themselves as the evening
wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity </s>
<s> 

in general it was a very well approved match </s>

others might think her the most in luck </s>

and another might predict disagreements among their servants </s>

upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one
habitation the vicarage </s>

satisfaction </s>

chapter xviii


time passed on </s>
<s>  a few more tomorrows and the party from london would
be arriving </s>
<s>  it was an alarming change </s>
<s>  and emma was thinking of it one
morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when
mr </s>
<s>  knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by </s>
<s>  after the
first chat of pleasure he was silent </s>
<s>  and then in a graver tone began
with

i have something to tell you emma </s>
<s>  some news </s>
<s> 

good or bad </s>
<s>  said she quickly looking up in his face </s>
<s> 

i do not know which it ought to be called </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  good i am sure </s>
<s> i see it in your countenance </s>
<s>  you are trying not
to smile </s>
<s> 

i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid
my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  but why so </s>
<s> i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases
or amuses you should not please and amuse me too </s>
<s> 

there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not
think alike </s>
<s>  he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on
her face </s>
<s>  does nothing occur to you </s>
<s> do not you recollect </s>
<s> harriet
smith </s>
<s> 

her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though
she knew not what </s>
<s> 

have you heard from her yourself this morning </s>
<s>  cried he </s>
<s>  you have i
believe and know the whole </s>
<s> 

no i have not </s>
<s>  i know nothing </s>
<s>  pray tell me </s>
<s> 

you are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is </s>
<s>  harriet
smith marries robert martin </s>
<s> 

emma gave a start which did not seem like being preparedand her eyes
in eager gaze said no this is impossible </s>
<s>  but her lips were closed </s>
<s> 

it is so indeed continued <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  i have it from robert
martin himself </s>
<s>  he left me not half an hour ago </s>
<s> 

she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement </s>
<s> 

you like it my emma as little as i feared </s>
<s> i wish our opinions were
the same </s>
<s>  but in time they will </s>
<s>  time you may be sure will make one
or the other of us think differently </s>
<s>  and in the meanwhile we need not
talk much on the subject </s>
<s> 

you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself </s>
<s> 
it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i
cannot believe it </s>
<s>  it seems an impossibility </s>
<s> you cannot mean to say
that harriet smith has accepted robert martin </s>
<s>  you cannot mean that he
has even proposed to her againyet </s>
<s>  you only mean that he intends it </s>
<s> 

i mean that he has done it answered <abvr> knightley with smiling but
determined decision and been accepted </s>
<s> 

good god </s>
<s>  she cried </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> then having recourse to her workbasket
in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite
feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be
expressing she added well now tell me every thing </s>
<s>  make this
intelligible to me </s>
<s>  how where when </s>
<s> let me know it all </s>
<s>  i never was
more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy i assure you </s>
<s> howhow
has it been possible </s>
<s> 

it is a very simple story </s>
<s>  he went to town on business three days ago
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send
to john </s>
<s> he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was
asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys </s>
<s>  they were
going to take the two eldest boys to astleys </s>
<s>  the party was to be our
brother and sister henry johnand miss smith </s>
<s>  my friend robert could
not resist </s>
<s>  they called for him in their way </s>
<s>  were all extremely amused </s>
<s> 
and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he
didand in the course of that visit as i understand he found an
opportunity of speaking to harriet </s>
<s>  and certainly did not speak
in vain </s>
<s> she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is
deserving </s>
<s>  he came down by yesterdays coach and was with me this
morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first
on my affairs and then on his own </s>
<s>  this is all that i can relate of
the how where and when </s>
<s>  your friend harriet will make a much
longer history when you see her </s>
<s> she will give you all the minute
particulars which only womans language can make interesting </s>
<s> in our
communications we deal only in the great </s>
<s> however i must say that
robert martins heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing </s>
<s> 
and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that
on quitting their box at astleys my brother took charge of <abvr> john
knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry </s>
<s> 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith
rather uneasy </s>
<s> 

he stopped </s>
<s> emma dared not attempt any immediate reply </s>
<s>  to speak she
was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness </s>
<s> 
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad </s>
<s>  her silence disturbed
him </s>
<s>  and after observing her a little while he added

emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you
unhappy </s>
<s>  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected </s>
<s>  his
situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies your
friend </s>
<s>  and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him
as you know him more </s>
<s>  his good sense and good principles would delight
you </s>
<s> as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend
in better hands </s>
<s>  his rank in society i would alter if i could which is
saying a great deal i assure you emma </s>
<s> you laugh at me about william
larkins </s>
<s>  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin </s>
<s> 

he wanted her to look up and smile </s>
<s>  and having now brought herself not
to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering

you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match </s>
<s>  i think
harriet is doing extremely well </s>
<s>  her connexions may be worse than
his </s>
<s>  in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they
are </s>
<s>  i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize </s>
<s>  you
cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me </s>
<s>  how peculiarly unprepared
i was </s>
<s> for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined
against him much more than she was before </s>
<s> 

you ought to know your friend best replied <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  but i
should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl not likely to be
very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her </s>
<s> 

emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe
you know her quite as well as i do </s>
<s> but <abvr> knightley are you
perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him </s>
<s> 
i could suppose she might in timebut can she already </s>
<s> did not you
misunderstand him </s>
<s> you were both talking of other things </s>
<s>  of business
shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you in the confusion of
so many subjects mistake him </s>
<s> it was not harriets hand that he was
certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox </s>
<s> 

the contrast between the countenance and air of <abvr> knightley and robert
martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings and so strong
was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriets
side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis
no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was
really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature </s>
<s> 
it could not be otherwise </s>
<s> 

do you dare say this </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> knightley </s>
<s>  do you dare to suppose me
so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of </s>
<s> what do
you deserve </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with
any other </s>
<s>  and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer </s>
<s>  are
you quite sure that you understand the terms on which <abvr> martin and
harriet now are </s>
<s> 

i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he
told me she had accepted him </s>
<s>  and that there was no obscurity nothing
doubtful in the words he used </s>
<s>  and i think i can give you a proof that
it must be so </s>
<s>  he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do </s>
<s>  he knew
of no one but <abvr> goddard to whom he could apply for information of
her relations or friends </s>
<s>  could i mention any thing more fit to be done
than to go to <abvr> goddard </s>
<s>  i assured him that i could not </s>
<s>  then he
said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day </s>
<s> 

i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles
and most sincerely wish them happy </s>
<s> 

you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before </s>
<s> 

i hope sofor at that time i was a fool </s>
<s> 

and i am changed also </s>
<s>  for i am now very willing to grant you all
harriets good qualities </s>
<s>  i have taken some pains for your sake and for
robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much
in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her </s>
<s>  i have often
talked to her a good deal </s>
<s>  you must have seen that i did </s>
<s>  sometimes
indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor
martins cause which was never the case </s>
<s>  but from all my observations
i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good
notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in
the affections and utility of domestic life </s>
<s> much of this i have no
doubt she may thank you for </s>
<s> 

me </s>
<s>  cried emma shaking her head </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s>  poor harriet </s>
<s> 

she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more
praise than she deserved </s>
<s> 

their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her
father </s>
<s>  she was not sorry </s>
<s>  she wanted to be alone </s>
<s>  her mind was in a
state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be
collected </s>
<s>  she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits </s>
<s>  and till she
had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she
could be fit for nothing rational </s>
<s> 

her fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put the
horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls </s>
<s>  and she
had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing </s>
<s> 

the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be
imagined </s>
<s>  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of
harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for
security </s>
<s> what had she to wish for </s>
<s>  nothing but to grow more worthy of
him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own </s>
<s> 
nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility
and circumspection in future </s>
<s> 

serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her
resolutions </s>
<s>  and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the
very midst of them </s>
<s>  she must laugh at such a close </s>
<s>  such an end of the
doleful disappointment of five weeks back </s>
<s>  such a heartsuch a harriet </s>
<s> 

now there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would be a
pleasure </s>
<s>  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin </s>
<s> 

high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the
reflection that all necessity of concealment from <abvr> knightley would
soon be over </s>
<s>  the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to
practise might soon be over </s>
<s>  she could now look forward to giving him
that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to
welcome as a duty </s>
<s> 

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father </s>
<s>  not
always listening but always agreeing to what he said </s>
<s>  and whether in
speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his
being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor <abvr> weston would be
disappointed </s>
<s> 

they arrived </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  weston was alone in the drawingroom </s>
<s> but hardly
had they been told of the baby and <abvr> woodhouse received the thanks
for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the
blind of two figures passing near the window </s>
<s> 

it is frank and miss fairfax said <abvr> weston </s>
<s>  i was just going to
tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning </s>
<s>  he
stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the
day with us </s>
<s> they are coming in i hope </s>
<s> 

in half a minute they were in the room </s>
<s>  emma was extremely glad to
see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing
recollections on each side </s>
<s>  they met readily and smiling but with a
consciousness which at first allowed little to be said </s>
<s>  and having all
sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that
emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long
felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane
would yield its proportion of pleasure </s>
<s>  when <abvr> weston joined the
party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a
want of subject or animationor of courage and opportunity for frank
churchill to draw near her and say

i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message
in one of <abvr> westons letters </s>
<s>  i hope time has not made you less
willing to pardon </s>
<s>  i hope you do not retract what you then said </s>
<s> 

no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least </s>
<s>  i am
particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give you joy
in person </s>
<s> 

he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with
serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness </s>
<s> 

is not she looking well </s>
<s>  said he turning his eyes towards jane </s>
<s> 
better than she ever used to do </s>
<s> you see how my father and <abvr> weston
doat upon her </s>
<s> 

but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after
mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of
dixon </s>
<s> emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing </s>
<s> 

i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame </s>
<s> 

the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be </s>
<s>  but is it
possible that you had no suspicion </s>
<s> i mean of late </s>
<s>  early i know you
had none </s>
<s> 

i never had the smallest i assure you </s>
<s> 

that appears quite wonderful </s>
<s>  i was once very nearand i wish i
hadit would have been better </s>
<s>  but though i was always doing wrong
things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no
service </s>
<s> it would have been a much better transgression had i broken
the bond of secrecy and told you every thing </s>
<s> 

it is not now worth a regret said emma </s>
<s> 

i have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded to pay a
visit at randalls </s>
<s>  he wants to be introduced to her </s>
<s>  when the campbells
are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust
till we may carry her northward </s>
<s> but now i am at such a distance from
heris not it hard miss woodhouse </s>
<s> till this morning we have not
once met since the day of reconciliation </s>
<s>  do not you pity me </s>
<s> 

emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay
thought he cried

ah </s>
<s>  by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the
momenti hope <abvr> knightley is well </s>
<s>  he paused </s>
<s> she coloured and
laughed </s>
<s> i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish
in your favour </s>
<s>  let me return your congratulations </s>
<s> i assure you that
i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction </s>
<s> he is
a man whom i cannot presume to praise </s>
<s> 

emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style </s>
<s>  but
his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane
and his next words were

did you ever see such a skin </s>
<s> such smoothness </s>
<s>  such delicacy </s>
<s> and
yet without being actually fair </s>
<s> one cannot call her fair </s>
<s>  it is a
most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and haira most
distinguishing complexion </s>
<s>  so peculiarly the lady in it </s>
<s> just colour
enough for beauty </s>
<s> 

i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly </s>
<s>  but
do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so
pale </s>
<s> when we first began to talk of her </s>
<s> have you quite forgotten </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  nowhat an impudent dog i was </s>
<s> how could i dare

but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help
saying

i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you
had very great amusement in tricking us all </s>
<s> i am sure you had </s>
<s> i am
sure it was a consolation to you </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing </s>
<s>  i was the most
miserable wretch </s>
<s> 

not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth </s>
<s>  i am sure it was a
source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us
all in </s>
<s> perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the
truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same
situation </s>
<s>  i think there is a little likeness between us </s>
<s> 

he bowed </s>
<s> 

if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true
sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny </s>
<s>  the destiny which bids
fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own </s>
<s> 

true true he answered warmly </s>
<s>  no not true on your side </s>
<s>  you can
have no superior but most true on mine </s>
<s> she is a complete angel </s>
<s>  look

<s>  is not she an angel in every gesture </s>
<s>  observe the turn of her
throat </s>
<s>  observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father </s>
<s> you will
be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my
uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels </s>

i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head </s>

beautiful in her dark hair </s>
<s> 

very beautiful indeed replied emma </s>

gratefully burst out

how delighted i am to see you again </s>

looks </s>

certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come </s>

the others had been talking of the child <abvr> weston giving an account
of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the
infants appearing not quite well </s>
<s>  she believed she had been foolish
but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending
for <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  perhaps she ought to be ashamed but <abvr> weston had been
almost as uneasy as herself </s>
<s> in ten minutes however the child had
been perfectly well again </s>
<s>  this was her history </s>
<s>  and particularly
interesting it was to <abvr> woodhouse who commended her very much for
thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done
it </s>
<s>  she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the
slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment </s>
<s>  she could not be
too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often </s>
<s>  it was a pity perhaps
that he had not come last night </s>
<s>  for though the child seemed well now
very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had
seen it </s>
<s> 

frank churchill caught the name </s>
<s> 

perry </s>
<s>  said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss
fairfaxs eye </s>
<s>  my friend <abvr> perry </s>
<s>  what are they saying about <abvr>
perry </s>
<s> has he been here this morning </s>
<s> and how does he travel now </s>
<s> has
he set up his carriage </s>
<s> 

emma soon recollected and understood him </s>
<s>  and while she joined in the
laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she too was really
hearing him though trying to seem deaf </s>
<s> 

such an extraordinary dream of mine </s>
<s>  he cried </s>
<s>  i can never think of
it without laughing </s>
<s> she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse </s>
<s>  i see
it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown </s>
<s>  look at her </s>
<s>  do
not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter
which sent me the report is passing under her eyethat the whole
blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else
though pretending to listen to the others </s>
<s> 

jane was forced to smile completely for a moment </s>
<s>  and the smile partly
remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet
steady voice

how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me </s>
<s> they
will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them </s>
<s> 

he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly </s>
<s>  but
emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument </s>
<s>  and on leaving
randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she
felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really
regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more
sensible of <abvr> knightleys high superiority of character </s>
<s>  the happiness
of this most happy day received its completion in the animated
contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced </s>

chapter xix


if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a
momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her
attachment to <abvr> knightley and really able to accept another man from
unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the
recurrence of any such uncertainty </s>
<s>  a very few days brought the party
from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour
alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable
as it was </s>
<s> that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted <abvr> knightley
and was now forming all her views of happiness </s>
<s> 

harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first </s>
<s> 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and
selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with
the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the
fullest exultation in the present and future </s>
<s>  for as to her friends
approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by
meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations </s>
<s> harriet was
most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleys and the
dinner the next day </s>
<s>  she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight </s>
<s> 
but what did such particulars explain </s>
<s> the fact was as emma could now
acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin </s>
<s>  and that his
continuing to love her had been irresistible </s>
<s> beyond this it must ever
be unintelligible to emma </s>
<s> 

the event however was most joyful </s>
<s>  and every day was giving her fresh
reason for thinking so </s>
<s> harriets parentage became known </s>
<s>  she proved
to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the
comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to
have always wished for concealment </s>
<s> such was the blood of gentility
which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for </s>
<s> it was likely to
be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman </s>
<s>  but what
a connexion had she been preparing for <abvr> knightleyor for the
churchillsor even for <abvr> elton </s>
<s> the stain of illegitimacy
unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed </s>
<s> 

no objection was raised on the fathers side </s>
<s>  the young man was treated
liberally </s>
<s>  it was all as it should be </s>
<s>  and as emma became acquainted
with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully
acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could
bid fairest for her little friend </s>
<s>  she had no doubt of harriets
happiness with any goodtempered man </s>
<s>  but with him and in the home he
offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and
improvement </s>
<s>  she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her
and who had better sense than herself </s>
<s>  retired enough for safety
and occupied enough for cheerfulness </s>
<s>  she would be never led into
temptation nor left for it to find her out </s>
<s>  she would be respectable
and happy </s>
<s>  and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the
world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a
man </s>
<s> or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself </s>
<s> 

harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins
was less and less at hartfield </s>
<s>  which was not to be regretted </s>
<s> the
intimacy between her and emma must sink </s>
<s>  their friendship must change
into a calmer sort of goodwill </s>
<s>  and fortunately what ought to be
and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural
manner </s>
<s> 

before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as
no remembrances even connected with <abvr> elton as he stood before them
could impair </s>
<s> perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw <abvr> elton
but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on
herself </s>
<s> robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of
the three were the first to be married </s>
<s> 

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells </s>
<s> the <abvr> churchills
were also in town </s>
<s>  and they were only waiting for november </s>
<s> 

the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by
emma and <abvr> knightley </s>
<s> they had determined that their marriage ought
to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to
allow them the fortnights absence in a tour to the seaside which was
the plan </s>
<s> john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in
approving it </s>
<s>  but <abvr> woodhousehow was <abvr> woodhouse to be induced
to consent </s>
<s> he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a
distant event </s>
<s> 

when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were
almost hopeless </s>
<s> a second allusion indeed gave less pain </s>
<s> he
began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent ita very
promising step of the mind on its way to resignation </s>
<s>  still however he
was not happy </s>
<s>  nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters
courage failed </s>
<s>  she could not bear to see him suffering to know
him fancying himself neglected </s>
<s>  and though her understanding almost
acquiesced in the assurance of both the <abvr> knightleys that when
once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she
hesitatedshe could not proceed </s>
<s> 

in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden
illumination of <abvr> woodhouses mind or any wonderful change of his
nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another
way </s>
<s> mrs </s>
<s>  westons poultryhouse was robbed one night of all her
turkeysevidently by the ingenuity of man </s>
<s>  other poultryyards in
the neighbourhood also suffered </s>
<s> pilfering was housebreaking to <abvr>
woodhouses fears </s>
<s> he was very uneasy </s>
<s>  and but for the sense of his
soninlaws protection would have been under wretched alarm every
night of his life </s>
<s>  the strength resolution and presence of mind of the
mr </s>
<s>  knightleys commanded his fullest dependence </s>
<s>  while either of them
protected him and his hartfield was safe </s>
<s> but <abvr> john knightley must
be in london again by the end of the first week in november </s>
<s> 

the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the
moment she was able to fix her weddingdayand <abvr> elton was called
on within a month from the marriage of <abvr> and <abvr> robert martin to
join the hands of <abvr> knightley and miss woodhouse </s>
<s> 

the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have
no taste for finery or parade </s>
<s>  and <abvr> elton from the particulars
detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very
inferior to her own </s>
<s> very little white satin very few lace veils </s>
<s>  a
most pitiful business </s>
<s> selina would stare when she heard of it </s>
<s> but
in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence
the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the
ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union </s>
<s>
