shooters hill </s>

as the rest of the passengers did </s>
<s>  not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise under the circumstances but because the hill
and the harness and the mud and the mail were all so heavy that the
horses had three times already come to a stop besides once drawing the
coach across the road with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to blackheath </s>
<s>  reins and whip and coachman and guard however in
combination had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animals
are endued with reason </s>
<s>  and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty </s>
<s> 

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way through
the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints </s>
<s>  as often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand with a wary woho </s>
<s>  sohothen </s>
<s>  the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an
unusually emphatic horse denying that the coach could be got up the
hill </s>
<s>  whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a
nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind </s>
<s> 

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding
none </s>
<s>  a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do </s>
<s>  it was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coachlamps but these its own workings
and a few yards of road </s>
<s>  and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it as if they had made it all </s>
<s> 

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail </s>
<s>  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears and wore jackboots </s>
<s>  not one of the three could have said from
anything he saw what either of the other two was like </s>

were very shy of being confidential on a short notice for anybody on

<s>  as to the latter
when every postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in
the captains pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
nondescript it was the likeliest thing upon the cards </s>
<s>  so the guard
of the dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters hill as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail beating his feet
and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest before him where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horsepistols
deposited on a substratum of cutlass </s>

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers the passengers suspected one another and the guard they
all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses </s>

taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the

the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided negative

suit </s>

passengers squashing along by its side </s>

stopped and they kept close company with it </s>

stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent and open the coachdoor to let the passengers in </s>

his ears and looked back without contradicting </s>

of the coach added to the stillness of the night made it very quiet

<s>  the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach as if it were in a state of agitation </s>

passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard </s>

rains and then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses </s>

the streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley </s>

and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea </s>
<s>  indeed they were at sea and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest </s>
<s> 

for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger so
long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the darkness of their
condition </s>

the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stood outside
it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine </s>

of the shoulders </s>

there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke
he called to him across the way </s>
<s> 

say then my gaspard what do you do there </s>
<s> 

the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often
the way with his tribe </s>
<s>  it missed its mark and completely failed as is
often the way with his tribe too </s>
<s> 

what now </s>
<s>  are you a subject for the mad hospital </s>
<s>  said the wineshop
keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it </s>
<s>  why do you write
in the public streets </s>
<s>  is theretell me thouis there no other place
to write such words in </s>
<s> 

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally
perhaps not upon the jokers heart </s>
<s>  the joker rapped it with his
own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand and held out </s>
<s>  a joker of an extremely not to say wolfishly
practical character he looked under those circumstances </s>
<s> 

put it on put it on said the other </s>
<s>  call wine wine </s>
<s>  and finish
there </s>
<s>  with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers
dress such as it wasquite deliberately as having dirtied the hand on
his account </s>
<s>  and then recrossed the road and entered the wineshop </s>
<s> 

this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man of thirty
and he should have been of a hot temperament for although it was a
bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over his shoulder </s>
<s> 
his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows </s>
<s>  neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisplycurling short dark hair </s>
<s>  he was a dark man altogether with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them </s>
<s>  goodhumoured looking on
the whole but implacablelooking too </s>
<s>  evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose </s>
<s>  a man not desirable to be met rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side for nothing would turn
the man </s>
<s> 

madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in </s>
<s>  madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand
heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure of
manner </s>
<s>  there was a character about madame defarge from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided </s>
<s>  madame defarge being
sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large
earrings </s>
<s>  her knitting was before her but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick </s>
<s>  thus engaged with her right elbow supported
by her left hand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but
coughed just one grain of cough </s>
<s>  this in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way </s>
<s> 

the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in
a corner </s>
<s>  other company were there </s>
<s>  two playing cards two playing
dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine </s>
<s>  as he passed behind the counter he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man </s>
<s> 

what the devil do you do in that galley there </s>
<s>  said monsieur defarge
to himself </s>
<s>  i dont know you </s>
<s> 

but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter </s>
<s> 

how goes it jacques </s>
<s>  said one of these three to monsieur defarge </s>
<s>  is
all the spilt wine swallowed </s>
<s> 

every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge
picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line </s>
<s> 

it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur
defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or
of anything but black bread and death </s>
<s>  is it not so jacques </s>
<s> 

it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned </s>
<s> 

at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still
using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of
cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line </s>
<s> 

the last of the three now said his say as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  so much the worse </s>
<s>  a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques </s>
<s>  am i
right jacques </s>
<s> 

you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows up and
slightly rustled in her seat </s>
<s> 

hold then </s>
<s>  true </s>
<s>  muttered her husband </s>
<s>  gentlemenmy wife </s>
<s> 

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three
flourishes </s>
<s>  she acknowledged their homage by bending her head and
giving them a quick look </s>
<s>  then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wineshop took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit and became absorbed in it </s>
<s> 

gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her good day </s>
<s>  the chamber furnished bachelorfashion that you
wished to see and were inquiring for when i stepped out is on the
fifth floor </s>
<s>  the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here pointing with his hand near to the window of
my establishment </s>
<s>  but now that i remember one of you has already been
there and can show the way </s>
<s>  gentlemen adieu </s>
<s> 

they paid for their wine and left the place </s>
<s>  the eyes of monsieur
defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word </s>
<s> 

willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to
the door </s>
<s> 

their conference was very short but very decided </s>
<s>  almost at the first
word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive </s>
<s>  it had
not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out </s>
<s>  the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady and they too went out </s>
<s>  madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and saw nothing </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wineshop thus
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before </s>
<s>  it opened from a stinking little black courtyard
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses inhabited
by a great number of people </s>
<s>  in the gloomy tilepaved entry to the
gloomy tilepaved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master and put her hand to his lips </s>
<s>  it was
a gentle action but not at all gently done </s>
<s>  a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds </s>
<s>  he had no goodhumour
in his face nor any openness of aspect left but had become a secret
angry dangerous man </s>
<s> 

it is very high </s>
<s>  it is a little difficult </s>
<s>  better to begin slowly </s>
<s> 
 thus monsieur defarge in a stern voice to <abvr> lorry as they began
ascending the stairs </s>
<s> 

is he alone </s>
<s>  the latter whispered </s>
<s> 

alone </s>
<s>  god help him who should be with him </s>
<s>  said the other in the
same low voice </s>
<s> 

is he always alone then </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

of his own desire </s>
<s> 

of his own necessity </s>
<s>  as he was when i first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if i would take him and at my peril be
discreetas he was then so he is now </s>
<s> 

he is greatly changed </s>
<s> 

changed </s>
<s> 

the keeper of the wineshop stopped to strike the wall with his hand
and mutter a tremendous curse </s>
<s>  no direct answer could have been half so
forcible </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavier as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher </s>
<s> 

such a staircase with its accessories in the older and more crowded
parts of paris would be bad enough now </s>
<s>  but at that time it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses </s>
<s>  every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows </s>
<s>  the uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted
the air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities </s>
<s>  the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable </s>
<s>  through such an atmosphere by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison the way lay </s>
<s>  yielding to his own disturbance of mind and to
his young companions agitation which became greater every instant <abvr>
jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest </s>
<s>  each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted seemed to escape and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in </s>
<s>  through the rusted bars tastes rather than glimpses were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood </s>
<s>  and nothing within range nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notredame had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations </s>
<s> 

at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped for the
third time </s>
<s>  there was yet an upper staircase of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions to be ascended before the garret story
was reached </s>
<s>  the keeper of the wineshop always going a little in
advance and always going on the side which <abvr> lorry took as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady turned himself about
here and carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder took out a key </s>
<s> 

the door is locked then my friend </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry surprised </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired </s>
<s> 

i think it necessary to turn the key </s>
<s>  monsieur defarge whispered it
closer in his ear and frowned heavily </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s>  because he has lived so long locked up that he would be
frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to i know not what
harmif his door was left open </s>
<s> 

is it possible </s>
<s>  exclaimed <abvr> lorry </s>

<s> under

<s>  long live the devil </s>
<s>  let us go on </s>
<s> 

this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word
of it had reached the young ladys ears </s>
<s>  but by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety
and above all such dread and terror that <abvr> lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance </s>
<s> 

courage dear miss </s>
<s>  courage </s>

<s>  let our good friend here assist you on that side </s>
<s> 
thats well friend defarge </s>
<s>  come now </s>
<s>  business business </s>
<s> 

they went up slowly and softly </s>
<s>  the staircase was short and they were
soon at the top </s>
<s>  there as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at
once in sight of three men whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged through some chinks or holes in the wall </s>
<s>  on hearing
footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wineshop </s>
<s> 

i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieur
defarge </s>
<s>  leave us good boys </s>
<s>  we have business here </s>
<s> 

the three glided by and went silently down </s>
<s> 

there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of
the wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alone <abvr>
lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger </s>
<s> 

do you make a show of monsieur manette </s>
<s> 

i show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few </s>
<s> 

is that well </s>
<s> 

i think it is well </s>
<s> 

who are the few </s>
<s>  how do you choose them </s>
<s> 

i choose them as real men of my namejacques is my nameto whom the
sight is likely to do good </s>
<s>  enough </s>
<s>  you are english </s>
<s>  that is another
thing </s>
<s>  stay there if you please a little moment </s>
<s> 

with an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in
through the crevice in the wall </s>
<s>  soon raising his head again he struck
twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to
make a noise there </s>
<s>  with the same intention he drew the key across it
three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned
it as heavily as he could </s>
<s> 

the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the
room and said something </s>
<s>  a faint voice answered something </s>
<s>  little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side </s>
<s> 

he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry
got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held her </s>
<s>  for he
felt that she was sinking </s>
<s> 

aaabusiness business </s>
<s>  he urged with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek </s>
<s>  come in come in </s>
<s> 

i am afraid of it she answered shuddering </s>
<s> 

of it </s>
<s>  what </s>
<s> 

i mean of him </s>
<s>  of my father </s>
<s> 

rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room </s>
<s>  he sat her
down just within the door and held her clinging to him </s>
<s> 

defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside
took out the key again and held it in his hand </s>
<s>  all this he did
methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make </s>
<s>  finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was </s>
<s>  he stopped there and faced round </s>
<s> 

the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim
and dark </s>
<s>  for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the
roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street </s>
<s>  unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any
other door of french construction </s>
<s>  to exclude the cold one half of this
door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way </s>
<s> 
such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it
was difficult on first coming in to see anything </s>
<s>  and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity </s>
<s>  yet work of that kind was being
done in the garret </s>
<s>  for with his back towards the door and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at
him a whitehaired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very
busy making shoes </s>
<s> 




vi </s>
<s>  the shoemaker


good day </s>
<s>  said monsieur defarge looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking </s>
<s> 

it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation as if it were at a distance </s>
<s> 

good day </s>
<s> 

you are still hard at work i see </s>
<s> 

after a long silence the head was lifted for another moment and the
voice replied yesi am working </s>
<s>  this time a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again </s>
<s> 

the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful </s>
<s>  it was not the
faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it </s>
<s>  its deplorable peculiarity was that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse </s>
<s>  it was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago </s>
<s>  so entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain </s>
<s>  so sunken and
suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground </s>
<s>  so expressive
it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die </s>
<s> 

some minutes of silent work had passed </s>
<s>  and the haggard eyes had looked
up again </s>
<s>  not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical
perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood was not yet empty </s>
<s> 

i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker
to let in a little more light here </s>
<s>  you can bear a little more </s>
<s> 

the shoemaker stopped his work </s>
<s>  looked with a vacant air of listening
at the floor on one side of him </s>
<s>  then similarly at the floor on the
other side of him </s>
<s>  then upward at the speaker </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

you can bear a little more light </s>
<s> 

i must bear it if you let it in </s>
<s>  laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word </s>
<s> 

the opened halfdoor was opened a little further and secured at that
angle for the time </s>
<s>  a broad ray of light fell into the garret and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his
labour </s>
<s>  his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench </s>
<s>  he had a white beard raggedly cut but not very
long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes </s>
<s>  the hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really
otherwise </s>
<s>  but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so </s>
<s> 
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body
to be withered and worn </s>
<s>  he and his old canvas frock and his loose
stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion
from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchmentyellow that it would have been hard to say which was which </s>
<s> 

he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones
of it seemed transparent </s>
<s>  so he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze
pausing in his work </s>
<s>  he never looked at the figure before him without
first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound </s>
<s>  he never spoke without
first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak </s>
<s> 

are you going to finish that pair of shoes today </s>
<s>  asked defarge
motioning to <abvr> lorry to come forward </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today </s>
<s> 

i cant say that i mean to </s>
<s>  i suppose so </s>
<s>  i dont know </s>
<s> 

but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door </s>
<s>  when
he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker
looked up </s>
<s>  he showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it his lips and his nails were of the same pale leadcolour and then
the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe </s>
<s>  the
look and the action had occupied but an instant </s>
<s> 

you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge </s>
<s> 

what did you say </s>
<s> 

here is a visitor </s>
<s> 

the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his
work </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said defarge </s>
<s>  here is monsieur who knows a wellmade shoe when
he sees one </s>
<s>  show him that shoe you are working at </s>
<s>  take it monsieur </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry took it in his hand </s>
<s> 

tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name </s>
<s> 

there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied </s>
<s> 

i forget what it was you asked me </s>
<s>  what did you say </s>
<s> 

i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieurs
information </s>
<s> 

it is a ladys shoe </s>
<s>  it is a young ladys walkingshoe </s>
<s>  it is in the
present mode </s>
<s>  i never saw the mode </s>
<s>  i have had a pattern in my hand </s>
<s>  he
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride </s>
<s> 

and the makers name </s>
<s>  said defarge </s>
<s> 

now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and
so on in regular changes without a moments intermission </s>
<s>  the task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or
endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a
fastdying man </s>
<s> 

did you ask me for my name </s>
<s> 

assuredly i did </s>
<s> 

one hundred and five north tower </s>
<s> 

is that all </s>
<s> 

one hundred and five north tower </s>
<s> 

with a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work
again until the silence was again broken </s>
<s> 

you are not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry looking steadfastly
at him </s>
<s> 

his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him </s>
<s>  but as no help came from that quarter they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground </s>
<s> 

i am not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  no i was not a shoemaker by trade </s>
<s>  ii
learnt it here </s>
<s>  i taught myself </s>
<s>  i asked leave to

he lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time </s>
<s>  his eyes came slowly back at last to the face
from which they had wandered </s>
<s>  when they rested on it he started and
resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a
subject of last night </s>
<s> 

i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficulty after
a long while and i have made shoes ever since </s>
<s> 

as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him <abvr>
lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face </s>
<s> 

monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me </s>
<s> 

the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner </s>
<s> 

monsieur manette </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry laid his hand upon defarges arm </s>
<s>  do you
remember nothing of this man </s>
<s>  look at him </s>
<s>  look at me </s>
<s>  is there no old
banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your
mind monsieur manette </s>
<s> 

as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at <abvr>
lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him </s>
<s>  they were overclouded
again they were fainter they were gone </s>
<s>  but they had been there </s>
<s>  and
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where
she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him but which were now extending towards him
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression
repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her </s>
<s> 

darkness had fallen on him in its place </s>
<s>  he looked at the two less and
less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way </s>
<s>  finally with a deep long sigh he
took the shoe up and resumed his work </s>
<s> 

have you recognised him monsieur </s>
<s>  asked defarge in a whisper </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a moment </s>
<s>  at first i thought it quite hopeless but i have
unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew so
well </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s>  let us draw further back </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 

she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on
which he sat </s>
<s>  there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour </s>
<s> 

not a word was spoken not a sound was made </s>
<s>  she stood like a spirit
beside him and he bent over his work </s>
<s> 

it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand for his shoemakers knife </s>
<s>  it lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood </s>
<s>  he had taken it up and was
stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress </s>
<s>  he
raised them and saw her face </s>
<s>  the two spectators started forward
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand </s>
<s>  she had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife though they had </s>
<s> 

he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began
to form some words though no sound proceeded from them </s>
<s>  by degrees in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s> 

with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her
lips and kissed them to him </s>
<s>  then clasped them on her breast as if she
laid his ruined head there </s>
<s> 

you are not the gaolers daughter </s>
<s> 

she sighed no </s>
<s> 

who are you </s>
<s> 

not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench
beside him </s>
<s>  he recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm </s>
<s>  a strange
thrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame </s>
<s>  he
laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her </s>

tellsons bank by temple bar was an oldfashioned place even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty </s>
<s>  it was very small very
dark very ugly very incommodious </s>
<s>  it was an oldfashioned place
moreover in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were
proud of its smallness proud of its darkness proud of its ugliness
proud of its incommodiousness </s>
<s>  they were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars and were fired by an express conviction that if
it were less objectionable it would be less respectable </s>
<s>  this was
no passive belief but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business </s>
<s>  tellsons they said wanted
no elbowroom tellsons wanted no light tellsons wanted no
embellishment </s>

<s> s might or snooks brothers might </s>

tellsons thank heaven </s>
<s> 

any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding tellsons </s>
<s>  in this respect the house was much
on a par with the country </s>
<s>  which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable but were only the more respectable </s>
<s> 

thus it had come to pass that tellsons was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience </s>
<s>  after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat you fell into tellsons down two steps
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop with two little
counters where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows which were always under a showerbath of mud from fleetstreet
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper and the
heavy shadow of temple bar </s>
<s>  if your business necessitated your seeing
the house you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back
where you meditated on a misspent life until the house came with its
hands in its pockets and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight </s>
<s>  your money came out of or went into wormy old wooden
drawers particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut </s>
<s>  your banknotes had a musty odour as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again </s>
<s>  your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two </s>
<s>  your deeds got into extemporised strongrooms
made of kitchens and sculleries and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the bankinghouse air </s>
<s>  your lighter boxes of family
papers went upstairs into a barmecide room that always had a great
diningtable in it and never had a dinner and where even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty the first letters written to you
by your old love or by your little children were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows by the heads
exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
abyssinia or ashantee </s>
<s> 

but indeed at that time putting to death was a recipe much in vogue

death is natures remedy for all things and why not legislations </s>

particular case and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after </s>
<s>  thus tellsons in its day like greater places of business
its contemporaries had taken so many lives that if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately

well well said the old clerk </s>
<s>  we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood </s>
<s>  some of us have damp ways and some of us have dry
ways </s>
<s>  here is the letter </s>
<s>  go along </s>
<s> 

jerry took the letter and remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of you are a lean old one
too made his bow informed his son in passing of his destination
and went his way </s>
<s> 

they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outside newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it </s>
<s> 
but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised and where dire diseases were bred that came
into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulled him off the bench </s>
<s>  it
had more than once happened that the judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him </s>
<s> 
for the rest the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly innyard
from which pale travellers set out continually in carts and coaches on
a violent passage into the other world </s>
<s>  traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road and shaming few good citizens if any </s>
<s> 
so powerful is use and so desirable to be good use in the beginning </s>
<s>  it
was famous too for the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent </s>
<s>  also for
the whippingpost another dear old institution very humanising and
softening to behold in action </s>
<s>  also for extensive transactions in
bloodmoney another fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under heaven </s>
<s>  altogether the old bailey at that date was a choice
illustration of the precept that whatever is is right </s>
<s>  an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy did it not include the troublesome
consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong </s>
<s> 

making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought and handed in
his letter through a trap in it </s>
<s>  for people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play in bedlamonly the
former entertainment was much the dearer </s>
<s>  therefore all the old bailey
doors were well guardedexcept indeed the social doors by which the
criminals got there and those were always left wide open </s>
<s> 

after some delay and demur the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way and allowed <abvr> jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into
court </s>
<s> 

whats on </s>
<s>  he asked in a whisper of the man he found himself next
to </s>
<s> 

nothing yet </s>
<s> 

whats coming on </s>
<s> 

the treason case </s>
<s> 

the quartering one eh </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  returned the man with a relish </s>
<s>  hell be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged and then hell be taken down and sliced before his own
face and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on
and then his head will be chopped off and hell be cut into quarters </s>
<s> 
thats the sentence </s>
<s> 

if hes found guilty you mean to say </s>
<s>  jerry added by way of proviso </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  theyll find him guilty said the other </s>
<s>  dont you be afraid of
that </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  crunchers attention was here diverted to the doorkeeper whom he
saw making his way to <abvr> lorry with the note in his hand </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry
sat at a table among the gentlemen in wigs </s>
<s>  not far from a wigged
gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundle of papers
before him </s>
<s>  and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets whose whole attention when <abvr> cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court </s>
<s>  after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand jerry attracted the notice of <abvr> lorry who had stood up
to look for him and who quietly nodded and sat down again </s>
<s> 

whats he got to do with the case </s>
<s>  asked the man he had spoken with </s>
<s> 

blest if i know said jerry </s>
<s> 

what have you got to do with it then if a person may inquire </s>
<s> 

blest if i know that either said jerry </s>
<s> 

the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court stopped the dialogue </s>
<s>  presently the dock became the
central point of interest </s>
<s>  two gaolers who had been standing there
went out and the prisoner was brought in and put to the bar </s>
<s> 

everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling stared at him </s>
<s>  all the human breath in the place rolled
at him like a sea or a wind or a fire </s>
<s>  eager faces strained round
pillars and corners to get a sight of him </s>
<s>  spectators in back rows
stood up not to miss a hair of him </s>
<s>  people on the floor of the court
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them to help
themselves at anybodys cost to a view of himstood atiptoe got
upon ledges stood upon next to nothing to see every inch of him </s>
<s> 
conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of newgate jerry stood </s>
<s>  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer and gin and tea and coffee and what not
that flowed at him and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain </s>
<s> 

the object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of about
fiveandtwenty wellgrown and welllooking with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye </s>
<s>  his condition was that of a young gentleman </s>
<s>  he was plainly
dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which was long and
dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck </s>
<s>  more to be out
of his way than for ornament </s>
<s>  as an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun </s>
<s>  he was otherwise quite selfpossessed
bowed to the judge and stood quiet </s>
<s> 

the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at
was not a sort that elevated humanity </s>
<s>  had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his
fascination </s>
<s>  the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled
was the sight </s>
<s>  the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder yielded the sensation </s>
<s>  whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest according to their several arts and
powers of selfdeceit the interest was at the root of it ogreish </s>
<s> 

silence in the court </s>
<s>  charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to
an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle and jangle for that
he was a false traitor to our serene illustrious excellent and so
forth prince our lord the king by reason of his having on divers
occasions and by divers means and ways assisted lewis the french
king in his wars against our said serene illustrious excellent and
so forth </s>
<s>  that was to say by coming and going between the dominions of
our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth and those of the
said french lewis and wickedly falsely traitorously and otherwise
eviladverbiously revealing to the said french lewis what forces our
said serene illustrious excellent and so forth had in preparation
to send to canada and north america </s>
<s>  this much jerry with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it made out with
huge satisfaction and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid and over and over again aforesaid charles darnay stood
there before him upon his trial </s>
<s>  that the jury were swearing in </s>
<s>  and
that <abvr> attorneygeneral was making ready to speak </s>
<s> 

the accused who was and who knew he was being mentally hanged
beheaded and quartered by everybody there neither flinched from
the situation nor assumed any theatrical air in it </s>
<s>  he was quiet and
attentive </s>
<s>  watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest </s>
<s> 
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him so
composedly that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn </s>
<s>  the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever </s>
<s> 

over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light down
upon him </s>
<s>  crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it and had passed from its surface and this earths together </s>
<s>  haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead </s>
<s>  some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved may have struck the prisoners mind </s>

that as it may a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face he looked up </s>
<s>  and when he saw the glass his
face flushed and his right hand pushed the herbs away </s>
<s> 

it happened that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left </s>
<s>  about on a level with his eyes there sat
in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested </s>
<s>  so immediately and so much to the changing of his
aspect that all the eyes that were turned upon him turned to them </s>
<s> 

the spectators saw in the two figures a young lady of little more than
twenty and a gentleman who was evidently her father </s>
<s>  a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair
and a certain indescribable intensity of face </s>
<s>  not of an active kind
but pondering and selfcommuning </s>
<s>  when this expression was upon him he
looked as if he were old </s>
<s>  but when it was stirred and broken upas
it was now in a moment on his speaking to his daughterhe became a
handsome man not past the prime of life </s>
<s> 

his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm as she sat by
him and the other pressed upon it </s>

dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner </s>

been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion

noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shown that starers who

jerry the messenger who had made his own observations in his own
manner and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption stretched his neck to hear who they were </s>

axe and hammer the nails into the scaffold </s>
<s> 




iii </s>
<s>  a disappointment


mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral had to inform the jury that the prisoner before
them though young in years was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life </s>
<s>  that this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of today or of yesterday or
even of last year or of the year before </s>
<s>  that it was certain the
prisoner had for longer than that been in the habit of passing and
repassing between france and england on secret business of which
he could give no honest account </s>
<s>  that if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered </s>
<s> 
that providence however had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach to ferret out the nature of the
prisoners schemes and struck with horror to disclose them to his
majestys chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council </s>
<s> 
that this patriot would be produced before them </s>
<s>  that his position and
attitude were on the whole sublime </s>
<s>  that he had been the prisoners
friend but at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom on the sacred altar of his country </s>
<s>  that if statues
were decreed in britain as in ancient greece and rome to public
benefactors this shining citizen would assuredly have had one </s>
<s>  that as
they were not so decreed he probably would not have one </s>
<s>  that virtue
as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have word for word at the tips of their tongues </s>
<s> 
whereat the jurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages was in a manner contagious </s>
<s>  more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love of country </s>
<s> 
that the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the crown to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour had
communicated itself to the prisoners servant and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his masters tabledrawers and pockets
and secrete his papers </s>
<s>  that he <abvr> attorneygeneral was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant </s>
<s>  but that
in a general way he preferred him to his <abvr> attorneygenerals
brothers and sisters and honoured him more than his <abvr>
attorneygenerals father and mother </s>
<s>  that he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise </s>
<s>  that the evidence of these two
witnesses coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his majestys forces and of their disposition and preparation both by
sea and land and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power </s>
<s>  that these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoners handwriting </s>
<s>  but that it was all the
same </s>
<s>  that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions </s>
<s>  that the proof
would go back five years and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the british troops and the americans </s>
<s> 
that for these reasons the jury being a loyal jury as he knew they
were and being a responsible jury as they knew they were must
positively find the prisoner guilty and make an end of him whether
they liked it or not </s>
<s>  that they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows </s>
<s>  that they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows </s>
<s>  that they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows </s>
<s>  in short that
there never more could be for them or theirs any laying of heads upon
pillows at all unless the prisoners head was taken off </s>
<s>  that head
mr </s>
<s>  attorneygeneral concluded by demanding of them in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone </s>
<s> 

when the attorneygeneral ceased a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner in
anticipation of what he was soon to become </s>
<s>  when toned down again the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witnessbox </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  solicitorgeneral then following his leaders lead examined the
patriot </s>
<s>  john barsad gentleman by name </s>
<s>  the story of his pure soul was
exactly what <abvr> attorneygeneral had described it to beperhaps if
it had a fault a little too exactly </s>
<s>  having released his noble bosom
of its burden he would have modestly withdrawn himself but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him sitting not far from <abvr>

great rate </s>

simplicity four years ago </s>

packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner had engaged him </s>

charitynever thought of such a thing </s>

the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soon afterwards </s>
<s>  in arranging
his clothes while travelling he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoners pockets over and over again </s>
<s>  he had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoners desk </s>
<s>  he had not put them there first </s>
<s>  he
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen
at calais and similar lists to french gentlemen both at calais and
boulogne </s>
<s>  he loved his country and couldnt bear it and had given
information </s>

he had been maligned respecting a mustardpot but it turned out to be
only a plated one </s>

difficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he was

washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the
third </s>

a singular circumstance then arose in the case </s>
<s>  the object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down with some fellowplotter untracked
in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago and
got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did
not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more
to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information </s>
<s>  a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required
in the coffeeroom of an hotel in that garrisonanddockyard town
waiting for another person </s>
<s>  the prisoners counsel was crossexamining
this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him </s>
<s>  opening
this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner </s>
<s> 

you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner </s>
<s> 

the witness was quite sure </s>
<s> 

did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner </s>
<s> 

not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken </s>
<s> 

look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the
prisoner </s>
<s>  how say you </s>
<s>  are they very like each other </s>
<s> 

allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise
not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought
into comparison </s>
<s>  my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became
much more remarkable </s>
<s>  my lord inquired of <abvr> stryver the prisoners
counsel whether they were next to try <abvr> carton name of my learned
friend for treason </s>
<s>  but <abvr> stryver replied to my lord no </s>
<s>  but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might
happen twice </s>
<s>  whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so
confident having seen it </s>
<s>  and more </s>
<s>  the upshot of which was to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence </s>
<s>  he had now to attend while <abvr>
stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit
of clothes </s>
<s>  showing them how the patriot barsad was a hired spy and
traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judaswhich he certainly did look
rather like </s>
<s>  how the virtuous servant cly was his friend and partner
and was worthy to be </s>
<s>  how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family
affairs in france he being of french extraction did require his making
those passages across the channelthough what those affairs were a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him
even for his life to disclose </s>
<s>  how the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together </s>
<s> with the exception of that
reference to george washington which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke </s>
<s> 
how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears and therefore <abvr> attorneygeneral had made the most of it </s>
<s> 
how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the
state trials of this country were full </s>
<s>  but there my lord interposed
with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  stryver then called his few witnesses and <abvr> cruncher had next to
attend while <abvr> attorneygeneral turned the whole suit of clothes <abvr>
stryver had fitted on the jury inside out </s>
<s>  showing how barsad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the
prisoner a hundred times worse </s>
<s>  lastly came my lord himself turning
the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner </s>
<s> 

and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court
changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement </s>
<s> 
while his learned friend <abvr> stryver massing his papers before him
whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury </s>
<s>  while all the spectators moved more or less and
grouped themselves anew </s>
<s>  while even my lord himself arose from his seat
and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish </s>
<s>  this one man
sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his
hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day </s>
<s>  something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him
a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness
when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the
lookerson taking note of him now said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike </s>
<s>  <abvr> cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour and added id hold half a guinea
that he dont get no lawwork to do </s>
<s>  dont look like the sort of one
to get any do he </s>
<s> 

yet this <abvr> carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in </s>

<s>  look to that young lady </s>
<s>  help the gentleman to take her out </s>
<s> 
dont you see she will fall </s>
<s> 

there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much
sympathy with her father </s>
<s>  it had evidently been a great distress to
him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled </s>
<s>  he had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud
ever since </s>
<s>  as he passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a
moment spoke through their foreman </s>
<s> 

they were not agreed and wished to retire </s>
<s>  my lord perhaps with george
washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward
and retired himself </s>
<s>  the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted </s>
<s>  it began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while </s>
<s>  the spectators dropped off to get
refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat
down </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out
now reappeared and beckoned to jerry </s>

his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine </s>

they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers

him to get up and steep his towels anew </s>

jug and basin he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe </s>

invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle and a fresh application

<s>  hundreds of people


the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet streetcorner not
far from sohosquare </s>
<s>  on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason and carried
it as to the public interest and memory far out to sea <abvr> jarvis
lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived
on his way to dine with the doctor </s>
<s>  after several relapses into
businessabsorption <abvr> lorry had become the doctors friend and the
quiet streetcorner was the sunny part of his life </s>
<s> 

on this certain fine sunday <abvr> lorry walked towards soho early in
the afternoon for three reasons of habit </s>
<s>  firstly because on fine
sundays he often walked out before dinner with the doctor and lucie </s>
<s> 
secondly because on unfavourable sundays he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend talking reading looking out of window and
generally getting through the day </s>
<s>  thirdly because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew how the ways of the
doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them </s>
<s> 

a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not to be
found in london </s>
<s>  there was no way through it and the front windows of
the doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it </s>
<s>  there were few buildings then
north of the oxfordroad and foresttrees flourished and wild flowers
grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanished fields </s>
<s>  as a
consequence country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement </s>
<s>  and there was many a good south wall not far off on which
the peaches ripened in their season </s>
<s> 

the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day </s>
<s>  but when the streets grew hot the corner was in shadow
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness </s>
<s>  it was a cool spot staid but cheerful a wonderful
place for echoes and a very harbour from the raging streets </s>
<s> 

there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage and
there was </s>
<s>  the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house where
several callings purported to be pursued by day but whereof little was
audible any day and which was shunned by all of them at night </s>
<s>  in
a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where a planetree
rustled its green leaves churchorgans claimed to be made and silver
to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hallas if
he had beaten himself precious and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors </s>
<s>  very little of these trades or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live upstairs or of a dim coachtrimming maker asserted to have
a countinghouse below was ever heard or seen </s>
<s>  occasionally a stray
workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered
about there or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard or a
thump from the golden giant </s>
<s>  these however were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the planetree behind
the house and the echoes in the corner before it had their own way
from sunday morning unto saturday night </s>
<s> 

doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him </s>
<s> 
his scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and
he earned as much as he wanted </s>
<s> 

these things were within <abvr> jarvis lorrys knowledge thoughts and
notice when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner
on the fine sunday afternoon </s>
<s> 

doctor manette at home </s>

possibly at home but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pross as to admission or denial of the
fact </s>
<s> 

as i am at home myself said <abvr> lorry ill go upstairs </s>
<s> 

although the doctors daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics </s>
<s>  simple as the furniture was it was set off
by so many little adornments of no value but for their taste and fancy
that its effect was delightful </s>

rooms from the largest object to the least </s>

delicate hands clear eyes and good sense </s>

themselves and so expressive of their originator that as <abvr> lorry
stood looking about him the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time whether he approved </s>

there were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them

he detected all around him walked from one to another </s>

the best room and in it were lucies birds and flowers and books

<s>  the second was
the doctors consultingroom used also as the diningroom </s>
<s>  the third
changingly speckled by the rustle of the planetree in the yard was the
doctors bedroom and there in a corner stood the disused shoemakers
bench and tray of tools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wineshop in the suburb of saint antoine in paris </s>

i wonder said <abvr> lorry pausing in his looking about that he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him </s>

and why wonder at that </s>
<s>  was the abrupt inquiry that made him start </s>

it proceeded from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose
acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover and

i dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird to
come here looking after her said miss pross </s>

hundreds said miss pross </s>

it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her

she exaggerated it </s>

dear me </s>

your affidavit if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothingsince she was ten years old </s>
<s>  and its really very hard
 said miss pross </s>
<s> 

not seeing with precision what was very hard <abvr> lorry shook his head </s>
<s> 
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything </s>
<s> 

all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet
are always turning up said miss pross </s>
<s>  when you began it

i began it miss pross </s>

didnt you </s>

<s> 

oh </s>

<s> 

it wasnt ending it i suppose </s>
<s>  i say when you began it it was hard
enough </s>
<s>  not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is no imputation on
him for it was not to be expected that anybody should be under any
circumstances </s>
<s>  but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have forgiven
him to take ladybirds affections away from me </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous but he also knew her by
this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one of those
unselfish creaturesfound only among womenwho will for pure love and
admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost

never fortunate enough to gain to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives </s>
<s>  he knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart </s>
<s>  so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint he had such an exalted
respect for it that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mindwe all make such arrangements more or lesshe stationed miss
pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by nature and art who had balances at tellsons </s>

there never was nor will be but one man worthy of ladybird said
miss pross </s>
<s>  and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made a
mistake in life </s>
<s> 

here again </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorrys inquiries into miss prosss personal history had
established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed as a stake to
speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore with
no touch of compunction </s>
<s>  miss prosss fidelity of belief in solomon
deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious
matter with <abvr> lorry and had its weight in his good opinion of her </s>

now and then said miss pross </s>

do you suppose <abvr> lorry went on with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye as it looked kindly at her that doctor manette has any

rather wishing his modest adjective away <abvr> lorry replied no no
no </s>

manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured

<s>  i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached and who is so devotedly attached to him </s>
<s>  believe me miss
pross i dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of
zealous interest </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  to the best of my understanding and bads the best youll tell
me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid

afraid </s>

its plain enough i should think why he may be </s>
<s>  its a dreadful
remembrance </s>
<s>  besides that his loss of himself grew out of it </s>
<s>  not
knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again </s>
<s>  that alone wouldnt make the
subject pleasant i should think </s>
<s> 

it was a profounder remark than <abvr> lorry had looked for </s>
<s>  true said
he and fearful to reflect upon </s>
<s>  yet a doubt lurks in my mind miss
pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him </s>
<s>  indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence </s>
<s> 

cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head </s>
<s>  touch that
string and he instantly changes for the worse </s>
<s>  better leave it alone </s>
<s> 
in short must leave it alone like or no like </s>
<s>  sometimes he gets up in
the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking
up and down walking up and down in his room </s>
<s>  ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down walking up and down in
his old prison </s>
<s>  she hurries to him and they go on together walking up

<s>  but he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him </s>
<s>  in silence they go walking up and down
together walking up and down together till her love and company have
brought him to himself </s>
<s> 

notwithstanding miss prosss denial of her own imagination there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea
in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to
her possessing such a thing </s>
<s> 

the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes </s>
<s>  it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going </s>
<s> 

here they are </s>
<s>  said miss pross rising to break up the conference </s>
<s> 
and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon </s>
<s> 

it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such a
peculiar ear of a place that as <abvr> lorry stood at the open window
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied
they would never approach </s>
<s>  not only would the echoes die away as though
the steps had gone </s>
<s>  but echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand </s>
<s>  however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them </s>
<s> 

miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking
off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and
folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women </s>
<s>  her darling was a pleasant
sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do
playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own
chamber and cried </s>
<s>  the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at
them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would
have had more if it were possible </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry was a pleasant sight too
beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home </s>
<s>  but no
hundreds of people came to see the sights and <abvr> lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of miss prosss prediction </s>
<s> 

dinnertime and still no hundreds of people </s>
<s>  in the arrangements of
the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and
always acquitted herself marvellously </s>
<s>  her dinners of a very modest
quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their
contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be
better </s>
<s>  miss prosss friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of
impoverished french who tempted by shillings and halfcrowns would
impart culinary mysteries to her </s>
<s>  from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress
or cinderellas godmother </s>
<s>  who would send out for a fowl a rabbit
a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she
pleased </s>
<s> 

on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower
regions or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance </s>
<s>  on this occasion
miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her unbent exceedingly </s>
<s>  so the dinner was very pleasant too </s>

it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the planetree and they should sit
there in the air </s>

things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing france </s>

much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four
strong men besides the cook </s>
<s>

<s>  it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the
chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to
conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneurs lips </s>

watches poured the chocolate out </s>

dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring heavens </s>
<s>  deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men </s>
<s>  he must have died of two </s>
<s> 

monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy
and the grand opera were charmingly represented </s>
<s>  monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights with fascinating company </s>
<s>  so polite and so
impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets than the needs of all france </s>
<s>  a happy circumstance
for france as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured </s>
<s> always was for england by way of example in the regretted
days of the merry stuart who sold it </s>
<s> 

monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which
was to let everything go on in its own way </s>
<s>  of particular public
business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his waytend to his own power and pocket </s>
<s>  of his pleasures general and
particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world
was made for them </s>
<s>  the text of his order altered from the original
by only a pronoun which is not much ran </s>
<s>  the earth and the fulness
thereof are mine saith monseigneur </s>
<s> 

yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs both private and public </s>
<s>  and he had as to both classes of
affairs allied himself perforce with a farmergeneral </s>
<s>  as to finances
public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could </s>
<s>  as to finances
private because farmergenerals were rich and monseigneur after
generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor </s>
<s>  hence
monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could
wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmergeneral
poor in family </s>
<s>  which farmergeneral carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer
rooms much prostrated before by mankindalways excepting superior

pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of
monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got </s>
<s>  these were to be told off by the score and the
score </s>
<s>  people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were
no less abundant </s>
<s>  doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly
patients in the antechambers of monseigneur </s>

discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears

cardtowers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving

the finest breeding which was at that remarkable timeand has been
sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur </s>
<s>  such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies

of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and
appearance owned to being a mother </s>

bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing
known to the fashion </s>

and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty </s>

the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon monseigneur </s>
<s>  in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong </s>
<s>  as a promising way of setting
them right half of the halfdozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the
spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible fingerpost to the
future for monseigneurs guidance </s>
<s>  besides these dervishes were other
three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a
jargon about the centre of truth </s>
<s>  holding that man had got out of the
centre of truthwhich did not need much demonstrationbut had not got
out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre
by fasting and seeing of spirits </s>
<s>  among these accordingly much
discoursing with spirits went onand it did a world of good which never
became manifest </s>
<s> 

but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of
monseigneur were perfectly dressed </s>
<s>  if the day of judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally
correct </s>
<s>  such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant
swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would
surely keep anything going for ever and ever </s>
<s>  the exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved </s>
<s>  these golden fetters rang like precious little bells </s>
<s> 
and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and
his devouring hunger far away </s>
<s> 

dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places </s>
<s>  everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that
was never to leave off </s>
<s>  from the palace of the tuileries through
monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals
of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball
descended to the common executioner </s>
<s>  who in pursuance of the charm was
required to officiate frizzled powdered in a goldlaced coat pumps
and white silk stockings </s>
<s>  at the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a
raritymonsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call
him presided in this dainty dress </s>
<s>  and who among the company at
monseigneurs reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman powdered goldlaced pumped and whitesilk stockinged would
see the very stars out </s>
<s> 

monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown
open and issued forth </s>
<s>  then what submission what cringing and
fawning what servility what abject humiliation </s>
<s>  as to bowing down in
body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heavenwhich may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never
troubled it </s>
<s> 

bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of
truth </s>
<s>  there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites and was seen no more </s>
<s> 

the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs </s>
<s>  there was soon
but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm
and his snuffbox in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out </s>
<s> 

i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil </s>
<s> 

with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs </s>
<s> 

he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and
with a face like a fine mask </s>
<s>  a face of a transparent paleness </s>
<s>  every
feature in it clearly defined </s>
<s>  one set expression on it </s>
<s>  the nose
beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril </s>
<s>  in those two compressions or dints the only little
change that the face ever showed resided </s>
<s>  they persisted in changing
colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation </s>
<s>  then they gave a look of
treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance </s>
<s>  examined with
attention its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of the eyes being much
too horizontal and thin </s>
<s>  still in the effect of the face made it was a
handsome face and a remarkable one </s>
<s> 

its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and
drove away </s>
<s>  not many people had talked with him at the reception </s>
<s>  he had
stood in a little space apart and monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner </s>
<s>  it appeared under the circumstances rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses and
often barely escaping from being run down </s>
<s>  his man drove as if he were
charging an enemy and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face or to the lips of the master </s>
<s>  the complaint had
sometimes made itself audible even in that deaf city and dumb age
that in the narrow streets without footways the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner </s>
<s>  but few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time and in this matter as in all others the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could </s>
<s> 

with a wild rattle and clatter and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners with women screaming
before it and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way </s>
<s>  at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices and the horses reared and plunged </s>
<s> 

but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would not have
stopped </s>
<s>  carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded
behind and why not </s>
<s>  but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry
and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles </s>
<s> 

what has gone wrong </s>
<s>  said monsieur calmly looking out </s>
<s> 

a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountain and was
down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal </s>
<s> 

pardon monsieur the marquis </s>
<s>  said a ragged and submissive man it is
a child </s>
<s> 

why does he make that abominable noise </s>
<s>  is it his child </s>
<s> 

excuse me monsieur the marquisit is a pityyes </s>
<s> 

the fountain was a little removed </s>
<s>  for the street opened where it was
into a space some ten or twelve yards square </s>
<s>  as the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground and came running at the carriage monsieur the
marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his swordhilt </s>
<s> 

killed </s>
<s>  shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both arms at
their length above his head and staring at him </s>
<s>  dead </s>
<s> 

the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis </s>
<s>  there was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness </s>
<s>  there was no visible menacing or anger </s>
<s>  neither did the
people say anything </s>
<s>  after the first cry they had been silent and they
remained so </s>
<s>  the voice of the submissive man who had spoken was flat
and tame in its extreme submission </s>
<s>  monsieur the marquis ran his eyes
over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes </s>

<s> 

he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell </s>
<s>  the
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry dead </s>
<s> 

he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom the rest
made way </s>
<s>  on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder
sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it </s>

were as silent however as the men </s>

throwing him another gold coin and spend it as you will </s>
<s>  the horses
there </s>
<s>  are they right </s>
<s> 

without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time monsieur the
marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing and had
paid for it and could afford to pay for it </s>
<s>  when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor </s>

<s> 

he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood a
moment before </s>
<s>  but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman knitting </s>

<s>  said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchanged front
except as to the spots on his nose </s>
<s>  i would ride over any of you very
willingly and exterminate you from the earth </s>
<s>  if i knew which rascal
threw at the carriage and if that brigand were sufficiently near it he
should be crushed under the wheels </s>

so cowed was their condition and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them within the law and beyond it that not
a voice or a hand or even an eye was raised </s>
<s>  among the men not one </s>
<s> 
but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the
marquis in the face </s>
<s>  it was not for his dignity to notice it </s>
<s>  his
contemptuous eyes passed over her and over all the other rats </s>
<s>  and he
leaned back in his seat again and gave the word go on </s>

succession </s>

spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk and through

bidden himself away with it when the women who had tended the bundle

of the water and the rolling of the fancy ballwhen the one woman who
had stood conspicuous knitting still knitted on with the steadfastness
of fate </s>

with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur </s>

he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his
face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down </s>

himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow </s>
<s> 

what was he like </s>
<s> 

monseigneur he was whiter than the miller </s>
<s>  all covered with dust
white as a spectre tall as a spectre </s>
<s> 

the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd </s>
<s>  but all
eyes without comparing notes with other eyes looked at monsieur
the marquis </s>

conscience </s>
<s> 

truly you did well said the marquis felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him to see a thief accompanying my carriage
and not open that great mouth of yours </s>

monsieur gabelle was the postmaster and some other taxing functionary

examination and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner </s>

the accursed was already under the carriage with some halfdozen

halfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out and

monseigneur he precipitated himself over the hillside head first as
a person plunges into the river </s>
<s> 

see to it gabelle </s>

the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels like sheep </s>
<s>  the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones </s>
<s>  they had very little else to save or
they might not have been so fortunate </s>
<s> 

the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond was soon checked by the steepness of the hill </s>

it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night </s>

to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling </s>

it is you monseigneur </s>

she looked an old woman but was young </s>

monseigneur the good god knows </s>

monseigneur </s>
<s> 

the valet had put her away from the door the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left far
behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau </s>
<s> 

the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him and rose as
the rain falls impartially on the dusty ragged and toilworn group
at the fountain not far away </s>
<s>  to whom the mender of roads with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre as long as they could bear it </s>

in little casements </s>

stars came out seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished </s>
<s> 

the shadow of a large highroofed house and of many overhanging trees
was upon monsieur the marquis by that time </s>

for the light of a flambeau as his carriage stopped and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him </s>

ix </s>
<s>  the gorgons head


it was a heavy mass of building that chateau of monsieur the marquis
with a large stone courtyard before it and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door </s>
<s>  a stony
business altogether with heavy stone balustrades and stone urns and
stone flowers and stone faces of men and stone heads of lions in
all directions </s>
<s>  as if the gorgons head had surveyed it when it was
finished two centuries ago </s>
<s> 

up the broad flight of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeau
preceded went from his carriage sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees </s>
<s>  all else was so quiet that the
flambeau carried up the steps and the other flambeau held at the great
door burnt as if they were in a close room of state instead of being
in the open nightair </s>
<s>  other sound than the owls voice there was none
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin </s>
<s>  for it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together and then
heave a long low sigh and hold their breath again </s>
<s> 

the great door clanged behind him and monsieur the marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boarspears swords and knives of the chase </s>
<s> 
grimmer with certain heavy ridingrods and ridingwhips of which many a
peasant gone to his benefactor death had felt the weight when his lord
was angry </s>
<s> 

avoiding the larger rooms which were dark and made fast for the night
monsieur the marquis with his flambeaubearer going on before went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor </s>
<s>  this thrown open admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms </s>
<s>  his bedchamber and two
others </s>
<s>  high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country </s>
<s> 
the fashion of the last louis but one of the line that was never to
breakthe fourteenth louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture </s>
<s> 
but it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of france </s>
<s> 

a suppertable was laid for two in the third of the rooms </s>
<s>  a round
room in one of the chateaus four extinguishertopped towers </s>
<s>  a small
lofty room with its window wide open and the wooden jalousieblinds
closed so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black alternating with their broad lines of stone colour </s>
<s> 

my nephew said the marquis glancing at the supper preparation </s>
<s>  they
said he was not arrived </s>

nor was he </s>

<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  it is not probable he will arrive tonight </s>
<s>  nevertheless leave the
table as it is </s>
<s>  i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour </s>
<s> 

in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper </s>
<s>  his chair was opposite to the window and
he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his
lips when he put it down </s>
<s> 

what is that </s>
<s>  he calmly asked looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour </s>
<s> 

monseigneur </s>

it was done </s>
<s> 

well </s>

monseigneur it is nothing </s>

the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked out into
the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind him looking round
for instructions </s>
<s> 

good said the imperturbable master </s>
<s>  close them again </s>
<s> 

that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper </s>
<s>  he was
half way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand
hearing the sound of wheels </s>
<s>  it came on briskly and came up to the
front of the chateau </s>
<s> 

ask who is arrived </s>
<s> 

it was the nephew of monseigneur </s>
<s>  he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur early in the afternoon </s>
<s>  he had diminished the distance
rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road </s>
<s> 
he had heard of monseigneur at the postinghouses as being before him </s>
<s> 

he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and
there and that he was prayed to come to it </s>
<s>  in a little while he came </s>
<s> 
he had been known in england as charles darnay </s>
<s> 

monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shake
hands </s>
<s> 

you left paris yesterday sir </s>
<s>  he said to monseigneur as he took his
seat at table </s>
<s> 

yesterday </s>
<s>  and you </s>
<s> 

i come direct </s>
<s> 

from london </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

you have been a long time coming said the marquis with a smile </s>
<s> 

on the contrary </s>
<s>  i come direct </s>
<s> 

pardon me </s>
<s>  i mean not a long time on the journey </s>
<s>  a long time
intending the journey </s>
<s> 

i have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his
answervarious business </s>
<s> 

without doubt said the polished uncle </s>
<s> 

so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them </s>
<s> 
when coffee had been served and they were alone together the nephew
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask opened a conversation </s>
<s> 

i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that
took me away </s>
<s>  it carried me into great and unexpected peril </s>
<s>  but it is
a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have
sustained me </s>
<s> 

not to death said the uncle </s>
<s>  it is not necessary to say to death </s>
<s> 

i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there </s>
<s> 

the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that </s>
<s>  the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring </s>
<s> 

indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me </s>
<s> 

no no no said the uncle pleasantly </s>
<s> 

but however that may be resumed the nephew glancing at him with
deep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means
and would know no scruple as to means </s>
<s> 

my friend i told you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation in the
two marks </s>
<s>  do me the favour to recall that i told you so long ago </s>
<s> 

i recall it </s>
<s> 

thank you said the marquisvery sweetly indeed </s>
<s> 

his tone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musical
instrument </s>
<s> 

in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to be at once your
bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in
france here </s>
<s> 

i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffee </s>
<s> 
dare i ask you to explain </s>
<s> 

i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely </s>
<s> 

it is possible said the uncle with great calmness </s>
<s>  for the honour
of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent </s>
<s> 
pray excuse me </s>
<s> 

i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before
yesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew </s>
<s> 

i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle with refined
politeness </s>
<s>  i would not be sure of that </s>
<s>  a good opportunity for
consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself </s>
<s>  but it is useless to discuss the question </s>
<s>  i am as you say
at a disadvantage </s>
<s>  these little instruments of correction these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that
might so incommode you are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity </s>
<s>  they are sought by so many and they are granted
comparatively to so few </s>
<s>  it used not to be so but france in all such
things is changed for the worse </s>
<s>  our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar </s>
<s>  from this room many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged </s>
<s>  in the next room my bedroom
one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter </s>
<s>  we have
lost many privileges </s>
<s>  a new philosophy has become the mode </s>
<s>  and the
assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as
to say would but might cause us real inconvenience </s>
<s>  all very bad very
bad </s>
<s> 

the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his head </s>
<s> 
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself that great means of regeneration </s>
<s> 

we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern
time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our name to be
more detested than any name in france </s>
<s> 

let us hope so said the uncle </s>
<s>  detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low </s>
<s> 

there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face i can
look at in all this country round about us which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery </s>
<s> 

a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the family
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur </s>
<s> 
hah </s>
<s>  and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff and lightly
crossed his legs </s>
<s> 

but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness closeness
and dislike than was comportable with its wearers assumption of
indifference </s>
<s> 

repression is the only lasting philosophy </s>
<s>  the dark deference of fear
and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to it shuts
out the sky </s>
<s> 

that might not be so long as the marquis supposed </s>
<s>  if a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence could have been shown to
him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly firecharred plunderwrecked rains </s>
<s>  as for the roof
he vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new
wayto wit for ever from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets </s>
<s> 

meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour and repose
of the family if you will not </s>
<s>  but you must be fatigued </s>
<s>  shall we
terminate our conference for the night </s>
<s> 

a moment more </s>
<s> 

an hour if you please </s>
<s> 

sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits
of wrong </s>
<s> 

we have done wrong </s>
<s>  repeated the marquis with an inquiring smile
and delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself </s>
<s> 

our family </s>
<s>  our honourable family whose honour is of so much account
to both of us in such different ways </s>
<s>  even in my fathers time we did
a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure whatever it was </s>
<s>  why need i speak of my fathers time
when it is equally yours </s>
<s>  can i separate my fathers twinbrother joint
inheritor and next successor from himself </s>
<s> 

death has done that </s>
<s>  said the marquis </s>
<s> 

and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that is
frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it </s>
<s>  seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the last
look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to
redress </s>
<s>  and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain </s>
<s> 

seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him on the
breast with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou
will for ever seek them in vain be assured </s>
<s> 

every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was
cruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew with his snuffbox in his hand </s>
<s>  once again he
touched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword with which in delicate finesse he ran him through the
body and said

my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have
lived </s>
<s> 

when he had said it he took a culminating pinch of snuff and put his
box in his pocket </s>
<s> 

better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing a small
bell on the table and accept your natural destiny </s>
<s>  but you are lost
monsieur charles i see </s>
<s> 

this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadly </s>
<s>  i
renounce them </s>
<s> 

are they both yours to renounce </s>
<s>  france may be but is the property </s>
<s>  it
is scarcely worth mentioning </s>
<s>  but is it yet </s>
<s> 

i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet </s>
<s>  if it passed
to me from you tomorrow

which i have the vanity to hope is not probable </s>
<s> 

or twenty years hence

you do me too much honour said the marquis </s>
<s>  still i prefer that
supposition </s>
<s> 

i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere </s>
<s>  it is little to
relinquish </s>
<s>  what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room </s>
<s> 

to the eye it is fair enough here </s>
<s>  but seen in its integrity
under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste
mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hunger nakedness
and suffering </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said the marquis again in a wellsatisfied manner </s>
<s> 

if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the
weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in
another generation suffer less </s>
<s>  but it is not for me </s>
<s>  there is a curse
on it and on all this land </s>
<s> 

and you </s>
<s>  said the uncle </s>
<s>  forgive my curiosity </s>
<s>  do you under your new
philosophy graciously intend to live </s>
<s> 

i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at
their backs may have to do some daywork </s>
<s> 

in england for example </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  the family honour sir is safe from me in this country </s>
<s>  the
family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other </s>
<s> 

the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to be
lighted </s>
<s>  it now shone brightly through the door of communication </s>
<s>  the
marquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of his
valet </s>
<s> 

england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there he observed then turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile </s>
<s> 

i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may
be indebted to you sir </s>
<s>  for the rest it is my refuge </s>
<s> 

they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of many </s>
<s>  you
know a compatriot who has found a refuge there </s>
<s>  a doctor </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

with a daughter </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

yes said the marquis </s>
<s>  you are fatigued </s>
<s>  good night </s>
<s> 

as he bent his head in his most courtly manner there was a secrecy
in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly </s>
<s>  at the same
time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes and the thin
straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic </s>
<s> 

yes repeated the marquis </s>
<s>  a doctor with a daughter </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  so
commences the new philosophy </s>
<s>  you are fatigued </s>
<s>  good night </s>
<s> 

it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his </s>
<s>  the nephew
looked at him in vain in passing on to the door </s>
<s> 

good night </s>
<s>  said the uncle </s>
<s>  i look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning </s>
<s>  good repose </s>
<s>  light monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there </s>
<s> and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will he
added to himself before he rang his little bell again and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom </s>
<s> 

the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamberrobe to prepare himself gently for sleep that hot still
night </s>
<s>  rustling about the room his softlyslippered feet making no
noise on the floor he moved like a refined tiger </s>
<s> looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort in story whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off or just
coming on </s>
<s> 

he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again at the
scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind </s>
<s>  the slow
toil up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent the mill the
prison on the crag the little village in the hollow the peasants at
the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage </s>
<s>  that fountain suggested the paris fountain
the little bundle lying on the step the women bending over it and the
tall man with his arms up crying dead </s>
<s> 

i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may go to bed </s>
<s> 

so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep </s>
<s> 

the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours </s>
<s>  for three heavy hours the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by menpoets </s>
<s>  but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them </s>
<s> 

for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion and human
stared blindly at the night </s>
<s>  dead darkness lay on all the landscape
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads </s>
<s> 
the burialplace had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another </s>
<s>  the figure on the cross might
have come down for anything that could be seen of it </s>
<s>  in the village
taxers and taxed were fast asleep </s>
<s>  dreaming perhaps of banquets as
the starved usually do and of ease and rest as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may its lean inhabitants slept soundly and were fed and
freed </s>
<s> 

the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheardboth melting away like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of timethrough three dark
hours </s>
<s>  then the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened </s>
<s> 

lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees and poured its radiance over the hill </s>
<s>  in the glow the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stone faces
crimsoned </s>
<s>  the carol of the birds was loud and high and on the
weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieur
the marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might </s>
<s> 
at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed and with open
mouth and dropped underjaw looked awestricken </s>
<s> 

now the sun was full up and movement began in the village </s>
<s>  casement
windows opened crazy doors were unbarred and people came forth
shiveringchilled as yet by the new sweet air </s>
<s>  then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population </s>
<s>  some to the
fountain </s>
<s>  some to the fields </s>
<s>  men and women here to dig and delve </s>
<s>  men
and women there to see to the poor live stock and lead the bony cows
out to such pasture as could be found by the roadside </s>
<s>  in the church
and at the cross a kneeling figure or two </s>
<s>  attendant on the latter

foot </s>
<s> 

the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awoke gradually and
surely </s>
<s>  first the lonely boarspears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old </s>
<s>  then had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine </s>
<s> 
now doors and windows were thrown open horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways leaves sparkled and rustled at irongrated windows dogs
pulled hard at their chains and reared impatient to be loosed </s>

chateau nor the running up and down the stairs </s>

figures on the terrace </s>
<s>  nor the booting and tramping here and there and

at work on the hilltop beyond the village with his days dinner not

peck at on a heap of stones </s>
<s>  had the birds carrying some grains of it

the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have ˜em out and to pull ˜em out mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop </s>
<s>  on the crowds opening the coach
doors the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
for a moment </s>

that in another moment he was scouring away up a byestreet after
shedding his cloak hat long hatband white pockethandkerchief and
other symbolical tears </s>

these the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops </s>
<s>  for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded </s>
<s> 
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing </s>
<s>  practical suggestions being
much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it </s>
<s>  among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tellsons in the further corner of the mourning
coach </s>
<s> 

the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies </s>
<s>  but the river being alarmingly near and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief </s>
<s> 
the remodelled procession started with a chimneysweep driving the
hearseadvised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under
close inspection for the purposeand with a pieman also attended
by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach </s>
<s>  a bearleader a
popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional
ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand </s>
<s>  and his
bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked </s>
<s> 

thus with beerdrinking pipesmoking songroaring and infinite
caricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting
at every step and all the shops shutting up before it </s>
<s>  its destination
was the old church of saint pancras far off in the fields </s>

in course of time </s>
<s>  insisted on pouring into the burialground </s>
<s>  finally
accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way and
highly to its own satisfaction </s>
<s> 

the dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter
genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passersby as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them </s>
<s>  chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated </s>
<s>  the transition to the sport of
windowbreaking and thence to the plundering of publichouses was easy
and natural </s>
<s>  at last after several hours when sundry summerhouses had
been pulled down and some arearailings had been torn up to arm
the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the guards were
coming </s>

the guards came and perhaps they never came and this was the usual
progress of a mob </s>

mr </s>

behind in the churchyard to confer and condole with the undertakers </s>

the place had a soothing influence on him </s>

neighbouring publichouse and smoked it looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot </s>

jerry said <abvr> cruncher apostrophising himself in his usual way

himself about that he might appear before the hour of closing on his

young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest and reported no
job in his absence </s>

ironical dissatisfaction </s>

breadandbutter and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer </s>

<s> 

he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on <abvr> cruncher and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage </s>
<s>  with this view he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections </s>
<s>  the devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife </s>

professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story </s>

yourn aint he </s>
<s>  hes as thin as a lath </s>
<s>  do you call yourself a mother
and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boy out </s>
<s> 

this touched young jerry on a tender place </s>
<s>  who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglected above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent </s>
<s> 

thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family until young jerry
was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similar injunctions
obeyed them </s>
<s>  <abvr> cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
oclock </s>
<s>  towards that small and ghostly hour he rose up from his chair
took a key out of his pocket opened a locked cupboard and brought
forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other
fishing tackle of that nature </s>
<s>  disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on <abvr> cruncher
extinguished the light and went out </s>
<s> 

young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed was not long after his father </s>
<s>  under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the
court followed out into the streets </s>
<s>  he was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the
door stood ajar all night </s>
<s> 

impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to house fronts
walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his
honoured parent in view </s>
<s>  the honoured parent steering northward had not
gone far when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton and
the two trudged on together </s>
<s> 

within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the
winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a
lonely road </s>
<s>  another fisherman was picked up hereand that so silently
that if young jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split
himself into two </s>
<s> 

the three went on and young jerry went on until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road </s>
<s>  upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall surmounted by an iron railing </s>
<s>  in the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which
the wallthere risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one side </s>
<s> 
crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that
young jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an iron gate </s>
<s> 
he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the
third </s>
<s>  they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay
there a littlelistening perhaps </s>
<s>  then they moved away on their hands
and knees </s>
<s> 

it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate </s>
<s>  which he did
holding his breath </s>
<s>  crouching down again in a corner there and looking
in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass </s>
<s> 
and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large churchyard
that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant </s>
<s>  they did not
creep far before they stopped and stood upright </s>
<s>  and then they began to
fish </s>
<s> 

they fished with a spade at first </s>
<s>  presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew </s>
<s> 
whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off
with his hair as stiff as his fathers </s>
<s> 

but his longcherished desire to know more about these matters not
only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again </s>
<s>  they
were still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time </s>
<s>  but now they seemed to have got a bite </s>
<s>  there was a
screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were
strained as if by a weight </s>
<s>  by slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it and came to the surface </s>
<s>  young jerry very well knew what
it would be </s>
<s>  but when he saw it and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open he was so frightened being new to the sight that he
made off again and never stopped until he had run a mile or more </s>
<s> 

he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran and one highly desirable
to get to the end of </s>
<s>  he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him </s>
<s>  and pictured as hopping on behind him bolt
upright upon its narrow end always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to
shun </s>
<s>  it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too for while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boys kite without tail and wings </s>
<s>  it hid in doorways
too rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them up
to its ears as if it were laughing </s>
<s>  it got into shadows on the road
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up </s>
<s>  all this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead </s>
<s>  and even then
it would not leave him but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair scrambled into bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on
his breast when he fell asleep </s>
<s> 

from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father in the
family room </s>
<s>  something had gone wrong with him </s>
<s>  at least so young jerry
inferred from the circumstance of his holding <abvr> cruncher by the
ears and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of the
bed </s>
<s> 

i told you i would said <abvr> cruncher and i did </s>
<s> 

jerry jerry jerry </s>
<s>  his wife implored </s>
<s> 

you oppose yourself to the profit of the business said jerry and me
and my partners suffer </s>
<s>  you was to honour and obey </s>
<s>  why the devil dont
you </s>
<s> 

i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested with tears </s>
<s> 

is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business </s>
<s>  is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business </s>
<s>  is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business </s>
<s> 

you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry </s>
<s> 

its enough for you retorted <abvr> cruncher to be the wife of a
honest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didnt </s>
<s>  a honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether </s>
<s>  call yourself a religious
woman </s>
<s>  if youre a religious woman give me a irreligious one </s>
<s>  you have
no more natral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has
of a pile and similarly it must be knocked into you </s>
<s> 

the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminated in
the honest tradesmans kicking off his claysoiled boots and lying down
at his length on the floor </s>
<s>  after taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay
down too and fell asleep again </s>
<s> 

there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else </s>
<s>  <abvr>
cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an iron potlid
by him as a projectile for the correction of <abvr> cruncher in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace </s>
<s>  he was brushed
and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling </s>
<s> 

young jerry walking with the stool under his arm at his fathers side
along sunny and crowded fleetstreet was a very different young jerry
from him of the previous night running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer </s>
<s>  his cunning was fresh with the day
and his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in fleetstreet and the city of london
that fine morning </s>
<s> 

father said young jerry as they walked along </s>
<s>  taking care to keep
at arms length and to have the stool well between them </s>
<s>  whats a

hat to give his spikes free play hes a tradesman </s>

his goods said <abvr> cruncher after turning it over in his mind is a
branch of scientific goods </s>

<s> 

i believe it is something of that sort said <abvr> cruncher </s>

oh father i should so like to be a resurrectionman when im quite
growed up </s>

mr </s>

<s> 
it depends upon how you dewelop your talents </s>
<s>  be careful to dewelop
your talents and never to say no more than you can help to nobody and
theres no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for </s>
<s>  as young jerry thus encouraged went on a few yards in advance
to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar <abvr> cruncher added to
himself </s>

yet be a blessing to you and a recompense to you for his mother </s>

early drinking at the wineshop of monsieur defarge </s>

again </s>

water </s>

the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling

the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other

after a gloomy silence the first jacques said good </s>

door </s>
<s> 

very willingly said the mender of roads </s>
<s>  whom defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned </s>
<s> 

the three had risen and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret </s>
<s> 

how say you jacques </s>

<s> 

to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge </s>
<s> 

magnificent </s>

the chateau and all the race returned defarge </s>

<s> 

the hungry man repeated in a rapturous croak magnificent </s>
<s>  and began
gnawing another finger </s>
<s> 

are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register </s>
<s>  without doubt it is
safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it </s>
<s>  but shall we always
be able to decipher itor i ought to say will she </s>
<s> 

jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would not lose
a word of itnot a syllable of it </s>
<s>  knitted in her own stitches and her
own symbols it will always be as plain to her as the sun </s>
<s>  confide in
madame defarge </s>
<s>  it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives
to erase himself from existence than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge </s>
<s> 

there was a murmur of confidence and approval and then the man who
hungered asked </s>
<s>  is this rustic to be sent back soon </s>
<s>  i hope so </s>
<s>  he is
very simple </s>
<s>  is he not a little dangerous </s>
<s> 

he knows nothing said defarge </s>
<s>  at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height </s>
<s>  i charge myself
with him </s>
<s>  let him remain with me </s>
<s>  i will take care of him and set him
on his road </s>
<s>  he wishes to see the fine worldthe king the queen and
court </s>
<s>  let him see them on sunday </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  exclaimed the hungry man staring </s>
<s>  is it a good sign that he
wishes to see royalty and nobility </s>
<s> 

jacques said defarge </s>
<s>  judiciously show a cat milk if you wish her
to thirst for it </s>
<s>  judiciously show a dog his natural prey if you wish
him to bring it down one day </s>
<s> 

nothing more was said and the mender of roads being found already
dozing on the topmost stair was advised to lay himself down on the
palletbed and take some rest </s>
<s>  he needed no persuasion and was soon
asleep </s>
<s> 

worse quarters than defarges wineshop could easily have been found
in paris for a provincial slave of that degree </s>
<s>  saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted his life was very
new and agreeable </s>
<s>  but madame sat all day at her counter so expressly
unconscious of him and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her </s>
<s>  for he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next </s>
<s>  and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out </s>
<s> 

therefore when sunday came the mender of roads was not enchanted
though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to versailles </s>
<s>  it was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there in a public conveyance </s>
<s>  it was
additionally disconcerting yet to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the king and queen </s>
<s> 

you work hard madame said a man near her </s>
<s> 

yes answered madame defarge </s>
<s>  i have a good deal to do </s>
<s> 

what do you make madame </s>
<s> 

many things </s>
<s> 

for instance

for instance returned madame defarge composedly shrouds </s>
<s> 

the man moved a little further away as soon as he could and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap </s>
<s>  feeling it mightily close
and oppressive </s>
<s>  if he needed a king and queen to restore him he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand </s>
<s>  for soon the largefaced king
and the fairfaced queen came in their golden coach attended by the
shining bulls eye of their court a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords </s>
<s>  and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes the mender of roads bathed himself so much to his temporary
intoxication that he cried long live the king long live the queen
long live everybody and everything </s>
<s>  as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous jacques in his time </s>
<s>  then there were gardens courtyards
terraces fountains green banks more king and queen more bulls eye
more lords and ladies more long live they all </s>
<s>  until he absolutely wept
with sentiment </s>
<s>  during the whole of this scene which lasted some three
hours he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company
and throughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces </s>
<s> 

bravo </s>
<s>  said defarge clapping him on the back when it was over like a
patron </s>
<s>  you are a good boy </s>
<s> 

the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations </s>
<s>  but no </s>
<s> 

you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear </s>
<s>  you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever </s>
<s>  then they are the more
insolent and it is the nearer ended </s>
<s> 

hey </s>
<s>  cried the mender of roads reflectively </s>
<s>  thats true </s>
<s> 

these fools know nothing </s>
<s>  while they despise your breath and would
stop it for ever and ever in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs they only know what your breath
tells them </s>
<s>  let it deceive them then a little longer </s>
<s>  it cannot
deceive them too much </s>
<s> 

madame defarge looked superciliously at the client and nodded in
confirmation </s>
<s> 

as to you said she you would shout and shed tears for anything if
it made a show and a noise </s>
<s>  say </s>
<s>  would you not </s>
<s> 

truly madame i think so </s>
<s>  for the moment </s>
<s> 

if you were shown a great heap of dolls and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage you would
pick out the richest and gayest </s>

truly yes madame </s>

yes </s>

set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers </s>

it is true madame </s>

you have seen both dolls and birds today said madame defarge with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent </s>

now go home </s>

madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to
the whispering trees </s>
<s>  such ample leisure had the stone faces now
for listening to the trees and to the fountain that the few village

the expression of the faces was altered </s>

villagehad a faint and bare existence there as its people hadthat

faces of anger and pain </s>

look of being avenged which they would henceforth bear for ever </s>

stone face over the great window of the bedchamber where the murder
was done two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose which
everybody recognised and which nobody had seen of old </s>
<s>  and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute before they all

they turned into the wineshop which was closed for it was midnight

the small moneys that had been taken during her absence examined the
stock went through the entries in the book made other entries of
her own checked the serving man in every possible way and finally
dismissed him to bed </s>

of money for the second time and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief in a chain of separate knots for safe keeping through the
night </s>

walked up and down through life </s>

little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains

manner and observing that it was time to go to bed </s>

next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wineshop knitting away assiduously </s>

now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction of her

and heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame fell
dead at the bottom </s>

themselves were elephants or something as far removed until they met

thought as much at court that sunny summer day </s>

rose in her headdress before she looked at the figure </s>

as the keeper of the wineshop entered at the door the spy saluted
him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smile good day
jacques </s>

<s> 

good day jacques </s>

confidence or quite so easy a smile under the stare </s>

you deceive yourself monsieur returned the keeper of the wineshop </s>

you mistake me for another </s>

it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited too </s>
<s>  good

good day </s>

<s> 

i was saying to madame with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered that they tell me there isand no wonder </s>
<s> much sympathy
and anger in saint antoine touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard </s>
<s> 

no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head </s>
<s>  i know nothing
of it </s>
<s> 

having said it he passed behind the little counter and stood with his
hand on the back of his wifes chair looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction </s>
<s> 

the spy well used to his business did not change his unconscious
attitude but drained his little glass of cognac took a sip of fresh
water and asked for another glass of cognac </s>
<s>  madame defarge poured it
out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a little song over
it </s>
<s> 

you seem to know this quarter well </s>

 observed defarge </s>
<s> 

not at all but i hope to know it better </s>
<s>  i am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  muttered defarge </s>
<s> 

the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls to me
 pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s>  said defarge with much indifference </s>
<s> 

yes indeed </s>
<s>  when doctor manette was released you his old domestic
had the charge of him i know </s>

<s>  you see i am
informed of the circumstances </s>
<s> 

such is the fact certainly said defarge </s>
<s>  he had had it conveyed
to him in an accidental touch of his wifes elbow as she knitted and
warbled that he would do best to answer but always with brevity </s>
<s> 

it was to you said the spy that his daughter came </s>
<s>  and it was
from your care that his daughter took him accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur </s>
<s>  how is he called </s>
<s> in a little wiglorryof the bank of
tellson and companyover to england </s>
<s> 

such is the fact repeated defarge </s>
<s> 

very interesting remembrances </s>
<s>  said the spy </s>
<s>  i have known doctor
manette and his daughter in england </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said defarge </s>
<s> 

you dont hear much about them now </s>
<s>  said the spy </s>
<s> 

no said defarge </s>
<s> 

in effect madame struck in looking up from her work and her little
song we never hear about them </s>
<s>  we received the news of their safe
arrival and perhaps another letter or perhaps two </s>
<s>  but since then
they have gradually taken their road in lifewe oursand we have held
no correspondence </s>
<s> 

perfectly so madame replied the spy </s>
<s>  she is going to be married </s>
<s> 

going </s>
<s>  echoed madame </s>
<s>  she was pretty enough to have been married long
ago </s>
<s>  you english are cold it seems to me </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  you know i am english </s>
<s> 

i perceive your tongue is returned madame </s>
<s>  and what the tongue is i
suppose the man is </s>
<s> 

he did not take the identification as a compliment </s>
<s>  but he made the best
of it and turned it off with a laugh </s>
<s>  after sipping his cognac to the
end he added </s>
<s> 

yes miss manette is going to be married </s>
<s>  but not to an englishman </s>
<s>  to
one who like herself is french by birth </s>
<s>  and speaking of gaspard ah
poor gaspard </s>
<s>  it was cruel cruel </s>
<s>  it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis for whom gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet </s>
<s>  in other words the present
marquis </s>
<s>  but he lives unknown in england he is no marquis there </s>

mr </s>

madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband </s>

as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe he was
troubled and his hand was not trustworthy </s>
<s>  the spy would have been no

having made at least this one hit whatever it might prove to be
worth and no customers coming in to help him to any other <abvr> barsad
paid for what he had drunk and took his leave </s>
<s>  taking occasion to say
in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again </s>
<s>  for some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them lest he should
come back </s>
<s> 

can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair </s>
<s>  what he has
said of maamselle manette </s>
<s> 

as he has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a little it
is probably false </s>

if it is defarge began and stopped </s>
<s> 

if it is </s>
<s>  repeated his wife </s>
<s> 

and if it does come while we live to see it triumphi hope for her

<s> 

her husbands destiny said madame defarge with her usual composure
will take him where he is to go and will lead him to the end that is
to end him </s>
<s>  that is all i know </s>
<s> 

but it is very strangenow at least is it not very strangesaid
defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it
that after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herself her
husbands name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment by
the side of that infernal dogs who has just left us </s>
<s> 

stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered
madame </s>
<s>  i have them both here of a certainty </s>

for their merits </s>

she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head </s>

either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone or saint antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance </s>

shortly afterwards and the wineshop recovered its habitual aspect </s>

in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turned
himself inside out and sat on doorsteps and windowledges and came

but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts </s>

defarge moved on from group to group all three went quicker and fiercer

behind </s>

her husband smoked at his door looking after her with admiration </s>

the women sat knitting knitting </s>

darkness was closing in as surely when the church bells then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france should be melted into

xvii </s>
<s>  one night


never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
soho than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat
under the planetree together </s>
<s>  never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great london than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree and shone upon their faces through its leaves </s>
<s> 

lucie was to be married tomorrow </s>

for her father and they sat alone under the planetree </s>
<s> 

you are happy my dear father </s>

they had said little though they had been there a long time </s>

was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work nor had she read to him </s>

and i am very happy tonight dear father </s>
<s>  i am deeply happy in the
love that heaven has so blessedmy love for charles and charless love
for me </s>
<s>  but if my life were not to be still consecrated to you or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us even by
the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappy and
selfreproachful now than i can tell you </s>
<s>  even as it is

even as it was she could not command her voice </s>
<s> 

in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face
upon his breast </s>
<s>  in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of
the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and
its going </s>
<s> 

dearest dear </s>
<s>  can you tell me this last time that you feel quite
quite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine will
ever interpose between us </s>
<s>  i know it well but do you know it </s>
<s>  in your
own heart do you feel quite certain </s>
<s> 

her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed quite sure my darling </s>
<s>  more than that he
added as he tenderly kissed her </s>
<s>  my future is far brighter lucie
seen through your marriage than it could have beennay than it ever
waswithout it </s>
<s> 

if i could hope that my father </s>
<s> 

believe it love </s>
<s>  indeed it is so </s>
<s>  consider how natural and how plain
it is my dear that it should be so </s>
<s>  you devoted and young cannot

wasted

she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his and repeated
the word </s>
<s> 

wasted my childshould not be wasted struck aside from the
natural order of thingsfor my sake </s>
<s>  your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this </s>
<s>  but only ask yourself
how could my happiness be perfect while yours was incomplete </s>
<s> 

if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quite happy
with you </s>
<s> 

he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without charles having seen him </s>
<s>  and replied </s>
<s> 

my child you did see him and it is charles </s>
<s>  if it had not been
charles it would have been another </s>
<s>  or if it had been no other i
should have been the cause and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you </s>
<s> 

it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering </s>
<s>  it gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears </s>
<s>  and she remembered it long
afterwards </s>
<s> 

see </s>
<s>  said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards the moon </s>
<s> 
i have looked at her from my prisonwindow when i could not bear her
light </s>
<s>  i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beaten my head against
my prisonwalls </s>
<s>  i have looked at her in a state so dull and lethargic
that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i
could draw across her at the full and the number of perpendicular lines
with which i could intersect them </s>
<s>  he added in his inward and pondering
manner as he looked at the moon it was twenty either way i remember
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in </s>
<s> 

the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time
deepened as he dwelt upon it </s>
<s>  but there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference </s>
<s>  he only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over </s>
<s> 

i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom i had been rent </s>
<s>  whether it was alive </s>
<s>  whether it had
been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it </s>
<s>  whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father </s>
<s>  there was a time in my
imprisonment when my desire for vengeance was unbearable </s>
<s>  whether it
was a son who would never know his fathers story </s>
<s>  who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own
will and act </s>
<s>  whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman </s>
<s> 

she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand </s>
<s> 

i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful of
merather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me </s>
<s>  i have
cast up the years of her age year after year </s>
<s>  i have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate </s>
<s>  i have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living and in the next generation my place was a
blank </s>
<s> 

my father </s>
<s>  even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child </s>
<s> 

you lucie </s>
<s>  it is out of the consolation and restoration you have
brought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and
the moon on this last night </s>
<s> what did i say just now </s>
<s> 

she knew nothing of you </s>
<s>  she cared nothing for you </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations couldi have imagined her as coming to me in my cell and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress </s>
<s>  i have seen her
image in the moonlight often as i now see you </s>
<s>  except that i never held
her in my arms </s>
<s>  it stood between the little grated window and the door </s>
<s> 
but you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of </s>
<s> 

the figure was not </s>
<s>  thetheimage </s>
<s>  the fancy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  that was another thing </s>
<s>  it stood before my disturbed sense of
sight but it never moved </s>
<s>  the phantom that my mind pursued was another
and more real child </s>
<s>  of her outward appearance i know no more than
that she was like her mother </s>
<s>  the other had that likeness tooas you
havebut was not the same </s>
<s>  can you follow me lucie </s>
<s>  hardly i think </s>
<s> 
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions </s>
<s> 

his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition </s>
<s> 

in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlight
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father </s>
<s>  my picture
was in her room and i was in her prayers </s>
<s>  her life was active
cheerful useful </s>
<s>  but my poor history pervaded it all </s>
<s> 

i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my love
that was i </s>
<s> 

and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvais and
they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me </s>
<s>  when they passed
a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning walls and looked
up at its bars and spoke in whispers </s>
<s>  she could never deliver me </s>
<s>  i
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things </s>
<s> 
but then blessed with the relief of tears i fell upon my knees and
blessed her </s>
<s> 

i am that child i hope my father </s>
<s>  o my dear my dear will you bless
me as fervently tomorrow </s>
<s> 

lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have tonight
for loving you better than words can tell and thanking god for my great
happiness </s>
<s>  my thoughts when they were wildest never rose near the
happiness that i have known with you and that we have before us </s>
<s> 

he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him </s>
<s>  byandbye they went into the
house </s>
<s> 

there was no one bidden to the marriage but <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross </s>
<s>  the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence </s>
<s>  they had been able to extend it
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothing more </s>
<s> 

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper </s>
<s>  they were only
three at table and miss pross made the third </s>
<s>  he regretted that charles
was not there </s>
<s>  was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away </s>
<s>  and drank to him affectionately </s>
<s> 

so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and they separated </s>
<s> 
but in the stillness of the third hour of the morning lucie came
downstairs again and stole into his room </s>
<s>  not free from unshaped fears
beforehand </s>
<s> 

all things however were in their places </s>
<s>  all was quiet </s>
<s>  and he lay
asleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet </s>
<s>  she put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips to his </s>
<s> 
then leaned over him and looked at him </s>
<s> 

into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had worn </s>
<s>  but he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep </s>
<s>  a more remarkable face in its quiet
resolute and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep that night </s>
<s> 

she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be and as his
sorrows deserved </s>
<s>  then she withdrew her hand and kissed his lips once
more and went away </s>
<s>  so the sunrise came and the shadows of the leaves
of the planetree moved upon his face as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him </s>

<s>  to think that there

<s> 

not at all </s>
<s>  from miss pross </s>

<s>  now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly round

<s>  let me kiss my dear girl with an
oldfashioned bachelor blessing before somebody comes to claim his
own </s>

for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at the
wellremembered expression on the forehead and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which if such things be oldfashioned were as old as adam </s>

the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles
darnay </s>
<s>  he was so deadly palewhich had not been the case when they
went in togetherthat no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face </s>
<s> 
but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered except that to the
shrewd glance of <abvr> lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him like a cold
wind </s>
<s> 

he gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to the chariot
which <abvr> lorry had hired in honour of the day </s>
<s>  the rest followed in
another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange
eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married </s>
<s> 

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling
glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of <abvr> lorrys pockets </s>
<s>  they returned home to
breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the
door at parting </s>

it was a hard parting though it was not for long </s>

cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms take her charles </s>

and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was
gone </s>

preparations having been very simple and few the doctor <abvr> lorry
and miss pross were left quite alone </s>

the welcome shade of the cool old hall that <abvr> lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor </s>
<s>  as if the golden arm uplifted
there had struck him a poisoned blow </s>
<s> 

he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone </s>
<s>  but it was
the old scared lost look that troubled <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got upstairs <abvr> lorry was reminded of defarge the

he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat </s>

throat as it used to be when he did that work </s>

<s>  he looked up for an instant at
a time when he was requested to do so </s>
<s>  but no persuasion would extract
a word from him </s>
<s>  he worked and worked and worked in silence and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on
the air </s>
<s>  the only ray of hope that <abvr> lorry could discover was that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked </s>
<s>  in that there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind </s>
<s> 

two things at once impressed themselves on <abvr> lorry as important above
all others </s>
<s>  the first that this must be kept secret from lucie </s>
<s> 
the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him </s>
<s>  in
conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a
few days of complete rest </s>
<s>  in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been
called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post </s>
<s> 

these measures advisable to be taken in any case <abvr> lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself </s>
<s>  if that should happen soon he kept
another course in reserve </s>
<s>  which was to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best on the doctors case </s>
<s> 

in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable <abvr> lorry resolved to watch him
attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so </s>
<s>  he
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for the
first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same
room </s>
<s> 

he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him since on being pressed he became worried </s>
<s>  he abandoned that
attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen or was falling </s>
<s>  he remained therefore in his seat near the
window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place </s>
<s> 

doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on
that first day until it was too dark to seeworked on half an hour
after <abvr> lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write </s>
<s> 
when he put his tools aside as useless until morning <abvr> lorry rose
and said to him </s>
<s> 

will you go out </s>
<s> 

he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner
looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice </s>
<s> 

out </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a walk with me </s>
<s>  why not </s>
<s> 

he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more </s>
<s>  but <abvr>
lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in
some misty way asking himself why not </s>
<s>  the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it </s>
<s> 

miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room </s>
<s>  he paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down </s>
<s>  but when he did finally lay himself down he
fell asleep </s>
<s>  in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his
bench and to work </s>
<s> 

on this second day <abvr> lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them </s>
<s>  he
returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and
that he thought about it however confusedly </s>
<s>  this encouraged <abvr> lorry
to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day </s>
<s> 
at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then
present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing
amiss </s>
<s>  this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long
enough or often enough to harass him </s>
<s>  and it lightened <abvr> lorrys
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him </s>
<s> 

when it fell dark again <abvr> lorry asked him as before </s>
<s> 

dear doctor will you go out </s>
<s> 

as before he repeated out </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  for a walk with me </s>
<s>  why not </s>
<s> 

this time <abvr> lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned </s>
<s>  in the
meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had
sat there looking down at the planetree </s>
<s>  but on <abvr> lorrys return he
slipped away to his bench </s>
<s> 

the time went very slowly on and <abvr> lorrys hope darkened and his
heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day </s>
<s> 
the third day came and went the fourth the fifth </s>
<s>  five days six days
seven days eight days nine days </s>
<s> 

with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier <abvr> lorry passed through this anxious time </s>
<s>  the secret was
well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy </s>
<s>  but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first
was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on
his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in
the dusk of the ninth evening </s>
<s> 




xix </s>
<s>  an opinion


worn out by anxious watching <abvr> lorry fell asleep at his post </s>
<s>  on the
tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night </s>
<s> 

he rubbed his eyes and roused himself </s>
<s>  but he doubted when he had
done so whether he was not still asleep </s>
<s>  for going to the door of the
doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench
and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading
at the window </s>
<s>  he was in his usual morning dress and his face which
mr </s>
<s>  lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly
studious and attentive </s>
<s> 

even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake <abvr> lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own </s>
<s>  for did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed
as usual </s>
<s>  and was there any sign within their range that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened </s>
<s> 

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the
answer being obvious </s>
<s>  if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there </s>
<s> 
how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor
manettes consultingroom and to be debating these points outside the
doctors bedroom door in the early morning </s>
<s> 

within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side </s>
<s>  if he
had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have
resolved it </s>
<s>  but he was by that time clearheaded and had none </s>
<s> 
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfasthour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred </s>
<s>  if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind <abvr>
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain </s>
<s> 

miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked
out with care </s>
<s>  having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette <abvr> lorry presented himself at the breakfasthour in his usual
white linen and with his usual neat leg </s>
<s>  the doctor was summoned in the
usual way and came to breakfast </s>
<s> 

so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which <abvr> lorry felt to be the only safe
advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken
place yesterday </s>
<s>  an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to
the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and
counting and evidently made him uneasy </s>
<s>  in all other respects however
he was so composedly himself that <abvr> lorry determined to have the aid
he sought </s>
<s>  and that aid was his own </s>
<s> 

therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the
doctor were left together <abvr> lorry said feelingly </s>
<s> 

my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested </s>
<s>  that is to say it is
very curious to me </s>
<s>  perhaps to your better information it may be less
so </s>
<s> 

glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the
doctor looked troubled and listened attentively </s>
<s>  he had already glanced
at his hands more than once </s>
<s> 

doctor manette said <abvr> lorry touching him affectionately on the
arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine </s>
<s>  pray
give your mind to it and advise me well for his sakeand above all
for his daughtershis daughters my dear manette </s>
<s> 

if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental
shock </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

be explicit said the doctor </s>
<s>  spare no detail </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded </s>
<s> 

my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock
of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings
thetheas you express itthe mind </s>
<s>  the mind </s>
<s>  it is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how
long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there
are no other means of getting at it </s>
<s>  it is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace
himselfas i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner </s>
<s>  it is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to
be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and
great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge which was already very large </s>
<s>  but unfortunately
there has been he paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse </s>
<s> 

the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration </s>
<s> 

nine days and nights </s>
<s> 

how did it show itself </s>
<s>  i infer glancing at his hands again in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock </s>
<s> 

that is the fact </s>
<s> 

now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and
collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit
originally </s>
<s> 

once </s>
<s> 

and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respectsor in all
respectsas he was then </s>
<s> 

i think in all respects </s>
<s> 

you spoke of his daughter </s>
<s>  does his daughter know of the relapse </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her </s>
<s> 
it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted </s>
<s> 

the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind </s>
<s>  that was
very thoughtful </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of
the two spoke for a little while </s>
<s> 

now my dear manette said <abvr> lorry at length in his most
considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters </s>
<s>  i do not
possess the kind of information necessary </s>
<s>  i do not possess the kind of
intelligence </s>
<s>  i want guiding </s>
<s>  there is no man in this world on whom
i could so rely for right guidance as on you </s>
<s>  tell me how does this
relapse come about </s>
<s>  is there danger of another </s>
<s>  could a repetition of it
be prevented </s>
<s>  how should a repetition of it be treated </s>
<s>  how does it come
about at all </s>
<s>  what can i do for my friend </s>
<s>  no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine
if i knew how </s>
<s> 

but i dont know how to originate in such a case </s>
<s>  if your sagacity
knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be
able to do so much </s>
<s>  unenlightened and undirected i can do so little </s>
<s> 
pray discuss it with me </s>
<s>  pray enable me to see it a little more clearly
and teach me how to be a little more useful </s>
<s> 

doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and
mr </s>
<s>  lorry did not press him </s>
<s> 

i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort
that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite
unforeseen by its subject </s>
<s> 

was it dreaded by him </s>
<s>  <abvr> lorry ventured to ask </s>
<s> 

very much </s>
<s>  he said it with an involuntary shudder </s>
<s> 

you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers
mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him </s>
<s> 

would he asked <abvr> lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on
him </s>
<s> 

i think so </s>
<s>  but it is as i have told you next to impossible </s>
<s>  i even
believe itin some casesto be quite impossible </s>
<s> 

now said <abvr> lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors arm again
after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this
attack </s>
<s> 

i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady </s>
<s>  some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled i think </s>
<s>  it is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations
would be recalledsay under certain circumstancessay on a
particular occasion </s>
<s>  he tried to prepare himself in vain </s>
<s>  perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it </s>
<s> 

would he remember what took place in the relapse </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> lorry
with natural hesitation </s>
<s> 

the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and
answered in a low voice not at all </s>
<s> 

now as to the future hinted <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have
great hope </s>
<s>  as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i
should have great hope </s>
<s>  he yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that
the worst was over </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  thats good comfort </s>
<s>  i am thankful </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s> 

i am thankful </s>
<s>  repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence </s>
<s> 

there are two other points said <abvr> lorry on which i am anxious to
be instructed </s>
<s>  i may go on </s>
<s> 

you cannot do your friend a better service </s>
<s>  the doctor gave him his
hand </s>
<s> 

to the first then </s>
<s>  he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic </s>
<s> 
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things </s>
<s>  now does
he do too much </s>
<s> 

i think not </s>
<s>  it may be the character of his mind to be always in
singular need of occupation </s>
<s>  that may be in part natural to it </s>
<s>  in
part the result of affliction </s>
<s>  the less it was occupied with healthy
things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction </s>
<s>  he may have observed himself and made the discovery </s>
<s> 

you are sure that he is not under too great a strain </s>
<s> 

i think i am quite sure of it </s>
<s> 

my dear manette if he were overworked now

my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be </s>
<s>  there has been a
violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight </s>
<s> 

excuse me as a persistent man of business </s>
<s>  assuming for a moment
that he was overworked </s>
<s>  it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder </s>
<s> 

i do not think so </s>
<s>  i do not think said doctor manette with the
firmness of selfconviction that anything but the one train of
association would renew it </s>
<s>  i think that henceforth nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it </s>
<s>  after what has
happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again </s>
<s>  i trust and i almost
believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted </s>
<s> 

he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress </s>
<s>  it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence </s>
<s>  he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was and approached his second and last point </s>
<s>  he felt it to
be the most difficult of all </s>
<s>  but remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days he knew that he must face it </s>
<s> 

the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from said <abvr> lorry clearing his throat we
will callblacksmiths work blacksmiths work </s>
<s>  we will say to put a
case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad
time to work at a little forge </s>
<s>  we will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again </s>
<s>  is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him </s>
<s> 

the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot
nervously on the ground </s>
<s> 

he has always kept it by him said <abvr> lorry with an anxious look at
his friend </s>
<s>  now would it not be better that he should let it go </s>
<s> 

still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the
ground </s>
<s> 

you do not find it easy to advise me </s>
<s>  said <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  i quite
understand it to be a nice question </s>
<s>  and yet i think and there he
shook his head and stopped </s>
<s> 

you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause
it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings
of this poor mans mind </s>
<s>  he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation and it was so welcome when it came </s>
<s>  no doubt it relieved
his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more
practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental
torture </s>
<s>  that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach </s>
<s>  even now when i believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not
find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child </s>
<s> 

he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to <abvr> lorrys
face </s>
<s> 

but may notmind </s>
<s>  i ask for information as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and
banknotesmay not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea </s>
<s>  if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go
with it </s>
<s>  in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the
forge </s>
<s> 

there was another silence </s>
<s> 

you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old
companion </s>
<s> 

i would not keep it said <abvr> lorry shaking his head </s>
<s>  for he gained
in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted </s>
<s>  i would recommend him to
sacrifice it </s>
<s>  i only want your authority </s>
<s>  i am sure it does no good </s>
<s> 
come </s>
<s>  give me your authority like a dear good man </s>
<s>  for his daughters
sake my dear manette </s>
<s> 

very strange to see what a struggle there was within him </s>
<s> 

in her name then let it be done </s>
<s>  i sanction it </s>
<s>  but i would not take
it away while he was present </s>
<s>  let it be removed when he is not there </s>
<s> 
let him miss his old companion after an absence </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended </s>
<s>  they
passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored </s>
<s>  on the
three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband </s>
<s>  the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence <abvr> lorry had previously
explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and
she had no suspicions </s>
<s> 

on the night of the day on which he left the house <abvr> lorry went into
his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross
carrying a light </s>
<s>  there with closed doors and in a mysterious and
guilty manner <abvr> lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor
which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure </s>
<s>  the
burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire </s>
<s>  and the tools
shoes and leather were buried in the garden </s>
<s>  so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds that <abvr> lorry and miss pross
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible
crime </s>

they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away </s>

the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away

village was illuminating </s>

fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of

withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys </s>

the latent uneasiness in darnays mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter </s>
<s>  the peril of an old servant and a good one whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him so
reproachfully in the face that as he walked to and fro in the temple
considering what to do he almost hid his face from the passersby </s>
<s> 

he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold
he had acted imperfectly </s>
<s>  he knew very well that in his love for lucie
his renunciation of his social place though by no means new to his own
mind had been hurried and incomplete </s>
<s>  he knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it and that he had meant to
do it and that it had never been done </s>
<s> 

the happiness of his own chosen english home the necessity of being
always actively employed the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events of the week
following made all new again </s>
<s>  he knew very well that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded </s>
<s> not without disquiet but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance </s>
<s>  that he had watched
the times for a time of action and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by and the nobility were trooping from
france by every highway and byway and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction and their very names were blotting out
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
france that might impeach him for it </s>
<s> 

but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man </s>
<s>  he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he had
relinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it won his own private place there and earned his own
bread </s>
<s>  monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions to spare the people to give them what little
there was to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof for his
own safety so that it could not but appear now </s>
<s> 

this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make
that he would go to paris </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  like the mariner in the old story the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it was drawing him
to itself and he must go </s>
<s>  everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on faster and faster more and more steadily to the terrible
attraction </s>
<s>  his latent uneasiness had been that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they was not there
trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity </s>
<s>  with this uneasiness half stifled and half reproaching
him he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong </s>
<s>  upon that comparison
injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur
which had stung him bitterly and those of stryver which above all were
coarse and galling for old reasons </s>
<s>  upon those had followed gabelles
letter </s>
<s>  the appeal of an innocent prisoner in danger of death to his
justice honour and good name </s>
<s> 

his resolution was made </s>
<s>  he must go to paris </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  the loadstone rock was drawing him and he must sail on until he
struck </s>
<s>  he knew of no rock </s>
<s>  he saw hardly any danger </s>
<s>  the intention
with which he had done what he had done even although he had left
it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert
it </s>
<s>  then that glorious vision of doing good which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
revolution that was running so fearfully wild </s>
<s> 

as he walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered that
neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone </s>
<s> 
lucie should be spared the pain of separation </s>
<s>  and her father always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old
should come to the knowledge of the step as a step taken and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt </s>
<s>  how much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind he did not
discuss with himself </s>
<s>  but that circumstance too had had its influence
in his course </s>
<s> 

he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to
return to tellsons and take leave of <abvr> lorry </s>
<s>  as soon as he arrived
in paris he would present himself to this old friend but he must say
nothing of his intention now </s>

a carriage with posthorses was ready at the bank door and jerry was
booted and equipped </s>

and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank into the
misty air of fleetstreet </s>
<s>  my love to lucie and to little lucie said
mr </s>
<s>  lorry at parting and take precious care of them till i come back </s>
<s> 
 charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled as the carriage
rolled away </s>
<s> 

that nightit was the fourteenth of augusthe sat up late and wrote
two fervent letters </s>
<s>  one was to lucie explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to paris and showing her at length the reasons
that he had for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there </s>
<s>  the other was to the doctor confiding lucie and
their dear child to his care and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances </s>
<s>  to both he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety immediately after his arrival </s>
<s> 

it was a hard day that day of being among them with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind </s>
<s>  it was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious </s>
<s> 
but an affectionate glance at his wife so happy and busy made him
resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid and
the day passed quickly </s>
<s>  early in the evening he embraced her and her
scarcely less dear namesake pretending that he would return byandbye
an imaginary engagement took him out and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets with a heavier heart </s>
<s> 

the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself now and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it </s>

two letters with a trusty porter to be delivered half an hour before
midnight and no sooner </s>

republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or

a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished when charles
darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at paris </s>
<s>  whatever might befall now he must on to his journeys end </s>
<s> 
not a mean village closed upon him not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and england </s>
<s>  the universal
watchfulness so encompassed him that if he had been taken in a net
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone </s>
<s> 

this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in a day by
riding after him and taking him back riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation riding with him and keeping him in charge </s>
<s>  he had been
days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in
a little town on the high road still a long way from paris </s>
<s> 

nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelles letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far </s>
<s>  his difficulty at the
guardhouse in this small place had been such that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis </s>
<s>  and he was therefore as little surprised as
a man could be to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning in the middle of the night </s>
<s> 

awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on the bed </s>

<s>  as if it was

darnay complied and was taken back to the guardhouse where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleeping by
a watchfire </s>
<s>  here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he
started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning </s>
<s> 

the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured
cockades armed with national muskets and sabres who rode one on either
side of him </s>
<s> 

the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attached to
his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist </s>
<s>  in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces </s>
<s>  clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement
and out upon the miredeep roads </s>
<s>  in this state they traversed without
change except of horses and pace all the miredeep leagues that lay
between them and the capital </s>
<s> 

they travelled in the night halting an hour or two after daybreak and
lying by until the twilight fell </s>
<s>  the escort were so wretchedly clothed
that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off </s>
<s>  apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying
his musket very recklessly charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast </s>
<s>  for
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations
confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made </s>
<s> 

but when they came to the town of beauvaiswhich they did at eventide
when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming </s>
<s>  an ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard and many voices called
out loudly down with the emigrant </s>

he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle and
resuming it as his safest place said </s>

another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates </s>

struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned </s>

they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep </s>
<s>  among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep </s>

lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and
would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty or all drawn
up together singing a liberty song </s>
<s>  happily however there was sleep in
beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness </s>
<s>  jingling through the untimely cold and
wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their
way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads </s>
<s> 

daylight at last found them before the wall of paris </s>
<s>  the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it </s>
<s> 

where are the papers of this prisoner </s>
<s>  demanded a resolutelooking man
in authority who was summoned out by the guard </s>
<s> 

naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him and which he had paid for </s>
<s> 

where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him
whatever are the papers of this prisoner </s>
<s> 

the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them </s>
<s>  casting his
eyes over gabelles letter the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise and looked at darnay with a close attention </s>
<s> 

he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went
into the guardroom </s>
<s>  meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the
gate </s>
<s>  looking about him while in this state of suspense charles
darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots the latter far outnumbering the former </s>
<s>  and that while ingress
into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar
traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the homeliest
people was very difficult </s>
<s>  a numerous medley of men and women not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue
forth </s>
<s>  but the previous identification was so strict that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly </s>
<s>  some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered
about </s>
<s>  the red cap and tricolour cockade were universal both among men
and women </s>
<s> 

when he had sat in his saddle some halfhour taking note of these
things darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority
who directed the guard to open the barrier </s>
<s>  then he delivered to the
escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him
to dismount </s>

the gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the question merely

responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added for
the love of liberty </s>

the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it </s>

flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for </s>
<s> 

in secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paper </s>

he stuck the paper on a file in an illhumour and charles darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour </s>

through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behind them
until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded with
prisoners of both sexes </s>

utmost </s>

charles darnay roused himself and gave the required information in

there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voicesamong

him good wishes and encouragement </s>

render the thanks of his heart </s>

there were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress </s>

the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the four

a man who had been drowned and filled with water </s>

gone he thought in the same wandering way now am i left as if i were

<s>  there was one among
them the appearance of a lady dressed in black who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair and she looked like     let us ride on again for gods sake

<s>      he
made shoes he made shoes he made shoes </s>

opened not only the glass window but the lattice blind outside it and

from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came
the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring
in it weird and unearthly as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to heaven </s>

<s>  calm in storm


doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence </s>
<s>  so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her that
not until long afterwards when france and she were far apart did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace </s>
<s>  that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror </s>
<s>  and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain </s>
<s>  she only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of la force </s>
<s>  that in the prison he had
found a selfappointed tribunal sitting before which the prisoners were
brought singly and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred or to be released or in a few cases to be sent back
to their cells </s>
<s>  that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille </s>
<s>  that one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this
man was defarge </s>
<s> 

that hereupon he had ascertained through the registers on the table
that his soninlaw was among the living prisoners and had pleaded hard
to the tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake some
dirty with murder and some clean some sober and some notfor his life
and liberty </s>
<s>  that in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court and
examined </s>
<s>  that he seemed on the point of being at once released when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible
to the doctor which led to a few words of secret conference </s>
<s>  that
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody but should for his sake be held
inviolate in safe custody </s>
<s>  that immediately on a signal the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again </s>
<s>  but that he the
doctor had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his soninlaw was through no malice or mischance
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings that he had obtained the permission and
had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over </s>
<s> 

the sights he had seen there with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals shall remain untold </s>
<s>  the mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces </s>
<s>  one prisoner there was he said who had
been discharged into the street free but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out </s>
<s>  being besought to go to him and dress
the wound the doctor had passed out at the same gate and had found him
in the arms of a company of samaritans who were seated on the bodies
of their victims </s>
<s>  with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare they had helped the healer and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands and swooned away in the midst of it </s>
<s> 

as <abvr> lorry received these confidences and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixtytwo years of age a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger </s>
<s> 

but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect </s>
<s>  he had never
at all known him in his present character </s>
<s>  for the first time the doctor
felt now that his suffering was strength and power </s>

he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughters husband and deliver him </s>
<s> 
it all tended to a good end my friend </s>

<s>  and when jarvis lorry saw

of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped like a
clock for so many years and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed </s>
<s> 

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with would
have yielded before his persevering purpose </s>
<s>  while he kept himself
in his place as a physician whose business was with all degrees
of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good he used his
personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons and among them of la force </s>
<s>  he could now assure lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners </s>
<s>  he saw her husband weekly and brought sweet
messages to her straight from his lips </s>
<s>  sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her though never by the doctors hand but she was
not permitted to write to him </s>
<s>  for among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad </s>

this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubt </s>
<s>  still the
sagacious <abvr> lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it </s>
<s> 
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride </s>
<s>  it was a natural and worthy one </s>
<s> 
but he observed it as a curiosity </s>
<s>  the doctor knew that up to that
time his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness </s>
<s> 
now that this was changed and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charless
ultimate safety and deliverance he became so far exalted by the change
that he took the lead and direction and required them as the weak to
trust to him as the strong </s>
<s>  the preceding relative positions of himself

natural and right </s>

the north in fell and forest in the vineyards and the olivegrounds

the dread tribunal of five judges public prosecutor and determined

inside there </s>

<s> 

so at last began the evening paper at la force </s>
<s> 

when a name was called its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded </s>
<s>  charles
evremonde called darnay had reason to know the usage </s>
<s>  he had seen
hundreds pass away so </s>
<s> 

his bloated gaoler who wore spectacles to read with glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place and went through the
list making a similar short pause at each name </s>
<s>  there were twentythree
names but only twenty were responded to </s>
<s>  for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten </s>
<s>  the list was read in the vaulted chamber
where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival </s>
<s>  every one of those had perished in the massacre </s>
<s>  every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with had died on the
scaffold </s>
<s> 

there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was
soon over </s>
<s>  it was the incident of every day and the society of la force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert for that evening </s>
<s>  they crowded to the grates and shed tears
there </s>
<s>  but twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled and the time was at best short to the lockup hour when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night </s>
<s>  the prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling </s>
<s>  their ways arose out of the condition of the
time </s>
<s>  similarly though with a subtle difference a species of fervour
or intoxication known without doubt to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily and to die by it was not mere
boastfulness but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind </s>
<s>  in
seasons of pestilence some of us will have a secret attraction to the
diseasea terrible passing inclination to die of it </s>
<s>  and all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts only needing circumstances to evoke
them </s>
<s> 

the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark </s>
<s>  the night in its
verminhaunted cells was long and cold </s>
<s>  next day fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before charles darnays name was called </s>
<s>  all the fifteen
were condemned and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half </s>
<s> 

charles evremonde called darnay was at length arraigned </s>
<s> 

his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats </s>
<s>  but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the headdress otherwise prevailing </s>
<s>  looking
at the jury and the turbulent audience he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed and that the felons were trying the
honest men </s>
<s>  the lowest cruelest and worst populace of a city never
without its quantity of low cruel and bad were the directing
spirits of the scene </s>
<s>  noisily commenting applauding disapproving
anticipating and precipitating the result without a check </s>
<s>  of the men
the greater part were armed in various ways </s>
<s>  of the women some wore
knives some daggers some ate and drank as they looked on many
knitted </s>
<s>  among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked </s>
<s>  she was in a front row by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly
remembered as defarge </s>
<s>  he noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear and that she seemed to be his wife </s>
<s>  but what he most noticed
in the two figures was that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be they never looked towards him </s>
<s>  they seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination and they looked at
the jury but at nothing else </s>
<s>  under the president sat doctor manette
in his usual quiet dress </s>
<s>  as well as the prisoner could see he and <abvr>
lorry were the only men there unconnected with the tribunal who
wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
carmagnole </s>
<s> 

charles evremonde called darnay was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the republic under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of death </s>
<s>  it was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to france </s>
<s>  there he was and there was
the decree </s>
<s>  he had been taken in france and his head was demanded </s>
<s> 

take off his head </s>
<s>  cried the audience </s>
<s>  an enemy to the republic </s>
<s> 

the president rang his bell to silence those cries and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
england </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly it was </s>
<s> 

was he not an emigrant then </s>
<s>  what did he call himself </s>
<s> 

not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law </s>
<s> 

why not </s>
<s>  the president desired to know </s>
<s> 

because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left
his countryhe submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in useto live by his own industry in
england rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france </s>
<s> 

what proof had he of this </s>
<s> 

he handed in the names of two witnesses </s>
<s>  theophile gabelle and
alexandre manette </s>
<s> 

but he had married in england </s>
<s>  the president reminded him </s>
<s> 

true but not an english woman </s>
<s> 

a citizeness of france </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  by birth </s>
<s> 

her name and family </s>
<s> 

lucie manette only daughter of doctor manette the good physician who
sits there </s>
<s> 

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience </s>
<s>  cries in exaltation
of the wellknown good physician rent the hall </s>
<s>  so capriciously were
the people moved that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him </s>
<s> 

on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had set his foot
according to doctor manettes reiterated instructions </s>
<s>  the same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him and had prepared every
inch of his road </s>
<s> 

the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not
sooner </s>
<s> 

he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had no means
of living in france save those he had resigned </s>
<s>  whereas in england
he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature </s>
<s> 
he had returned when he did on the pressing and written entreaty of
a french citizen who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence </s>
<s>  he had come back to save a citizens life and to bear his
testimony at whatever personal hazard to the truth </s>
<s>  was that criminal
in the eyes of the republic </s>
<s> 

the populace cried enthusiastically no </s>
<s>  and the president rang his
bell to quiet them </s>
<s>  which it did not for they continued to cry no </s>
<s> 
 until they left off of their own will </s>
<s> 

the president required the name of that citizen </s>
<s>  the accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness </s>
<s>  he also referred with confidence
to the citizens letter which had been taken from him at the barrier
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the president </s>
<s> 

the doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that
it would be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read </s>
<s>  citizen gabelle was called to confirm it and did so </s>
<s>  citizen
gabelle hinted with infinite delicacy and politeness that in the
pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbayein fact had rather passed out
of the tribunals patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago </s>
<s>  when he
had been summoned before it and had been set at liberty on the jurys
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered as to himself by the surrender of the citizen evremonde
called darnay </s>
<s> 

doctor manette was next questioned </s>
<s>  his high personal popularity
and the clearness of his answers made a great impression </s>
<s>  but as he
proceeded as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment </s>
<s>  that the accused had remained in
england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile </s>
<s>  that so far from being in favour with the aristocrat
government there he had actually been tried for his life by it as
the foe of england and friend of the united statesas he brought these
circumstances into view with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and the
populace became one </s>
<s>  at last when he appealed by name to monsieur
lorry an english gentleman then and there present who like himself
had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his
account of it the jury declared that they had heard enough and that
they were ready with their votes if the president were content to
receive them </s>
<s> 

at every vote the jurymen voted aloud and individually the populace
set up a shout of applause </s>
<s>  all the voices were in the prisoners
favour and the president declared him free </s>
<s> 

then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy or which they regarded as some setoff against
their swollen account of cruel rage </s>
<s>  no man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable </s>
<s>  it is probable
to a blending of all the three with the second predominating </s>
<s>  no sooner
was the acquittal pronounced than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion </s>
<s>  none the less because he knew very well that the very same
people carried by another current would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets </s>
<s> 

his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried
rescued him from these caresses for the moment </s>
<s>  five were to be tried
together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed </s>
<s>  so quick was the tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost that these five came down to
him before he left the place condemned to die within twentyfour
hours </s>
<s>  the first of them told him so with the customary prison sign
of deatha raised fingerand they all added in words long live the
republic </s>
<s> 

the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen their proceedings
for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate there was a great
crowd about it in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
courtexcept two for which he looked in vain </s>
<s>  on his coming out the
concourse made at him anew weeping embracing and shouting all by
turns and all together until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted seemed to run mad like the people on the
shore </s>
<s> 

they put him into a great chair they had among them and which they had
taken either out of the court itself or one of its rooms or passages </s>
<s> 
over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top </s>
<s>  in this car of triumph not
even the doctors entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on mens shoulders with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine </s>
<s> 

in wild dreamlike procession embracing whom they met and pointing
him out they carried him on </s>
<s>  reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing republican colour in winding and tramping through them as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived </s>

had gone on before to prepare her and when her husband stood upon his
feet she dropped insensible in his arms </s>

as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen a few of the people fell to dancing </s>
<s>  instantly all the
rest fell to dancing and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole </s>
<s> 
then they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets and along the rivers bank
and over the bridge the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away </s>

before him </s>

all the air round was so thick and dark the people were so passionately

vague suspicion and black malice it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be </s>
<s> 
the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets </s>
<s>  her mind pursued
them looking for him among the condemned </s>
<s>  and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more </s>

their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind </s>

the safest way of life involving the least offence to the people but
because they were not rich and charles throughout his imprisonment
had had to pay heavily for his bad food and for his guard and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners </s>
<s>  partly on this account and
partly to avoid a domestic spy they kept no servant </s>
<s>  the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate rendered them
occasional service </s>
<s>  and jerry almost wholly transferred to them by
mr </s>
<s>  lorry had become their daily retainer and had his bed there every
night </s>

himself appeared from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde called
darnay </s>
<s> 

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed </s>
<s>  in the doctors little household as
in very many others the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening in small quantities and at various small
shops </s>
<s>  to avoid attracting notice and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy was the general desire </s>
<s> 

for some months past miss pross and <abvr> cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors </s>

direction </s>

pleased to call it than <abvr> cruncher did </s>
<s>  so her manner of marketing
was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article and if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted to look round for that thing lay hold
of it and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded </s>

conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the
nature of your calling </s>

to shape itself into a purpose <abvr> barsad </s>

what purpose </s>

it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the
street </s>

miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life
remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and looked up
in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only
contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man </s>

will play the losing one </s>

he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against <abvr> lorry </s>

mr </s>

but access to him said <abvr> lorry if it should go ill before the
tribunal will not save him </s>

i never said it would </s>

mr </s>

unprepared for </s>

to return to poor darnay said carton </s>

mr </s>

it was a long grieving sound like a sighalmost like a sob </s>

attracted <abvr> lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to the
fire </s>

passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hillside on a
wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs which was tumbling forward </s>

and topboots then in vogue and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale with his long brown hair

sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from <abvr> lorry </s>

his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log when it had
broken under the weight of his foot </s>

mr </s>

wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having
the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly
reminded of that expression </s>

to him </s>

yes </s>

yes yes thank god </s>

responding to his softened manner <abvr> lorry answered </s>

twenty years back yes </s>

closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and
nearer to the beginning </s>

you are the better for it </s>

carton terminated the conversation here by rising to help him on with
his outer coat </s>

it was ten oclock at night when he stood before the prison of la force

as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to explain

but you are not english said the woodsawyer though you wear
english dress </s>

yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder </s>

sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper </s>

whistled softly as he read it </s>

sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said </s>

consequences of mixing them </s>

certain small packets were made and given to him </s>

one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money for them
and deliberately left the shop </s>
<s>  there is nothing more to do said he
glancing upward at the moon until tomorrow </s>
<s>  i cant sleep </s>
<s> 

it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fastsailing clouds nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance </s>
<s>  it was the settled manner of a tired man who
had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end </s>

youth of great promise he had followed his father to the grave </s>

mother had died years before </s>

read at his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him </s>
<s>  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord </s>
<s> 
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live </s>
<s>  and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die </s>
<s> 

in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day put to death
and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons
and still of tomorrows and tomorrows the chain of association that
brought the words home like a rusty old ships anchor from the deep
might have been easily found </s>
<s>  he did not seek it but repeated them and
went on </s>
<s> 

with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them </s>
<s>  in the towers of the churches where no prayers
were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors plunderers and
profligates </s>
<s>  in the distant burialplaces reserved as they wrote upon
the gates for eternal sleep </s>
<s>  in the abounding gaols </s>
<s>  and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the guillotine </s>
<s>  with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury </s>
<s>  sydney carton crossed the seine again for
the lighter streets </s>
<s> 

few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps and put on heavy
shoes and trudged </s>
<s>  but the theatres were all well filled and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed and went chatting home </s>
<s>  at
one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with a mother looking
for a way across the street through the mud </s>
<s>  he carried the child over
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss </s>
<s> 

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord </s>

were in the echoes of his feet and were in the air </s>
<s>  perfectly calm
and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked </s>
<s>  but he
heard them always </s>
<s> 

the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the riverwalls of the island of paris where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead face out of the
sky </s>
<s>  then the night with the moon and the stars turned pale and died
and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to
deaths dominion </s>
<s> 

but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that burden
of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays </s>
<s> 
and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun while the river
sparkled under it </s>
<s> 

the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like a congenial
friend in the morning stillness </s>
<s>  he walked by the stream far from the
houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank </s>
<s>  when he awoke and was afoot again he lingered there yet a little
longer watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless until the
stream absorbed it and carried it on to the sea </s>
<s> like me </s>
<s> 

a tradingboat with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf then
glided into his view floated by him and died away </s>
<s>  as its silent track
in the water disappeared the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors

i alexandre manette unfortunate physician native of beauvais and
afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the bastille during the last month of the year  </s>
<s>  i write
it at stolen intervals under every difficulty </s>
<s>  i design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it </s>
<s>  some pitying hand may find it there when i
and my sorrows are dust </s>
<s> 

these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney mixed
with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity </s>
<s>  hope
has quite departed from my breast </s>
<s>  i know from terrible warnings i have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired but i
solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right
mindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that i write the
truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words whether they
be ever read by men or not at the eternal judgmentseat </s>
<s> 

one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think the
twentysecond of the month in the year  i was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air
at an hours distance from my place of residence in the street of the
school of medicine when a carriage came along behind me driven very
fast </s>
<s>  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down a head was put out at the window and a
voice called to the driver to stop </s>
<s> 

the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses
and the same voice called to me by my name </s>
<s>  i answered </s>
<s>  the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before i came up with it </s>
<s> 

i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to
conceal themselves </s>
<s>  as they stood side by side near the carriage door
i also observed that they both looked of about my own age or rather
younger and that they were greatly alike in stature manner voice
and as far as i could see face too </s>
<s> 

˜you are doctor manette </s>
<s>  said one </s>
<s> 

i am </s>
<s> 

˜doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other </s>
<s>  ˜the young
physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in paris </s>
<s> 

˜gentlemen i returned ˜i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so
graciously </s>
<s> 

˜we have been to your residence said the first ˜and not being
so fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of
overtaking you </s>
<s>  will you please to enter the carriage </s>
<s> 

the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these words
were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door </s>
<s> 
they were armed </s>
<s>  i was not </s>
<s> 

˜gentlemen said i ˜pardon me </s>
<s>  but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case to
which i am summoned </s>
<s> 

the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second </s>
<s>  ˜doctor
your clients are people of condition </s>
<s>  as to the nature of the case
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it </s>
<s>  enough </s>
<s>  will you please to
enter the carriage </s>
<s> 

i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence </s>
<s>  they both
entered after methe last springing in after putting up the steps </s>
<s>  the
carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed </s>
<s> 

i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred </s>
<s>  i have no doubt that
it is word for word the same </s>
<s>  i describe everything exactly as it took
place constraining my mind not to wander from the task </s>
<s>  where i make
the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the time and put my
paper in its hidingplace </s>
<s> 

        

the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and
emerged upon the country road </s>
<s>  at twothirds of a league from the
barrieri did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards
when i traversed itit struck out of the main avenue and presently
stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed to the door of the house </s>
<s>  it was not opened immediately in
answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the face </s>
<s> 

there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs </s>
<s>  but the
other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in like manner
with his arm </s>
<s>  the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers </s>
<s> 

from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found
locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had
relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber </s>
<s>  i was
conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain
lying on a bed </s>
<s> 

the patient was a woman of great beauty and young </s>
<s>  assuredly not much
past twenty </s>
<s>  her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs </s>
<s>  i noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentlemans dress </s>
<s>  on one of them which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw the armorial bearings of a noble
and the letter e </s>
<s> 

i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient </s>
<s> 
for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth and was
in danger of suffocation </s>
<s>  my first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing </s>
<s>  and in moving the scarf aside the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight </s>
<s> 

i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down and looked into her face </s>
<s>  her eyes were dilated and
wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeated the
words ˜my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s>  and then counted up to
twelve and said ˜hush </s>
<s>  for an instant and no more she would pause
to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin again and she
would repeat the cry ˜my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s>  and
would count up to twelve and say ˜hush </s>
<s>  there was no variation in the
order or the manner </s>
<s>  there was no cessation but the regular moments
pause in the utterance of these sounds </s>
<s> 

˜how long i asked ˜has this lasted </s>
<s> 

to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the
younger </s>
<s>  by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority </s>
<s>  it
was the elder who replied ˜since about this hour last night </s>
<s> 

˜she has a husband a father and a brother </s>
<s> 

˜a brother </s>
<s> 

˜i do not address her brother </s>
<s> 

he answered with great contempt ˜no </s>
<s> 

˜she has some recent association with the number twelve </s>
<s> 

the younger brother impatiently rejoined ˜with twelve oclock </s>
<s> 

˜see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast ˜how
useless i am as you have brought me </s>
<s>  if i had known what i was coming
to see i could have come provided </s>
<s>  as it is time must be lost </s>
<s>  there
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place </s>
<s> 

the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily ˜there is
a case of medicines here </s>
<s>  and brought it from a closet and put it on
the table </s>
<s> 

        

i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my
lips </s>
<s>  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those </s>
<s> 

˜do you doubt them </s>
<s>  asked the younger brother </s>
<s> 

˜you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no
more </s>
<s> 

i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many
efforts the dose that i desired to give </s>
<s>  as i intended to repeat it
after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then
sat down by the side of the bed </s>
<s>  there was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance wife of the man downstairs who had retreated into
a corner </s>
<s>  the house was damp and decayed indifferently
furnishedevidently recently occupied and temporarily used </s>
<s>  some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deaden the
sound of the shrieks </s>
<s>  they continued to be uttered in their regular
succession with the cry ˜my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s>  the
counting up to twelve and ˜hush </s>
<s>  the frenzy was so violent that i had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms </s>
<s>  but i had looked to
them to see that they were not painful </s>
<s>  the only spark of encouragement
in the case was that my hand upon the sufferers breast had this much
soothing influence that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure </s>
<s>  it had no effect upon the cries </s>
<s>  no pendulum could be more
regular </s>
<s> 

for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers looking on
before the elder said </s>
<s> 

˜there is another patient </s>
<s> 

i was startled and asked ˜is it a pressing case </s>
<s> 

˜you had better see he carelessly answered </s>
<s>  and took up a light </s>
<s> 

        

the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase which
was a species of loft over a stable </s>
<s>  there was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it </s>
<s>  the rest was open to the ridge of the tiled roof and
there were beams across </s>
<s>  hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place fagots for firing and a heap of apples in sand </s>
<s>  i had to
pass through that part to get at the other </s>
<s>  my memory is circumstantial
and unshaken </s>
<s>  i try it with these details and i see them all in
this my cell in the bastille near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity as i saw them all that night </s>
<s> 

on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay a
handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most </s>
<s> 
he lay on his back with his teeth set his right hand clenched on his
breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward </s>
<s>  i could not see
where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him </s>
<s>  but i could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point </s>
<s> 

˜i am a doctor my poor fellow said i </s>
<s>  ˜let me examine it </s>
<s> 

˜i do not want it examined he answered </s>
<s>  ˜let it be </s>
<s> 

it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand away </s>
<s> 
the wound was a swordthrust received from twenty to twentyfour hours
before but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay </s>
<s>  he was then dying fast </s>
<s>  as i turned my eyes to the elder
brother i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare or rabbit </s>
<s>  not at all
as if he were a fellowcreature </s>
<s> 

˜how has this been done monsieur </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

˜a crazed young common dog </s>
<s>  a serf </s>
<s>  forced my brother to draw upon him
and has fallen by my brothers swordlike a gentleman </s>
<s> 

there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this
answer </s>
<s>  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind </s>
<s>  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy or about his fate </s>
<s> 

the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and they now
slowly moved to me </s>
<s> 

˜doctor they are very proud these nobles </s>
<s>  but we common dogs are
proud too sometimes </s>
<s>  they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us </s>
<s>  but
we have a little pride left sometimes </s>
<s>  shehave you seen her doctor </s>
<s> 

the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the
distance </s>
<s>  he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence </s>
<s> 

i said ˜i have seen her </s>
<s> 

˜she is my sister doctor </s>
<s>  they have had their shameful rights these
nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years but we
have had good girls among us </s>
<s>  i know it and have heard my father say
so </s>
<s>  she was a good girl </s>
<s>  she was betrothed to a good young man too </s>
<s>  a
tenant of his </s>
<s>  we were all tenants of histhat mans who stands there </s>
<s> 
the other is his brother the worst of a bad race </s>
<s> 

it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak </s>
<s>  but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis </s>
<s> 

˜we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common dogs
are by those superior beingstaxed by him without mercy obliged to
work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his mill obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat we
ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closed that his
people should not see it and take it from usi say we were so robbed
and hunted and were made so poor that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and that what we should
most pray for was that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out </s>
<s> 

i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth
like a fire </s>
<s>  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere </s>
<s>  but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in the
dying boy </s>
<s> 

˜nevertheless doctor my sister married </s>
<s>  he was ailing at that time
poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottageour doghut as that man would call it </s>
<s>  she had not
been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her and admired
her and asked that man to lend her to himfor what are husbands among
us </s>
<s>  he was willing enough but my sister was good and virtuous and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine </s>
<s>  what did the two
then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her
willing </s>
<s> 

the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the
lookeron and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true </s>
<s>  the two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see even in this
bastille </s>
<s>  the gentlemans all negligent indifference </s>
<s>  the peasants all
troddendown sentiment and passionate revenge </s>
<s> 

˜you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts and drive us </s>
<s>  they so harnessed him and
drove him </s>
<s>  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their
grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed </s>
<s>  they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night and ordered him back into his harness in the day </s>
<s>  but he was
not persuaded </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  taken out of harness one day at noon to feedif he
could find foodhe sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the
bell and died on her bosom </s>
<s> 

nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong </s>
<s>  he forced back the gathering shadows of death as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and to cover his
wound </s>
<s> 

˜then with that mans permission and even with his aid his
brother took her away </s>
<s>  in spite of what i know she must have told his
brotherand what that is will not be long unknown to you doctor if
it is nowhis brother took her awayfor his pleasure and diversion
for a little while </s>
<s>  i saw her pass me on the road </s>
<s>  when i took the
tidings home our fathers heart burst </s>
<s>  he never spoke one of the words
that filled it </s>
<s>  i took my young sister for i have another to a place
beyond the reach of this man and where at least she will never be
his vassal </s>
<s>  then i tracked the brother here and last night climbed
ina common dog but sword in hand </s>
<s> where is the loft window </s>
<s>  it was
somewhere here </s>
<s> 

the room was darkening to his sight </s>
<s>  the world was narrowing around
him </s>
<s>  i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor as if there had been a struggle </s>
<s> 

˜she heard me and ran in </s>
<s>  i told her not to come near us till he was
dead </s>
<s>  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money </s>
<s>  then struck
at me with a whip </s>
<s>  but i though a common dog so struck at him as to
make him draw </s>
<s>  let him break into as many pieces as he will the sword
that he stained with my common blood </s>
<s>  he drew to defend himselfthrust
at me with all his skill for his life </s>
<s> 

my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments of
a broken sword lying among the hay </s>
<s>  that weapon was a gentlemans </s>
<s>  in
another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers </s>
<s> 

˜now lift me up doctor </s>
<s>  lift me up </s>
<s>  where is he </s>
<s> 

˜he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking that he
referred to the brother </s>
<s> 

˜he </s>
<s>  proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me </s>
<s>  where is the
man who was here </s>
<s>  turn my face to him </s>
<s> 

i did so raising the boys head against my knee </s>
<s>  but invested for the
moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely </s>
<s>  obliging
me to rise too or i could not have still supported him </s>
<s> 

˜marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide and
his right hand raised ˜in the days when all these things are to be
answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad race to
answer for them </s>

separately </s>
<s>  i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that i do
it </s>
<s> 

twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air </s>
<s>  he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him
down dead </s>
<s> 

        

when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity </s>
<s>  i knew that this might last
for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave </s>
<s> 

i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced </s>
<s>  she never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words </s>
<s>  they were always ˜my husband my father and my brother </s>
<s> 
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve </s>
<s>  hush </s>
<s> 

this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw her </s>
<s>  i had
come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began to
falter </s>
<s>  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity and
byandbye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead </s>
<s> 

it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long and
fearful storm </s>
<s>  i released her arms and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn </s>
<s>  it was then that i knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen </s>
<s>  and it was then that i lost the little hope i had
had of her </s>
<s> 

˜is she dead </s>
<s>  asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the
elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse </s>
<s> 

˜not dead said i </s>
<s>  ˜but like to die </s>
<s> 

˜what strength there is in these common bodies </s>
<s>  he said looking down
at her with some curiosity </s>
<s> 

˜there is prodigious strength i answered him ˜in sorrow and
despair </s>
<s> 

he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them </s>
<s>  he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in a
subdued voice

˜doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds i
recommended that your aid should be invited </s>
<s>  your reputation is high
and as a young man with your fortune to make you are probably mindful
of your interest </s>
<s>  the things that you see here are things to be seen

<s> 

˜do you honour me with your attention doctor </s>
<s> 

˜monsieur said i ˜in my profession the communications of patients

her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried the
pulse and the heart </s>
<s>  there was life and no more </s>
<s>  looking round as i
resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me </s>
<s> 

        

i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness that i must abridge this narrative </s>
<s>  there is no confusion or
failure in my memory </s>
<s>  it can recall and could detail every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers </s>
<s> 

she lingered for a week </s>
<s>  towards the last i could understand some few
syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to her lips </s>
<s>  she
asked me where she was and i told her </s>
<s>  who i was and i told her </s>
<s>  it
was in vain that i asked her for her family name </s>
<s>  she faintly shook her
head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done </s>
<s> 

i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told the
brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day </s>
<s>  until
then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there </s>
<s>  but when it came to
that they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her </s>
<s>  as
ifthe thought passed through my mindi were dying too </s>
<s> 

i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and that
peasant a boy </s>
<s>  the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family and was ridiculous </s>
<s>  as often as i caught the younger
brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply
for knowing what i knew from the boy </s>
<s>  he was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder </s>
<s>  but i saw this </s>
<s>  i also saw that i was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder too </s>
<s> 

my patient died two hours before midnightat a time by my watch
answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her </s>
<s>  i was alone
with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended </s>

the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient to ride
away </s>

their ridingwhips and loitering up and down </s>

early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box with my name on the outside </s>

sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go </s>

tellsons bankinghouse at nine he said with a musing face </s>
<s>  shall i
do well in the mean time to show myself </s>
<s>  i think so </s>
<s>  it is best that
these people should know there is such a man as i here </s>
<s>  it is a sound
precaution and may be a necessary preparation </s>
<s>  but care care care </s>
<s> 
let me think it out </s>
<s> 

checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences </s>
<s>  his first impression was
confirmed </s>
<s>  it is best he said finally resolved that these people
should know there is such a man as i here </s>
<s>  and he turned his face
towards saint antoine </s>
<s> 

defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wineshop in
the saint antoine suburb </s>
<s>  it was not difficult for one who knew the city
well to find his house without asking any question </s>
<s>  having ascertained
its situation carton came out of those closer streets again and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner </s>
<s>  for the
first time in many years he had no strong drink </s>
<s>  since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on <abvr> lorrys hearth like a man who had
done with it </s>
<s> 

it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out
into the streets again </s>
<s>  as he passed along towards saint antoine he
stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coatcollar and
his wild hair </s>
<s>  this done he went on direct to defarges and went in </s>
<s> 

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice </s>
<s>  this man whom he had seen upon
the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the
defarges man and wife </s>
<s>  the vengeance assisted in the conversation like
a regular member of the establishment </s>
<s> 

as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent
french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced
to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered </s>
<s> 

he repeated what he had already said </s>
<s> 

english </s>
<s>  asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows </s>
<s> 

after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong foreign
accent </s>
<s>  yes madame yes </s>
<s>  i am english </s>
<s> 

madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he
took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde </s>
<s> 

defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening </s>
<s> 

how </s>
<s> 

good evening </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  good evening citizen filling his glass </s>

defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like </s>
<s> 
 madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like </s>
<s>  jacques three
pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind see you madame </s>
<s> 
 the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faith </s>
<s>  and you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
tomorrow </s>
<s> 

carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slow
forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face </s>
<s>  they were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together speaking low </s>
<s>  after a silence
of a few moments during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor they resumed
their conversation </s>
<s> 

it is true what madame says observed jacques three </s>

<s>  there
is great force in that </s>
<s>  why stop </s>
<s> 

well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere </s>
<s>  after all
the question is still where </s>

magnificent </s>

approved </s>

extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather
troubled </s>

suffered much </s>

<s> 
yes </s>
<s>  i have observed his face </s>
<s>  i have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the republic </s>
<s>  let him take care of his face </s>
<s> 

and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner
the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him </s>

i have observed his daughter repeated madame </s>
<s>  yes i have observed
his daughter more times than one </s>
<s>  i have observed her today and i
have observed her other days </s>

i have observed her in the street by the prison </s>

finger </s>

his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her as

a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis </s>

customers entered and the group was broken up </s>

paid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and asked as

the english customer was not without his reflections then that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm lift it and strike under it sharp and
deep </s>
<s> 

but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall </s>
<s>  at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present
himself in <abvr> lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety </s>

they were discussing this question and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him on
the stairs </s>

lost </s>

it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him

xiii </s>
<s>  fiftytwo


in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the day awaited
their fate </s>
<s>  they were in number as the weeks of the year </s>
<s>  fiftytwo were
to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea </s>
<s>  before their cells were quit of them new occupants
were appointed </s>
<s>  before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday
the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set
apart </s>
<s> 

two score and twelve were told off </s>
<s>  from the farmergeneral of seventy
whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her </s>
<s>  physical diseases engendered
in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims of all degrees </s>
<s> 
and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable suffering
intolerable oppression and heartless indifference smote equally
without distinction </s>
<s> 

charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal </s>
<s>  in every line
of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation </s>
<s>  he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that units could
avail him nothing </s>
<s> 

nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him to compose his mind to what it must bear </s>
<s>  his hold on life
was strong and it was very very hard to loosen </s>
<s>  by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter there </s>
<s>  and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded
this was closed again </s>
<s>  there was a hurry too in all his thoughts
a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended against
resignation </s>
<s>  if for a moment he did feel resigned then his wife and
child who had to live after him seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing </s>
<s> 

but all this was at first </s>
<s>  before long the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang up to stimulate
him </s>
<s>  next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet fortitude </s>
<s>  so
by degrees he calmed into the better state when he could raise his
thoughts much higher and draw comfort down </s>
<s> 

before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had
travelled thus far on his last way </s>
<s>  being allowed to purchase the means
of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished </s>
<s> 

he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had known nothing
of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it from herself
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and uncles
responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read </s>
<s>  he had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished was the one conditionfully intelligible nowthat
her father had attached to their betrothal and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage </s>
<s>  he entreated her
for her fathers sake never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper or had had it recalled
to him for the moment or for good by the story of the tower on
that old sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden </s>
<s>  if he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there and which had been described to all the world </s>
<s>  he
besought herthough he added that he knew it was needlessto console
her father by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes </s>
<s>  next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing and her overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their
dear child he adjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her
father </s>
<s> 

to her father himself he wrote in the same strain </s>
<s>  but he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care </s>
<s>  and
he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending </s>
<s> 

to <abvr> lorry he commended them all and explained his worldly affairs </s>
<s> 
that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment all was done </s>
<s>  he never thought of carton </s>
<s>  his mind was so
full of the others that he never once thought of him </s>
<s> 

he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out </s>
<s>  when
he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world </s>
<s> 

but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining
forms </s>
<s>  free and happy back in the old house in soho though it had
nothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and light of
heart he was with lucie again and she told him it was all a dream and
he had never gone away </s>
<s>  a pause of forgetfulness and then he had even
suffered and had come back to her dead and at peace and yet there
was no difference in him </s>
<s>  another pause of oblivion and he awoke in the
sombre morning unconscious where he was or what had happened until it
flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death </s>
<s> 

thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fiftytwo heads
were to fall </s>
<s>  and now while he was composed and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his waking
thoughts which was very difficult to master </s>
<s> 

he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life </s>
<s>  how
high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he would be
stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would be dyed
red which way his face would be turned whether he would be the first
or might be the last </s>
<s>  these and many similar questions in nowise
directed by his will obtruded themselves over and over again countless
times </s>
<s>  neither were they connected with fear </s>
<s>  he was conscious of no
fear </s>
<s>  rather they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came </s>
<s>  a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred </s>
<s>  a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his than his own </s>
<s> 

the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again </s>
<s>  nine gone for ever ten gone for
ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away </s>
<s>  after a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him he had got the better of it </s>
<s>  he walked up and down softly
repeating their names to himself </s>
<s>  the worst of the strife was over </s>
<s> 
he could walk up and down free from distracting fancies praying for
himself and for them </s>
<s> 

twelve gone for ever </s>
<s> 

he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets </s>
<s>  therefore he resolved to keep two
before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others </s>
<s> 

walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast a very
different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at la force
he heard one struck away from him without surprise </s>
<s>  the hour had
measured like most other hours </s>
<s>  devoutly thankful to heaven for his
recovered selfpossession he thought there is but another now and
turned to walk again </s>
<s> 

footsteps in the stone passage outside the door </s>
<s>  he stopped </s>
<s> 

the key was put in the lock and turned </s>
<s>  before the door was opened or
as it opened a man said in a low voice in english </s>
<s>  he has never seen
me here </s>
<s>  i have kept out of his way </s>
<s>  go you in alone </s>
<s>  i wait near </s>
<s>  lose
no time </s>
<s> 

the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him
face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on his
features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton </s>
<s> 

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for the
first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining </s>
<s>  but he spoke and it was his voice </s>
<s>  he took the prisoners
hand and it was his real grasp </s>
<s>

a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well
remember </s>

the prisoner turned his face partly aside </s>
<s> 

you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means </s>
<s>  i have
no time to tell you </s>
<s>  you must comply with ittake off those boots you
wear and draw on these of mine </s>
<s> 

there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisoner </s>

carton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightning got
him down into it and stood over him barefoot </s>

<s>  as he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writers face </s>

the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he looked about
him vacantly </s>

the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his
forehead on his hands </s>

<s>  so

the door closed and carton was left alone </s>
<s>  straining his powers of

suspicion or alarm </s>
<s>  there was none </s>
<s>  keys turned doors clashed
footsteps passed along distant passages </s>
<s>  no cry was raised or hurry
made that seemed unusual </s>
<s>  breathing more freely in a little while he
sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two </s>

sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then
began to be audible </s>
<s>  several doors were opened in succession and
finally his own </s>
<s>  a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in merely
saying follow me evremonde </s>

the others who were brought there to have their arms bound </s>

as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fiftytwo
were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace him
as having a knowledge of him </s>
<s>  it thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery </s>
<s>  but the man went on </s>
<s>  a very few moments after that a young
woman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting and came to speak to him </s>

citizen evremonde she said touching him with her cold hand </s>

<s>  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature

started from his eyes </s>

i am not afraid to die citizen evremonde but i have done nothing </s>
<s>  i

in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury </s>
<s>  not in the wineshop did madame
defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the woodsawyer
erst a mender of roads </s>
<s>  the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference but abided at a little distance like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required or to offer an opinion until invited </s>
<s> 

but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good
republican </s>
<s>  eh </s>
<s> 

there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes in france </s>
<s> 

peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak </s>
<s>  my husband
fellowcitizen is a good republican and a bold man </s>
<s>  he has deserved
well of the republic and possesses its confidence </s>
<s>  but my husband has
his weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor </s>
<s> 

it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his head
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth </s>
<s>  it is not quite like a good
citizen </s>
<s>  it is a thing to regret </s>
<s> 

see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i </s>
<s>  he may wear
his head or lose it for any interest i have in him </s>
<s>  it is all one to
me </s>
<s>  but the evremonde people are to be exterminated and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father </s>
<s> 

she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three </s>
<s>  i have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson held
them up </s>
<s>  ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure </s>
<s> 

madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little </s>
<s> 

the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment
of his words has golden hair and blue eyes </s>
<s>  and we seldom have a child
there </s>
<s>  it is a pretty sight </s>
<s> 

in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction
i cannot trust my husband in this matter </s>
<s>  not only do i feel since
last night that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects </s>
<s> 
but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning
and then they might escape </s>
<s> 

that must never be croaked jacques three </s>
<s>  no one must escape </s>
<s>  we
have not half enough as it is </s>
<s>  we ought to have six score a day </s>
<s> 

in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility </s>
<s>  i must act for myself
therefore </s>
<s>  come hither little citizen </s>
<s> 

the woodsawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the
submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap </s>
<s> 

touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly
that she made to the prisoners </s>
<s>  you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day </s>
<s> 

ay ay why not </s>
<s>  cried the sawyer </s>
<s>  every day in all weathers from
two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one sometimes
without </s>
<s>  i know what i know </s>
<s>  i have seen with my eyes </s>
<s> 

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen </s>
<s> 

clearly plots said jacques three </s>
<s>  transparently </s>
<s> 

there is no doubt of the jury </s>
<s>  inquired madame defarge letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile </s>
<s> 

rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness </s>
<s>  i answer for my
fellowjurymen </s>
<s> 

now let me see said madame defarge pondering again </s>
<s>  yet once more </s>
<s> 
can i spare this doctor to my husband </s>
<s>  i have no feeling either way </s>
<s>  can
i spare him </s>
<s> 

he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice </s>
<s> 
we really have not heads enough </s>
<s>  it would be a pity i think </s>
<s> 

he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge </s>
<s>  i
cannot speak of one without the other </s>
<s>  and i must not be silent and
trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here </s>
<s>  for i am not a
bad witness </s>
<s> 

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses </s>
<s>  the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be a
celestial witness </s>
<s> 

he must take his chance said madame defarge </s>
<s>  no i cannot spare
him </s>
<s>  you are engaged at three oclock </s>
<s>  you are going to see the batch of
today executed </s>
<s> you </s>
<s> 

the question was addressed to the woodsawyer who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative </s>
<s>  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber </s>
<s>  he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been
suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of madame defarges head of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety every hour in the day </s>
<s> 

i said madame am equally engaged at the same place </s>
<s>  after it is
oversay at eight tonightcome you to me in saint antoine and we
will give information against these people at my section </s>
<s> 

the woodsawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness </s>
<s>  the citizeness looking at him he became embarrassed evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among his wood and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw </s>
<s> 

madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door and there expounded her further views to them thus </s>
<s> 

she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death </s>
<s>  she will
be mourning and grieving </s>
<s>  she will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the republic </s>
<s>  she will be full of sympathy with its enemies </s>
<s> 
i will go to her </s>
<s> 

what an admirable woman </s>
<s>  what an adorable woman </s>
<s>  exclaimed jacques
three rapturously </s>
<s>  ah my cherished </s>
<s>  cried the vengeance </s>
<s>  and
embraced her </s>
<s> 

take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her
lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat </s>
<s>  keep
me my usual chair </s>
<s>  go you there straight for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual today </s>
<s> 

i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with
alacrity and kissing her cheek </s>
<s>  you will not be late </s>
<s> 

i shall be there before the commencement </s>
<s> 

and before the tumbrils arrive </s>
<s>  be sure you are there my soul said
the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the
street before the tumbrils arrive </s>
<s> 

madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the
mud and round the corner of the prison wall </s>
<s>  the vengeance and the
juryman looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative
of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments </s>
<s> 

there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand </s>
<s>  but there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the streets </s>
<s>  of a
strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great
determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities </s>
<s>  the troubled time would have
heaved her up under any circumstances </s>
<s>  but imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong and an inveterate hatred of a class
opportunity had developed her into a tigress </s>
<s>  she was absolutely without
pity </s>
<s>  if she had ever had the virtue in her it had quite gone out of
her </s>
<s> 

it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers </s>
<s>  she saw not him but them </s>
<s>  it was nothing to her that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan </s>
<s>  that was
insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies and
her prey and as such had no right to live </s>
<s>  to appeal to her was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself </s>
<s>  if she had
been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself </s>
<s>  nor if she had
been ordered to the axe tomorrow would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there </s>
<s> 

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe </s>
<s>  carelessly
worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap </s>
<s>  lying hidden in her
bosom was a loaded pistol </s>
<s>  lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened
dagger </s>
<s>  thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such
a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood barefoot and barelegged on the brown
seasand madame defarge took her way along the streets </s>
<s> 

now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last night
the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged <abvr> lorrys
attention </s>
<s>  it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers should be reduced to the utmost </s>
<s>  since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there </s>
<s> 
finally he had proposed after anxious consideration that miss pross
and jerry who were at liberty to leave the city should leave it at
three oclock in the lightestwheeled conveyance known to that period </s>
<s> 
unencumbered with luggage they would soon overtake the coach and
passing it and preceding it on the road would order its horses in
advance and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night when delay was the most to be dreaded </s>
<s> 

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy </s>
<s>  she and jerry had
beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge
taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the
elsedeserted lodging in which they held their consultation </s>
<s> 

now what do you think <abvr> cruncher said miss pross whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or move or live </s>
<s> 
what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard </s>
<s>  another
carriage having already gone from here today it might awaken
suspicion </s>
<s> 

my opinion miss returned <abvr> cruncher is as youre right </s>
<s>  likewise
wot ill stand by you right or wrong </s>

miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any plan </s>
<s>  are
you capable of forming any plan my dear good <abvr> cruncher </s>

respectin a future spear o life miss returned <abvr> cruncher i
hope so </s>

two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis </s>

oh for gracious sake </s>
<s>  cried miss pross still wildly crying record
them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man </s>
<s> 

first said <abvr> cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this never no
more will i do it never no more </s>
<s> 

i am quite sure <abvr> cruncher returned miss pross that you
never will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is </s>

no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you </s>
<s>  second </s>

whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be said miss pross
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it
is best that <abvr> cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence </s>
<s> o my poor darlings </s>
<s> 

i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded <abvr> cruncher with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my words
be took down and took to <abvr> cruncher through yourselfthat wot my
opinions respectin flopping has undergone a change and that wot i only
hope with all my heart as <abvr> cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time </s>
<s> 

there there there </s>
<s>  i hope she is my dear man cried the distracted
miss pross and i hope she finds it answering her expectations </s>
<s> 

forbid it proceeded <abvr> cruncher with additional solemnity
additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now </s>
<s>  forbid it as we shouldnt all
flop if it was anyways conwenient to get ˜em out o this here dismal
risk </s>
<s>  forbid it miss </s>
<s>  wot i say forbid it </s>
<s>  this was <abvr> crunchers
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one </s>
<s> 

and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
nearer and nearer </s>
<s> 

if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may rely
upon my telling <abvr> cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said </s>
<s>  and at all events
you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time </s>
<s>  now pray let us think </s>
<s>  my esteemed <abvr>
cruncher let us think </s>
<s> 

still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer
and nearer </s>
<s> 

if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me </s>
<s>  wouldnt
that be best </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher thought it might be best </s>
<s> 

where could you wait for me </s>
<s>  asked miss pross </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar </s>
<s>  alas </s>
<s>  temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed </s>
<s> 

by the cathedral door said miss pross </s>
<s>  would it be much out of
the way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two
towers </s>
<s> 

no miss answered <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s> 

then like the best of men said miss pross go to the postinghouse
straight and make that change </s>
<s> 

i am doubtful said <abvr> cruncher hesitating and shaking his head
about leaving of you you see </s>
<s>  we dont know what may happen </s>
<s> 

heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for me </s>
<s> 
take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as you can
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here </s>
<s>  i feel certain
of it </s>
<s>  there </s>
<s>  bless you <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s>  thinknot of me but of the lives
that may depend on both of us </s>
<s> 

this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his decided <abvr> cruncher </s>
<s>  with an encouraging nod or two he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed </s>
<s> 

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution was a great relief to miss pross </s>
<s>  the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets was another relief </s>
<s>  she looked at her watch and it was twenty
minutes past two </s>
<s>  she had no time to lose but must get ready at once </s>
<s> 

afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes
which were swollen and red </s>
<s>  haunted by her feverish apprehensions she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her </s>
<s>  in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out for she saw a figure standing in the room </s>
<s> 

the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge </s>
<s>  by strange stern ways and through much staining blood
those feet had come to meet that water </s>
<s> 

madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evremonde </s>
<s> 
where is she </s>
<s> 

it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standing open
and would suggest the flight </s>
<s>  her first act was to shut them </s>
<s>  there were
four in the room and she shut them all </s>
<s>  she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied </s>
<s> 

madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement
and rested on her when it was finished </s>
<s>  miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her </s>
<s>  years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness
of her appearance </s>
<s>  but she too was a determined woman in her different
way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes every inch </s>
<s> 

you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss
pross in her breathing </s>
<s>  nevertheless you shall not get the better of
me </s>
<s>  i am an englishwoman </s>
<s> 

madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of
miss prosss own perception that they two were at bay </s>
<s>  she saw a tight
hard wiry woman before her as <abvr> lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand in the years gone by </s>
<s>  she knew full well that
miss pross was the familys devoted friend </s>
<s>  miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the familys malevolent enemy </s>
<s> 

on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing </s>
<s>  i
wish to see her </s>
<s> 

i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may
depend upon it ill hold my own against them </s>
<s> 

each spoke in her own language </s>
<s>  neither understood the others words </s>
<s> 
both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner what
the unintelligible words meant </s>
<s> 

it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment said madame defarge </s>
<s>  good patriots will know what that means </s>
<s> 
let me see her </s>
<s>  go tell her that i wish to see her </s>
<s>  do you hear </s>
<s> 

if those eyes of yours were bedwinches returned miss pross and i
was an english fourposter they shouldnt loose a splinter of me </s>
<s>  no
you wicked foreign woman </s>
<s>  i am your match </s>
<s> 

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail </s>
<s>  but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught </s>
<s> 

woman imbecile and piglike </s>
<s>  said madame defarge frowning </s>
<s>  i take no
answer from you </s>
<s>  i demand to see her </s>
<s>  either tell her that i demand
to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her </s>
<s> 
 this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm </s>
<s> 

i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language </s>
<s>  but i would give all i have
except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or any
part of it </s>
<s> 

neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes </s>
<s>  madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her </s>
<s>  but she now advanced one step </s>
<s> 

i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate </s>
<s>  i dont care an
english twopence for myself </s>
<s>  i know that the longer i keep you here the
greater hope there is for my ladybird </s>
<s>  ill not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me </s>
<s> 

thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath </s>
<s> 
thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life </s>
<s> 

but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes </s>
<s>  this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness </s>
<s>  ha ha </s>
<s>  she
laughed you poor wretch </s>
<s>  what are you worth </s>
<s>  i address myself to that
doctor </s>
<s>  then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor </s>
<s>  wife
of evremonde </s>
<s>  child of evremonde </s>
<s>  any person but this miserable fool
answer the citizeness defarge </s>
<s> 

perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone </s>
<s> 
three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in </s>
<s> 

those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing there
are odds and ends upon the ground </s>
<s>  there is no one in that room behind
you </s>
<s>  let me look </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s>  said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer </s>
<s> 

if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and
brought back said madame defarge to herself </s>
<s> 

as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you are
uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself </s>
<s>  and you shall not
know that if i can prevent your knowing it </s>
<s>  and know that or not know
that you shall not leave here while i can hold you </s>
<s> 

i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me
i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said
madame defarge </s>
<s> 

we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard we are
not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling said miss pross </s>
<s> 

madame defarge made at the door </s>
<s>  miss pross on the instinct of the
moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her tight </s>
<s> 
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike </s>
<s>  miss pross
with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate
clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had </s>
<s>  the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face </s>
<s>  but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman </s>
<s> 

soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled
waist </s>
<s>  it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered tones you
shall not draw it </s>
<s>  i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it </s>
<s>  i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies </s>
<s> 

madame defarges hands were at her bosom </s>
<s>  miss pross looked up saw
what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood
aloneblinded with smoke </s>
<s> 

all this was in a second </s>
<s>  as the smoke cleared leaving an awful
stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground </s>
<s> 

in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help </s>
<s>  happily she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did in time to check herself and go back </s>
<s>  it was dreadful to
go in at the door again </s>
<s>  but she did go in and even went near it to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear </s>
<s>  these she put on
out on the staircase first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key </s>
<s>  she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry and then got up and hurried away </s>
<s> 

by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped </s>
<s>  by good fortune too she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman </s>
<s>  she needed both advantages for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was torn and her
dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways </s>
<s> 

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river </s>

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets </s>

are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go steadily onward </s>

so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle that

the tumbrils </s>

question </s>

horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it with
their swords </s>

at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down to converse with a
