i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both
hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright
sir perhaps i shouldnt be sick and perhaps i could attend more </s>

he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock </s>

at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his
armsclasping himself as if to hold himself togetherand limped
towards the low church wall </s>
<s>  as i saw him go picking his way among the
nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people

when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose

again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking
his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there for steppingplaces when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in </s>
<s> 

the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped
to look after him </s>

nearly so broad nor yet so black </s>

angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed </s>
<s>  on the edge of the
river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright </s>

by which the sailors steeredlike an unhooped cask upon a polean
ugly thing when you were near it </s>
<s>  the other a gibbet with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate </s>
<s>  the man was limping on
towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come
down and going back to hook himself up again </s>
<s>  it gave me a terrible
turn when i thought so </s>
<s>  and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too </s>

round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him </s>

i was frightened again and ran home without stopping </s>

chapter ii

my sister <abvr> joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she had brought me up by hand </s>
<s>  having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and
heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as
well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up
by hand </s>
<s> 

she was not a goodlooking woman my sister </s>
<s>  and i had a general
impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand </s>
<s>  joe
was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites </s>
<s>  he was a mild
goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dear fellowa sort
of hercules in strength and also in weakness </s>
<s> 

my sister <abvr> joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing
redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap </s>
<s>  she was tall
and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her
figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in
front that was stuck full of pins and needles </s>
<s>  she made it a powerful
merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this
apron so much </s>
<s>  though i really see no reason why she should have worn it
at all </s>
<s>  or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it
off every day of her life </s>
<s> 

joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the
dwellings in our country weremost of them at that time </s>
<s>  when i ran
home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen </s>
<s>  joe and i being fellowsufferers and having
confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it
sitting in the chimney corner </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip </s>
<s>  and shes
out now making it a bakers dozen </s>
<s> 

is she </s>
<s> 

yes pip said joe </s>
<s>  and whats worse shes got tickler with her </s>
<s> 

at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round and looked in great depression at the fire </s>
<s>  tickler
was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame </s>
<s> 

she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at
tickler and she rampaged out </s>
<s>  thats what she did said joe slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at
it </s>
<s>  she rampaged out pip </s>
<s> 

has she been gone long joe </s>
<s>  i always treated him as a larger species
of child and as no more than my equal </s>

well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock shes been on the
rampage this last spell about five minutes pip </s>
<s>  shes a coming </s>
<s>  get
behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you </s>
<s> 

i took the advice </s>
<s>  my sister <abvr> joe throwing the door wide open
and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and
applied tickler to its further investigation </s>
<s>  she concluded by throwing
mei often served as a connubial missileat joe who glad to get hold
of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his great leg </s>
<s> 

where have you been you young monkey </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe stamping her
foot </s>
<s>  tell me directly what youve been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit or id have you out of that corner if you was
fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys </s>
<s> 

i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and
rubbing myself </s>
<s> 

churchyard </s>
<s>  repeated my sister </s>
<s>  if it warnt for me youd have been
to the churchyard long ago and stayed there </s>
<s>  who brought you up by
hand </s>
<s> 

you did said i </s>
<s> 

and why did i do it i should like to know </s>
<s>  exclaimed my sister </s>
<s> 

i whimpered i dont know </s>
<s> 

i dont </s>
<s>  said my sister </s>
<s>  id never do it again </s>
<s>  i know that </s>
<s>  i may
truly say ive never had this apron of mine off since born you were </s>
<s> 
its bad enough to be a blacksmiths wife and him a gargery without
being your mother </s>
<s> 

my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at
the fire </s>
<s>  for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the
mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me
in the avenging coals </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe restoring tickler to his station </s>
<s>  churchyard
indeed </s>
<s>  you may well say churchyard you two </s>
<s>  one of us by the by had
not said it at all </s>
<s>  youll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one
of these days and o a prrrecious pair youd be without me </s>
<s> 

as she applied herself to set the teathings joe peeped down at me
over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed </s>
<s>  after that he sat feeling his
rightside flaxen curls and whisker and following <abvr> joe about with
his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times </s>
<s> 

my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us
that never varied </s>
<s>  first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bibwhere it sometimes got a pin into it and
sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths </s>
<s>  then she
took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in
an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plasterusing both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust </s>
<s>  then she gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf </s>
<s>  which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into
two halves of which joe got one and i the other </s>
<s> 

on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my
slice </s>
<s>  i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man </s>
<s>  i knew
mrs </s>
<s>  joes housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe </s>
<s>  therefore
i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers </s>
<s> 

the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i
found to be quite awful </s>
<s>  it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water </s>
<s> 
and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe </s>
<s>  in
our alreadymentioned freemasonry as fellowsufferers and in his
goodnatured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each
others admiration now and thenwhich stimulated us to new exertions </s>
<s> 
tonight joe several times invited me by the display of his fast
diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition </s>
<s>  but
he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and
my untouched bread and butter on the other </s>
<s>  at last i desperately
considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances </s>
<s>  i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at
me and got my bread and butter down my leg </s>
<s> 

joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he
didnt seem to enjoy </s>
<s>  he turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like
a pill </s>
<s>  he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone </s>
<s> 

the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold
of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sisters
observation </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  said she smartly as she put down her cup </s>
<s> 

i say you know </s>
<s>  muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance </s>
<s>  pip old chap </s>
<s>  youll do yourself a mischief </s>
<s>  itll stick
somewhere </s>
<s>  you cant have chawed it pip </s>
<s> 

whats the matter now </s>
<s>  repeated my sister more sharply than before </s>
<s> 

if you can cough any trifle on it up pip id recommend you to do it
 said joe all aghast </s>
<s>  manners is manners but still your elths your
elth </s>
<s> 

by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe
and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while
against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily
on </s>
<s> 

now perhaps youll mention whats the matter said my sister out of
breath you staring great stuck pig </s>
<s> 

joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and
looked at me again </s>
<s> 

you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek
and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone
you and me is always friends and id be the last to tell upon you
any time </s>
<s>  but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us and then again at mesuch a most oncommon bolt as that </s>
<s> 

been bolting his food has he </s>
<s>  cried my sister </s>
<s> 

you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at <abvr> joe
with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your
agefrequentand as a boy ive been among a many bolters </s>
<s>  but i never
see your bolting equal yet pip and its a mercy you aint bolted
dead </s>
<s> 

my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying
nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed </s>
<s> 

some medical beast had revived tarwater in those days as a fine
medicine and <abvr> joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard </s>
<s> 
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness </s>
<s>  at the
best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new
fence </s>
<s>  on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater
comfort while <abvr> joe held my head under her arm as a boot would
be held in a bootjack </s>
<s>  joe got off with half a pint </s>
<s>  but was made to
swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire because he had had a turn </s>
<s>  judging from
myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had
none before </s>
<s> 

conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy </s>
<s>  but when in
the case of a boy that secret burden cooperates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great
punishment </s>
<s>  the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob <abvr> joei
never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as hisunited to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind </s>
<s>  then
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the
voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy declaring that he couldnt and wouldnt starve until tomorrow
but must be fed now </s>
<s>  at other times i thought what if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver tonight
instead of tomorrow </s>
<s>  if ever anybodys hair stood on end with terror
mine must have done so then </s>
<s>  but perhaps nobodys ever did </s>
<s> 

it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with
a copperstick from seven to eight by the dutch clock </s>
<s>  i tried it with
the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable </s>
<s>  happily i slipped away
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom </s>
<s> 

hark </s>
<s>  said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm
in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed </s>
<s>  was that great guns
joe </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  theres another conwict off </s>

what does that mean joe </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly
escaped </s>
<s>  escaped </s>
<s>  administering the definition like tarwater </s>
<s> 

while <abvr> joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my
mouth into the forms of saying to joe whats a convict </s>
<s>  joe put his
mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i
could make out nothing of it but the single word pip </s>
<s> 

there was a conwict off last night said joe aloud after
sunsetgun </s>
<s>  and they fired warning of him </s>
<s>  and now it appears theyre
firing warning of another </s>
<s> 

whos firing </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work
what a questioner he is </s>
<s>  ask no questions and youll be told no lies </s>
<s> 

it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be
told lies by her even if i did ask questions </s>
<s>  but she never was polite
unless there was company </s>
<s> 

at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like sulks </s>
<s>  therefore i naturally pointed to <abvr>
joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her </s>
<s>  but joe wouldnt
hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it </s>
<s>  but i could make nothing of
the word </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  joe said i as a last resort i should like to knowif you
wouldnt much mindwhere the firing comes from </s>
<s> 

lord bless the boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed my sister as if she didnt quite mean
that but rather the contrary </s>
<s>  from the hulks </s>
<s> 

ohh </s>
<s>  said i looking at joe </s>
<s>  hulks </s>
<s> 

joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so </s>
<s> 

and please whats hulks </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

thats the way with this boy </s>
<s>  exclaimed my sister pointing me out
with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me </s>
<s>  answer him one
question and hell ask you a dozen directly </s>
<s>  hulks are prisonships
right ˜cross th meshes </s>
<s>  we always used that name for marshes in our
country </s>
<s> 

i wonder whos put into prisonships and why theyre put there </s>
<s>  said
i in a general way and with quiet desperation </s>
<s> 

it was too much for <abvr> joe who immediately rose </s>
<s>  i tell you what
young fellow said she i didnt bring you up by hand to badger
peoples lives out </s>
<s>  it would be blame to me and not praise if i had </s>
<s> 
people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob
and forge and do all sorts of bad </s>
<s>  and they always begin by asking
questions </s>
<s>  now you get along to bed </s>
<s> 

i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs
in the dark with my head tinglingfrom <abvr> joes thimble
having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last wordsi
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me </s>
<s>  i was clearly on my way there </s>
<s>  i had begun by asking
questions and i was going to rob <abvr> joe </s>
<s> 

since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror </s>
<s> 
no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror </s>
<s>  i was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver </s>
<s>  i was
in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg </s>
<s>  i was in mortal
terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted </s>
<s>  i had
no hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister who repulsed
me at every turn </s>
<s>  i am afraid to think of what i might have done on
requirement in the secrecy of my terror </s>
<s> 

if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong springtide to the hulks </s>
<s>  a ghostly
pirate calling out to me through a speakingtrumpet as i passed the
gibbetstation that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once and not put it off </s>
<s>  i was afraid to sleep even if i had been
inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob
the pantry </s>
<s>  there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting
a light by easy friction then </s>
<s>  to have got one i must have struck it out
of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his chains </s>
<s> 

as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
with gray i got up and went downstairs </s>
<s>  every board upon the way and
every crack in every board calling after me stop thief </s>

mrs </s>

<s>  in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than
usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging
up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half
turned winking </s>

no time for anything for i had no time to spare </s>
<s>  i stole some bread
some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in

not be missed for some time </s>

there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge </s>

chapter iii

it was a rimy morning and very damp </s>
<s>  i had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all
night and using the window for a pockethandkerchief </s>
<s>  now i saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of
spiders webs </s>
<s>  hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade </s>
<s>  on
every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our villagea
direction which they never accepted for they never came therewas
invisible to me until i was quite close under it </s>
<s>  then as i looked up
at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the hulks </s>
<s> 

the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that
instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me </s>
<s> 
this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind </s>
<s>  the gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly
as could be a boy with somebody elses pork pie </s>
<s>  stop him </s>
<s>  the
cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes
and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief </s>
<s>  one black
ox with a white cravat onwho even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical airfixed me so obstinately with his eyes
and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved
round that i blubbered out to him i couldnt help it sir </s>
<s>  it wasnt
for myself i took it </s>
<s>  upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of
smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickup of his hindlegs and
a flourish of his tail </s>
<s> 

all this time i was getting on towards the river </s>
<s>  but however fast i
went i couldnt warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet </s>
<s>  i knew
my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a
sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when
i was ˜prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there </s>
<s> 
however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to
the right and consequently had to try back along the riverside on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out </s>
<s>  making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a
ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me </s>
<s> 
his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding
forward heavy with sleep </s>
<s> 

i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast
in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on
the shoulder </s>
<s>  he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but
another man </s>
<s> 

and yet this man was dressed in coarse gray too and had a great iron
on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that
the other man was </s>
<s>  except that he had not the same face and had a flat
broadbrimmed lowcrowned felt hat on </s>
<s>  all this i saw in a moment for
i had only a moment to see it in </s>
<s>  he swore an oath at me made a hit at
meit was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down for it made him stumbleand then he ran into the mist stumbling
twice as he went and i lost him </s>
<s> 

its the young man </s>
<s>  i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified
him </s>
<s>  i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had
known where it was </s>
<s> 

i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right
manhugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all
night left off hugging and limpingwaiting for me </s>
<s>  he was awfully
cold to be sure </s>
<s>  i half expected to see him drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold </s>
<s>  his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when
i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle </s>
<s>  he did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me
right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets </s>
<s> 

whats in the bottle boy </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

brandy said i </s>
<s> 

he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
mannermore like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry than a man who was eating itbut he left off to take some of
the liquor </s>
<s>  he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite
as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth
without biting it off </s>
<s> 

i think you have got the ague said i </s>
<s> 

im much of your opinion boy said he </s>
<s> 

its bad about here i told him </s>
<s>  youve been lying out on the meshes
and theyre dreadful aguish </s>

<s>  id do
that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there directly afterwards </s>
<s>  ill beat the shivers so far ill bet
you </s>
<s> 

he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all
at once </s>
<s>  staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
us and often stoppingeven stopping his jawsto listen </s>
<s>  some real or
fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly

<s> 

something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock
and was going to strike </s>
<s>  and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his
eyes </s>
<s> 

pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down
upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it </s>

i said i was glad you enjoyed it </s>

thankee my boy </s>
<s>  i do </s>
<s> 

i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food </s>
<s>  and i now
noticed a decided similarity between the dogs way of eating and the
mans </s>
<s>  the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog </s>
<s>  he
swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast </s>
<s> 
and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought
there was danger in every direction of somebodys coming to take the pie
away </s>
<s>  he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate
it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without
making a chop with his jaws at the visitor </s>
<s>  in all of which particulars
he was very like the dog </s>
<s> 

i am afraid you wont leave any of it for him said i timidly </s>
<s>  after
a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark </s>
<s>  theres no more to be got where that came from </s>
<s>  it was the
certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint </s>

leave any for him </s>

crunching of piecrust </s>

the young man </s>

i thought he looked as if he did said i </s>

just now </s>

where </s>

yonder said i pointing </s>

then there was firing </s>

i wonder you shouldnt have been sure of that i returned for
we heard it up at home and thats farther away and we were shut in
besides </s>

why see now </s>

i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man
and he looked up at it for an instant </s>
<s>  but he was down on the rank wet
grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding
his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file </s>
<s>  i
was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into
this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer </s>

i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off </s>
<s>  the last i saw
of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg </s>

i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still
going </s>

chapter iv

i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me
up </s>
<s>  but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery </s>
<s>  <abvr> joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpanan article into
which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment </s>
<s> 

and where the deuce ha you been </s>
<s>  was <abvr> joes christmas salutation
when i and my conscience showed ourselves </s>
<s> 

i said i had been down to hear the carols </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  observed <abvr>
joe </s>
<s>  you might ha done worse </s>
<s>  not a doubt of that i thought </s>
<s> 

perhaps if i warnt a blacksmiths wife and whats the same thing a
slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols
 said <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  im rather partial to carols myself and thats the
best of reasons for my never hearing any </s>
<s> 

joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
conciliatory air when <abvr> joe darted a look at him and when her eyes
were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them
to me as our token that <abvr> joe was in a cross temper </s>
<s>  this was so
much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together
be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs </s>
<s> 

we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls </s>
<s>  a handsome mincepie had
been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed and the pudding was already on the boil </s>
<s>  these extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast </s>
<s>  for i aint said <abvr> joei aint a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what ive got
before me i promise you </s>
<s> 

so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home </s>
<s>  and we took gulps of milk
and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser </s>
<s>  in
the meantime <abvr> joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage which was never
uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantelshelf each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other </s>
<s> 
mrs </s>
<s>  joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of
making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself </s>
<s>  cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by
their religion </s>
<s> 

my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that
is to say joe and i were going </s>
<s>  in his workingclothes joe was a
wellknit characteristiclooking blacksmith </s>
<s>  in his holiday clothes
he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else </s>
<s> 
nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him </s>
<s>  and
everything that he wore then grazed him </s>
<s>  on the present festive occasion
he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture
of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials </s>
<s>  as to me i think my
sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom
an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over
to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law </s>
<s> 
i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends </s>
<s>  even when i was taken to have
a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs </s>
<s> 

joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds </s>
<s>  yet what i suffered outside was nothing to
what i underwent within </s>
<s>  the terrors that had assailed me whenever
mrs </s>
<s>  joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done </s>
<s>  under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the
church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment </s>
<s>  i conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said
ye are now to declare it </s>
<s>  would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry </s>
<s>  i am far from being sure that i
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hubble
the wheelwright and <abvr> hubble </s>
<s>  and uncle pumblechook joes uncle
but <abvr> joe appropriated him who was a welltodo cornchandler in
the nearest town and drove his own chaisecart </s>
<s>  the dinner hour was
halfpast one </s>
<s>  when joe and i got home we found the table laid and
mrs </s>
<s>  joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked
it never was at any other time for the company to enter by and
everything most splendid </s>
<s>  and still not a word of the robbery </s>
<s> 

the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and
the company came </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of </s>
<s>  indeed
it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him
his head he would read the clergyman into fits </s>
<s>  he himself confessed
that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would
not despair of making his mark in it </s>
<s>  the church not being thrown
open he was as i have said our clerk </s>
<s>  but he punished the amens
tremendously </s>
<s>  and when he gave out the psalmalways giving the whole
versehe looked all round the congregation first as much as to say
you have heard my friend overhead </s>
<s>  oblige me with your opinion of this
style </s>
<s> 

i opened the door to the companymaking believe that it was a habit
of ours to open that doorand i opened it first to <abvr> wopsle next
to <abvr> and <abvr> hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook </s>
<s>  n </s>
<s> b </s>
<s>  i was
not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  joe said uncle pumblechook a large hardbreathing middleaged
slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair
standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been
all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the
compliments of the seasoni have brought you mum a bottle of sherry
wineand i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine </s>
<s> 

every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with
exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells </s>
<s> 
every christmas day <abvr> joe replied as she now replied o uncle
pumblechook </s>
<s>  this is kind </s>
<s>  every christmas day he retorted as
he now retorted its no more than your merits </s>
<s>  and now are you all
bobbish and hows sixpennorth of halfpence </s>
<s>  meaning me </s>
<s> 

we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor </s>
<s>  which was a change very like
joes change from his workingclothes to his sunday dress </s>
<s>  my sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of <abvr> hubble than in other company </s>
<s>  i remember
mrs </s>
<s>  hubble as a little curly sharpedged person in skyblue who held a
conventionally juvenile position because she had married <abvr> hubblei
dont know at what remote periodwhen she was much younger than he </s>
<s>  i
remember mr hubble as a tough highshouldered stooping old man of a
sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart </s>
<s>  so that in
my short days i always saw some miles of open country between them when
i met him coming up the lane </s>
<s> 

among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadnt
robbed the pantry in a false position </s>
<s>  not because i was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the
pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak
i didnt want to speak nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips
of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corners of pork
of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone </s>
<s> 
but they wouldnt leave me alone </s>
<s>  they seemed to think the opportunity
lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and
then and stick the point into me </s>
<s>  i might have been an unfortunate
little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these
moral goads </s>
<s> 

it began the moment we sat down to dinner </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle said grace with
theatrical declamationas it now appears to me something like a
religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the thirdand
ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful </s>
<s> 
upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low
reproachful voice do you hear that </s>
<s>  be grateful </s>
<s> 

especially said <abvr> pumblechook be grateful boy to them which
brought you up by hand </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful
presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the
young are never grateful </s>
<s>  this moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until <abvr> hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally
wicious </s>
<s>  everybody then murmured true </s>
<s>  and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner </s>
<s> 

joes station and influence were something feebler if possible when
there was company than when there was none </s>
<s>  but he always aided and
comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so
at dinnertime by giving me gravy if there were any </s>
<s>  there being plenty
of gravy today joe spooned into my plate at this point about half a
pint </s>
<s> 

a little later on in the dinner <abvr> wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity and intimatedin the usual hypothetical case of the
church being thrown openwhat kind of sermon he would have given
them </s>
<s>  after favoring them with some heads of that discourse he remarked
that he considered the subject of the days homily ill chosen </s>
<s>  which
was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects
going about </s>
<s> 

true again said uncle pumblechook </s>
<s>  youve hit it sir </s>

subjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their
tails </s>
<s>  thats whats wanted </s>
<s>  a man neednt go far to find a subject

<s>  <abvr> pumblechook added after a short
interval of reflection look at pork alone </s>
<s>  theres a subject </s>
<s>  if you
want a subject look at pork </s>

true sir </s>
<s>  many a moral for the young returned <abvr> wopsleand i
knew he was going to lug me in before he said it </s>
<s>  might be deduced
from that text </s>
<s> 

you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis </s>
<s> 

joe gave me some more gravy </s>
<s> 

swine pursued <abvr> wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork
at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian nameswine were
the companions of the prodigal </s>
<s>  the gluttony of swine is put before us

had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy </s>

detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy </s>
<s>

<s> 

of course or girl <abvr> hubble assented <abvr> wopsle rather irritably
but there is no girl present </s>
<s> 

besides said <abvr> pumblechook turning sharp on me think what youve
got to be grateful for </s>
<s>  if youd been born a squeaker

again </s>

catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts

i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with
their noses </s>

consequence </s>

the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it
until he howled </s>

comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
pause was broken which ensued upon my sisters recital and in which
pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with
indignation and abhorrence </s>

but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnt
hear the word wouldnt hear of the subject imperiously waved it all
away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water </s>
<s>  my sister who had
begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemonpeel and mixing
them </s>
<s>  for the time being at least i was saved </s>

leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude </s>

by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook partook of pudding </s>
<s>  all partook of pudding </s>

the course terminated and <abvr> pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water </s>
<s>  i began to think i should get over
the day when my sister said to joe clean platescold </s>
<s> 

i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul </s>

i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone </s>

you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best

no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip </s>

table and ran for my life </s>

chapter v

the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their
loaded muskets on our doorstep caused the dinnerparty to rise
from table in confusion and caused <abvr> joe reentering the kitchen
emptyhanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of
gracious goodness gracious me whats gonewith thepie </s>
<s> 

the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when <abvr> joe stood staring </s>
<s> 
at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses </s>
<s>  it was
the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the
company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his
right hand and his left on my shoulder </s>
<s> 

excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadnt i
am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith </s>
<s> 

and pray what might you want with him </s>
<s>  retorted my sister quick to
resent his being wanted at all </s>
<s> 

missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should
reply the honor and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance </s>
<s>  speaking
for the king i answer a little job done </s>
<s> 

this was received as rather neat in the sergeant </s>
<s>  insomuch that <abvr>
pumblechook cried audibly good again </s>
<s> 

you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked
out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find
the lock of one of ˜em goes wrong and the coupling dont act pretty </s>
<s> 
as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over
them </s>
<s> 

joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer
two hours than one </s>
<s>  will it </s>
<s>  then will you set about it at once
blacksmith </s>
<s>  said the offhand sergeant as its on his majestys
service </s>
<s>  and if my men can bear a hand anywhere theyll make themselves
useful </s>
<s>  with that he called to his men who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner </s>
<s>  and then
they stood about as soldiers do </s>
<s>  now with their hands loosely clasped
before them </s>
<s>  now resting a knee or a shoulder </s>
<s>  now easing a belt or a
pouch </s>
<s>  now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out
into the yard </s>
<s> 

all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i
was in an agony of apprehension </s>
<s>  but beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little
more of my scattered wits </s>
<s> 

would you give me the time </s>
<s>  said the sergeant addressing himself to
mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he was equal to the time </s>
<s> 

its just gone half past two </s>
<s> 

thats not so bad said the sergeant reflecting </s>
<s>  even if i was
forced to halt here nigh two hours thatll do </s>
<s>  how far might you call
yourselves from the marshes hereabouts </s>
<s>  not above a mile i reckon </s>
<s> 

just a mile said <abvr> joe </s>
<s> 

thatll do </s>
<s>  we begin to close in upon ˜em about dusk </s>
<s>  a little before
dusk my orders are </s>
<s>  thatll do </s>
<s> 

convicts sergeant </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> wopsle in a matterofcourse way </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  returned the sergeant two </s>
<s>  theyre pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still and they wont try to get clear of ˜em before
dusk </s>
<s>  anybody here seen anything of any such game </s>
<s> 

everybody myself excepted said no with confidence </s>
<s>  nobody thought of
me </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the sergeant theyll find themselves trapped in a circle
i expect sooner than they count on </s>
<s>  now blacksmith </s>
<s>  if youre ready
his majesty the king is </s>
<s> 

joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron
on and passed into the forge </s>
<s>  one of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the
rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring </s>
<s>  then joe began to
hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on </s>
<s> 

the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention but even made my sister liberal </s>
<s>  she drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy </s>
<s>  but <abvr> pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum </s>
<s>  ill
engage theres no tar in that </s>
<s>  so the sergeant thanked him and said
that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it
was equally convenient </s>
<s>  when it was given him he drank his majestys
health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his lips </s>
<s> 

good stuff eh sergeant </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

ill tell you something returned the sergeant </s>
<s>  i suspect that
stuffs of your providing </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay </s>
<s>  why </s>
<s> 

because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder youre
a man that knows whats what </s>
<s> 

dye think so </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook with his former laugh </s>
<s>  have
another glass </s>
<s> 

with you </s>
<s>  hob and nob returned the sergeant </s>
<s>  the top of mine to the
foot of yoursthe foot of yours to the top of minering once ring
twicethe best tune on the musical glasses </s>
<s>  your health </s>
<s>  may you live
a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life </s>
<s> 

the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass </s>
<s>  i noticed that <abvr> pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the
bottle from <abvr> joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality </s>
<s>  even i got some </s>
<s>  and he was so very free of the wine
that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the
same liberality when the first was gone </s>
<s> 

as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge
enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was </s>
<s>  they had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he furnished </s>
<s>  and now when they were all in lively
anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank and the redhot sparks dropped and died the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account poor wretches </s>
<s> 

at last joes job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped </s>
<s>  as joe
got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook
and <abvr> hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society </s>
<s>  but
mr </s>
<s>  wopsle said he would go if joe would </s>
<s>  joe said he was agreeable
and would take me if <abvr> joe approved </s>
<s>  we never should have got leave
to go i am sure but for <abvr> joes curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended </s>
<s>  as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy
back with his head blown to bits by a musket dont look to me to put it
together again </s>
<s> 

the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from <abvr>
pumblechook as from a comrade </s>
<s>  though i doubt if he were quite as fully
sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions as when
something moist was going </s>
<s>  his men resumed their muskets and fell in </s>
<s> 
mr </s>
<s>  wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes </s>
<s>  when we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably
whispered to joe i hope joe we shant find them </s>
<s>  and joe whispered
to me id give a shilling if they had cut and run pip </s>
<s> 

we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was
cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming
on and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day </s>
<s>  a
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came
out </s>
<s>  we passed the fingerpost and held straight on to the churchyard </s>
<s> 
there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeants
hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the
graves and also examined the porch </s>
<s>  they came in again without finding
anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate
at the side of the churchyard </s>
<s>  a bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind and joe took me on his back </s>
<s> 

now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should
come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who
had brought the soldiers there </s>
<s>  he had asked me if i was a deceiving
imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the
hunt against him </s>
<s>  would he believe that i was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest and had betrayed him </s>
<s> 

it was of no use asking myself this question now </s>
<s>  there i was on joes
back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a
hunter and stimulating <abvr> wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and
to keep up with us </s>
<s>  the soldiers were in front of us extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man </s>
<s>  we were taking
the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist </s>
<s> 
either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it </s>
<s> 
under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the
mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain
though all of a watery lead color </s>
<s> 

with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joes broad shoulder i
looked all about for any sign of the convicts </s>
<s>  i could see none i could
hear none </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his
blowing and hard breathing </s>
<s>  but i knew the sounds by this time and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit </s>
<s>  i got a dreadful
start when i thought i heard the file still going </s>
<s>  but it was only a
sheepbell </s>
<s>  the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us </s>
<s>  and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances </s>
<s>  but except
these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes </s>
<s> 

the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we
were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all
stopped </s>
<s>  for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a
long shout </s>
<s>  it was repeated </s>
<s>  it was at a distance towards the east but
it was long and loud </s>
<s>  nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
togetherif one might judge from a confusion in the sound </s>
<s> 

to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath when joe and i came up </s>
<s>  after another moments listening
joe who was a good judge agreed and <abvr> wopsle who was a bad judge
agreed </s>
<s>  the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not
be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men
should make towards it at the double </s>
<s>  so we slanted to the right
where the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to
hold on tight to keep my seat </s>
<s> 

it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he
spoke all the time a winder </s>
<s>  down banks and up banks and over gates
and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes </s>
<s>  no man cared
where he went </s>
<s>  as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice </s>
<s>  sometimes it
seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped </s>
<s>  when it broke
out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we
after them </s>
<s>  after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one
voice calling murder </s>
<s>  and another voice convicts </s>
<s>  runaways </s>
<s>  guard </s>
<s> 
this way for the runaway convicts </s>
<s>  then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle and then would break out again </s>
<s>  and when it had
come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too </s>
<s> 

the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two
of his men ran in close upon him </s>
<s>  their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in </s>
<s> 

here are both men </s>
<s>  panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a
ditch </s>
<s>  surrender you two </s>
<s>  and confound you for two wild beasts </s>
<s>  come
asunder </s>
<s> 

water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and
blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other
one </s>
<s>  both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling </s>
<s>  but
of course i knew them both directly </s>
<s> 

mind </s>
<s>  said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged
sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers </s>
<s>  i took him </s>
<s>  i give him
up to you </s>
<s>  mind that </s>
<s> 

its not much to be particular about said the sergeant </s>
<s>  itll do you
small good my man being in the same plight yourself </s>
<s>  handcuffs there </s>
<s> 

i dont expect it to do me any good </s>
<s>  i dont want it to do me more good
than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh </s>
<s>  i took him </s>
<s>  he
knows it </s>
<s>  thats enough for me </s>
<s> 

the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over </s>
<s> 
he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both
separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling </s>
<s> 

take notice guardhe tried to murder me were his first words </s>
<s> 

tried to murder him </s>
<s>  said my convict disdainfully </s>
<s>  try and not
do it </s>
<s>  i took him and giv him up </s>
<s>  thats what i done </s>
<s>  i not only
prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him heredragged
him this far on his way back </s>
<s>  hes a gentleman if you please this
villain </s>
<s>  now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me </s>
<s>  murder
him </s>
<s>  worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag
him back </s>
<s> 

the other one still gasped he triedhe triedtomurder me </s>
<s> 
bearbear witness </s>
<s> 

lookee here </s>
<s>  said my convict to the sergeant </s>
<s>  singlehanded i got
clear of the prisonship </s>
<s>  i made a dash and i done it </s>
<s>  i could ha got
clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg </s>
<s>  you wont find
much iron on itif i hadnt made the discovery that he was here </s>
<s>  let
him go free </s>
<s>  let him profit by the means as i found out </s>
<s>  let him make a
tool of me afresh and again </s>
<s>  once more </s>
<s>  no no no </s>
<s>  if i had died at
the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his
manacled hands id have held to him with that grip that you should
have been safe to find him in my hold </s>
<s> 

the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion repeated he tried to murder me </s>
<s>  i should have been a dead
man if you had not come up </s>
<s> 

he lies </s>
<s>  said my convict with fierce energy </s>
<s>  hes a liar born and
hell die a liar </s>
<s>  look at his face </s>
<s>  aint it written there </s>
<s>  let him turn
those eyes of his on me </s>
<s>  i defy him to do it </s>
<s> 

the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however
collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked
at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but
certainly did not look at the speaker </s>
<s> 

do you see him </s>
<s>  pursued my convict </s>
<s>  do you see what a villain he is </s>
<s> 
do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes </s>
<s>  thats how he looked
when we were tried together </s>
<s>  he never looked at me </s>
<s> 

the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with
a halftaunting glance at the bound hands </s>
<s>  at that point my convict
became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him
but for the interposition of the soldiers </s>
<s>  didnt i tell you said the
other convict then that he would murder me if he could </s>
<s>  and any one
could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his
lips curious white flakes like thin snow </s>
<s> 

enough of this parley said the sergeant </s>
<s>  light those torches </s>
<s> 

as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down
on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time
and saw me </s>
<s>  i had alighted from joes back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up and had not moved since </s>
<s>  i looked at him eagerly when
he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head </s>
<s>  i had
been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my
innocence </s>
<s>  it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended
my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it
all passed in a moment </s>
<s>  but if he had looked at me for an hour or for
a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having
been more attentive </s>
<s> 

the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four
torches and took one himself and distributed the others </s>
<s>  it had been
almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards
very dark </s>
<s>  before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in
a ring fired twice into the air </s>
<s>  presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river </s>
<s>  all right said the sergeant </s>
<s>  march </s>
<s> 

we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear </s>
<s>  you are expected
on board said the sergeant to my convict </s>
<s>  they know you are coming </s>
<s> 
dont straggle my man </s>
<s>  close up here </s>
<s> 

the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard </s>
<s> 
i had hold of joes hand now and joe carried one of the torches </s>
<s>  <abvr>
wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so
we went on with the party </s>
<s>  there was a reasonably good path now mostly
on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike
came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluicegate </s>
<s>  when
i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us </s>
<s>  the
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and
i could see those too lying smoking and flaring </s>
<s>  i could see nothing
else but black darkness </s>
<s>  our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets </s>
<s>  we could not go fast because
of their lameness </s>
<s>  and they were so spent that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested </s>
<s> 

after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landingplace </s>
<s>  there was a guard in the hut and they challenged
and the sergeant answered </s>
<s>  then we went into the hut where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and
a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once </s>
<s>  three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
greatcoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again </s>
<s>  the sergeant made some
kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i
call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board
first </s>
<s> 

my convict never looked at me except that once </s>
<s>  while we stood in the
hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up
his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he pitied them for their recent adventures </s>
<s>  suddenly he turned to the
sergeant and remarked

i wish to say something respecting this escape </s>
<s>  it may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me </s>
<s> 

you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly
looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it
here </s>
<s>  youll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it
before its done with you know </s>
<s> 

i know but this is another pint a separate matter </s>
<s>  a man cant
starve </s>
<s>  at least i cant </s>
<s>  i took some wittles up at the willage over
yonderwhere the church stands amost out on the marshes </s>
<s> 

you mean stole said the sergeant </s>
<s> 

and ill tell you where from </s>
<s>  from the blacksmiths </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said the sergeant staring at joe </s>
<s> 

halloa pip </s>
<s>  said joe staring at me </s>
<s> 

it was some broken wittlesthats what it wasand a dram of liquor
and a pie </s>
<s> 

have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith </s>
<s>  asked
the sergeant confidentially </s>
<s> 

my wife did at the very moment when you came in </s>
<s>  dont you know pip </s>
<s> 

so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and
without the least glance at meso youre the blacksmith are you </s>
<s> 
than im sorry to say ive eat your pie </s>
<s> 

god knows youre welcome to itso far as it was ever mine returned
joe with a saving remembrance of <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  we dont know what you have
done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable
fellowcreatur </s>
<s> would us pip </s>
<s> 

the something that i had noticed before clicked in the mans throat
again and he turned his back </s>
<s>  the boat had returned and his guard were
ready so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough stakes
and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself </s>
<s>  no one seemed surprised to see him or interested
in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way
you </s>
<s>  which was the signal for the dip of the oars </s>
<s>  by the light of the
torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore like a wicked noahs ark </s>
<s>  cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners </s>
<s>  we saw the boat go alongside and we saw
him taken up the side and disappear </s>
<s>  then the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with
him </s>

chapter vi

my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure </s>
<s>  but i hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it </s>
<s> 

i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to <abvr> joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me </s>
<s>  but
i loved joeperhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love himand as to him my inner self
was not so easily composed </s>
<s>  it was much upon my mind particularly when
i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe the
whole truth </s>
<s>  yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that
if i did he would think me worse than i was </s>
<s>  the fear of losing joes
confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my
tongue </s>
<s>  i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never
afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker
without thinking that he was meditating on it </s>
<s>  that if joe knew it i
never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterdays
meat or pudding when it came on todays table without thinking that he
was debating whether i had been in the pantry </s>
<s>  that if joe knew it and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his
beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it
would bring a rush of blood to my face </s>
<s>  in a word i was too cowardly
to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what i knew to be wrong </s>
<s>  i had had no intercourse with the world at
that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner </s>
<s>  quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of
action for myself </s>
<s> 

as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship joe took
me on his back again and carried me home </s>
<s>  he must have had a tiresome
journey of it for <abvr> wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad
temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself </s>

his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have
hanged him if it had been a capital offence </s>

by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having
been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues </s>

the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut

set at naughtnot to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood
with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out </s>

calculated to inspire confidence </s>

slumberous offence to the companys eyesight and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be

chapter vii

at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out </s>
<s>  my
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i
read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my fathers
exaltation to a better world </s>
<s>  and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family </s>
<s>  neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at
all accurate </s>
<s>  for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my
declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life
 laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwrights or up by the mill </s>
<s> 

when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could
assume that dignity i was not to be what <abvr> joe called pompeyed or
as i render it pampered </s>
<s>  therefore i was not only oddboy about the
forge but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favored with the
employment </s>
<s>  in order however that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby a moneybox was kept on the kitchen mantelshelf
into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped </s>
<s>  i have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure </s>

mr </s>
<s>  wopsles greataunt kept an evening school in the village </s>
<s>  that is
to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving
opportunity of seeing her do it </s>
<s>  she rented a small cottage and <abvr>
wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling </s>
<s>  there was a fiction that <abvr> wopsle examined
 the scholars once a quarter </s>
<s>  what he did on those occasions was to turn
up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antonys oration over
the body of caesar </s>
<s>  this was always followed by collinss ode on
the passions wherein i particularly venerated <abvr> wopsle as revenge
throwing his bloodstained sword in thunder down and taking the
wardenouncing trumpet with a withering look </s>
<s>  it was not with me then
as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions
and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen </s>

mr </s>

kept in the same rooma little general shop </s>
<s>  she had no idea what stock
she had or what the price of anything in it was </s>

greasy memorandumbook kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue
of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions </s>

biddy was <abvr> wopsles greataunts granddaughter </s>
<s>  i confess myself
quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was
to <abvr> wopsle </s>

<s>  like me too had been
brought up by hand </s>

her extremities </s>

wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel </s>

<s>  on
sundays she went to church elaborated </s>
<s> 

much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of <abvr>
wopsles greataunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramblebush </s>
<s>  getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter </s>
<s>  after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition </s>
<s>  but at last i began in a purblind groping way to
read write and cipher on the very smallest scale </s>
<s> 

one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to joe </s>
<s>  i think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long
time after and it was winter and a hard frost </s>

considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them

the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she
came along at a much brisker trot than usual </s>

drove up wrapped to the eyes </s>

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechooks premises in the high street of the market town

cornchandler and seedsman should be </s>

very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop </s>
<s>  and
i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the
tiedup brown paper packets inside whether the flowerseeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom </s>

speculation </s>

an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the

his shopman </s>

<s>  the same opportunity served me for noticing that <abvr>
pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the
street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping
his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his
hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded
his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist </s>
<s>  the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with

a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name </s>
<s>  to which my
conductor replied pumblechook </s>
<s>  the voice returned quite right and
the window was shut again and a young lady came across the courtyard
with keys in her hand </s>
<s> 

this said <abvr> pumblechook is pip </s>
<s> 

this is pip is it </s>
<s>  returned the young lady who was very pretty and
seemed very proud </s>
<s>  come in pip </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she said </s>
<s>  did you wish to see miss havisham </s>
<s> 

if miss havisham wished to see me returned <abvr> pumblechook
discomfited </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said the girl </s>
<s>  but you see she dont </s>
<s> 

she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that <abvr>
pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not
protest </s>
<s>  but he eyed me severelyas if i had done anything to
him </s>
<s> and departed with the words reproachfully delivered </s>
<s>  boy </s>
<s>  let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand </s>
<s> 
 i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound
through the gate and sixteen </s>
<s>  but he didnt </s>
<s> 

my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard </s>
<s> 
it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice </s>
<s>  the
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood
open away to the high enclosing wall </s>
<s>  and all was empty and disused </s>
<s> 
the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate </s>
<s>  and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea </s>
<s> 

she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt
all the strong beer thats brewed there now boy </s>
<s> 

i should think i could miss said i in a shy way </s>
<s> 

better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy </s>
<s> 
dont you think so </s>
<s> 

it looks like it miss </s>
<s> 

not that anybody means to try she added for thats all done with
and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls </s>
<s>  as to strong
beer theres enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor
house </s>
<s> 

is that the name of this house miss </s>
<s> 

one of its names boy </s>
<s> 

it has more than one then miss </s>
<s> 

one more </s>
<s>  its other name was satis </s>
<s>  which is greek or latin or
hebrew or all threeor all one to mefor enough </s>
<s> 

enough house said i </s>
<s>  thats a curious name miss </s>
<s> 

yes she replied </s>
<s>  but it meant more than it said </s>
<s>  it meant when it
was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else </s>
<s>  they
must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think </s>
<s>  but dont
loiter boy </s>
<s> 

though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary she was of about my own age </s>
<s>  she seemed much
older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and selfpossessed </s>
<s> 
and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneandtwenty and a
queen </s>
<s> 

we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two
chains across it outsideand the first thing i noticed was that the
passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there </s>
<s> 
she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase
and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us </s>
<s> 

at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in </s>
<s> 

i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss </s>
<s> 

to this she returned </s>
<s>  dont be ridiculous boy </s>
<s>  i am not going in </s>
<s>  and
scornfully walked away andwhat was worsetook the candle with her </s>
<s> 

this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid </s>
<s>  however the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told
from within to enter </s>
<s>  i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty
large room well lighted with wax candles </s>
<s>  no glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it </s>
<s>  it was a dressingroom as i supposed from the furniture
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me </s>
<s>  but
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookingglass and that
i made out at first sight to be a fine ladys dressingtable </s>
<s> 

whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it i cannot say </s>
<s>  in an armchair with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the
strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see </s>
<s> 

she was dressed in rich materialssatins and lace and silksall
of white </s>
<s>  her shoes were white </s>
<s>  and she had a long white veil dependent
from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was
white </s>
<s>  some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table </s>
<s>  dresses less splendid
than the dress she wore and halfpacked trunks were scattered about </s>
<s> 
she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe onthe
other was on the table near her handher veil was but half arranged
her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay
with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and
some flowers and a prayerbook all confusedly heaped about the
lookingglass </s>
<s> 

it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though
i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed </s>
<s>  but i
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been
white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow </s>
<s>  i saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and
like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her
sunken eyes </s>
<s>  i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone </s>
<s>  once i had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage
lying in state </s>
<s>  once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement </s>
<s>  now waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me </s>
<s>  i should have cried out if
i could </s>
<s> 

who is it </s>
<s>  said the lady at the table </s>
<s> 

pip maam </s>
<s> 

pip </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechooks boy maam </s>
<s>  cometo play </s>
<s> 

come nearer </s>
<s>  let me look at you </s>
<s>  come close </s>
<s> 

it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of
the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

look at me said miss havisham </s>
<s>  you are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born </s>
<s> 

i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer no </s>
<s> 

do you know what i touch here </s>
<s>  she said laying her hands one upon
the other on her left side </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  it made me think of the young man </s>
<s> 

what do i touch </s>
<s> 

your heart </s>
<s> 

broken </s>
<s> 

she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it </s>
<s>  afterwards she kept
her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy </s>
<s> 

i am tired said miss havisham </s>
<s>  i want diversion and i have done
with men and women </s>
<s>  play </s>
<s> 

i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances </s>
<s> 

i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy
that i want to see some play </s>
<s>  there there </s>
<s>  with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her right hand </s>
<s>  play play play </s>
<s> 

for a moment with the fear of my sisters working me before my eyes i
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of <abvr> pumblechooks chaisecart </s>
<s>  but i felt myself so unequal to the
performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in
what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when
we had taken a good look at each other

are you sullen and obstinate </s>
<s> 

no maam i am very sorry for you and very sorry i cant play just
now </s>
<s>  if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so
i would do it if i could </s>
<s>  but its so new here and so strange and so
fineand melancholy </s>
<s>  i stopped fearing i might say too much or
had already said it and we took another look at each other </s>
<s> 

before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the
dress she wore and at the dressingtable and finally at herself in the
lookingglass </s>
<s> 

so new to him she muttered so old to me </s>
<s>  so strange to him so
familiar to me </s>
<s>  so melancholy to both of us </s>
<s>  call estella </s>
<s> 

as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was
still talking to herself and kept quiet </s>
<s> 

call estella she repeated flashing a look at me </s>
<s>  you can do that </s>
<s> 
call estella </s>
<s>  at the door </s>
<s> 

to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house
bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost
as bad as playing to order </s>
<s>  but she answered at last and her light came
along the dark passage like a star </s>
<s> 

miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the
table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
pretty brown hair </s>
<s>  your own one day my dear and you will use it
well </s>
<s>  let me see you play cards with this boy </s>
<s> 

with this boy </s>
<s>  why he is a common laboring boy </s>
<s> 

i thought i overheard miss havisham answeronly it seemed so
unlikelywell </s>
<s>  you can break his heart </s>
<s> 

what do you play boy </s>
<s>  asked estella of myself with the greatest
disdain </s>
<s> 

nothing but beggar my neighbor miss </s>
<s> 

beggar him said miss havisham to estella </s>
<s>  so we sat down to cards </s>
<s> 

it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago </s>
<s>  i noticed that
miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had
taken it up </s>
<s>  as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressingtable
again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never
been worn </s>
<s>  i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent
and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been
trodden ragged </s>
<s>  without this arrest of everything this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like graveclothes or the long
veil so like a shroud </s>
<s> 

so she sat corpselike as we played at cards </s>
<s>  the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper </s>
<s>  i knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen </s>
<s>  but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust </s>
<s> 

he calls the knaves jacks this boy </s>
<s>  said estella with disdain before
our first game was out </s>
<s>  and what coarse hands he has </s>
<s>  and what thick
boots </s>
<s> 

i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before </s>
<s>  but i began
to consider them a very indifferent pair </s>
<s>  her contempt for me was so
strong that it became infectious and i caught it </s>
<s> 

she won the game and i dealt </s>
<s>  i misdealt as was only natural when i
knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong </s>
<s>  and she denounced me for
a stupid clumsy laboringboy </s>
<s> 

you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked
on </s>
<s>  she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her </s>
<s>  what
do you think of her </s>
<s> 

i dont like to say i stammered </s>
<s> 

tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down </s>
<s> 

i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think she is very pretty </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think she is very insulting </s>
<s>  she was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion </s>
<s> 

anything else </s>
<s> 

i think i should like to go home </s>
<s> 

and never see her again though she is so pretty </s>
<s> 

i am not sure that i shouldnt like to see her again but i should like
to go home now </s>
<s> 

you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud </s>
<s>  play the game out </s>
<s> 

saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost
sure that miss havishams face could not smile </s>
<s>  it had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expressionmost likely when all the things about
her had become transfixedand it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again </s>
<s>  her chest had dropped so that she stooped </s>
<s>  and her voice
had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her </s>
<s> 
altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul
within and without under the weight of a crushing blow </s>
<s> 

i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me </s>
<s>  she
threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she
despised them for having been won of me </s>
<s> 

when shall i have you here again </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  let me think </s>
<s> 

i was beginning to remind her that today was wednesday when she
checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her
right hand </s>
<s> 

there there </s>
<s>  i know nothing of days of the week </s>
<s>  i know nothing of
weeks of the year </s>
<s>  come again after six days </s>
<s>  you hear </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s> 

estella take him down </s>
<s>  let him have something to eat and let him roam
and look about him while he eats </s>
<s>  go pip </s>
<s> 

i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she
stood it in the place where we had found it </s>
<s>  until she opened the
side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must
necessarily be nighttime </s>
<s>  the rush of the daylight quite confounded me
and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours </s>
<s> 

you are to wait here you boy said estella </s>
<s>  and disappeared and
closed the door </s>
<s> 

i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots </s>
<s>  my opinion of those accessories was
not favorable </s>
<s>  they had never troubled me before but they troubled
me now as vulgar appendages </s>
<s>  i determined to ask joe why he had ever
taught me to call those picturecards jacks which ought to be called
knaves </s>
<s>  i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then
i should have been so too </s>
<s> 

she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer </s>
<s>  she
put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in
disgrace </s>
<s>  i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorryi
cannot hit upon the right name for the smartgod knows what its name
wasthat tears started to my eyes </s>
<s>  the moment they sprang there the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them </s>
<s> 
this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her </s>
<s>  so she gave a
contemptuous tossbut with a sense i thought of having made too sure
that i was so woundedand left me </s>
<s> 

but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face
in and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried </s>
<s> 
as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair </s>
<s>  so
bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that
needed counteraction </s>
<s> 

my sisters bringing up had made me sensitive </s>
<s>  in the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice </s>
<s>  it may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to </s>
<s>  but the child
is small and its world is small and its rockinghorse stands as many
hands high according to scale as a bigboned irish hunter </s>
<s>  within
myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with
injustice </s>
<s>  i had known from the time when i could speak that my
sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me </s>
<s>  i had
cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her
no right to bring me up by jerks </s>
<s>  through all my punishments disgraces
fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed
this assurance </s>
<s>  and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and
unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid
and very sensitive </s>
<s> 

i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my
face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate </s>
<s>  the bread and meat
were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon
in spirits to look about me </s>
<s> 

to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonhouse in the
breweryyard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it </s>
<s>  but there were no pigeons
in the dovecot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in
the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat </s>
<s> 
all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke </s>
<s>  in a byyard there was a wilderness of empty casks
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them </s>
<s>  but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was goneand in this respect i remember those recluses as being like
most others </s>
<s> 

behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old
wall </s>
<s>  not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked
there and that estella was walking away from me even then </s>
<s>  but she
seemed to be everywhere </s>
<s>  for when i yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks </s>
<s>  she had her back towards me and held her
pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round
and passed out of my view directly </s>
<s>  so in the brewery itselfby which
i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer
and where the brewing utensils still were </s>
<s>  when i first went into it
and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about
me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light
iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going
out into the sky </s>
<s> 

it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened
to my fancy </s>
<s>  i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards </s>
<s>  i turned my eyesa little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure
hanging there by the neck </s>
<s>  a figure all in yellow white with but
one shoe to the feet </s>
<s>  and it hung so that i could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was
miss havishams with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she were trying to call to me </s>
<s>  in the terror of seeing the figure
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it </s>
<s>  and my terror
was greatest of all when i found no figure there </s>
<s> 

nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought
me round </s>
<s>  even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon
as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let
me out </s>
<s>  she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i
thought if she saw me frightened </s>
<s>  and she would have no fair reason </s>
<s> 

she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the
gate and stood holding it </s>
<s>  i was passing out without looking at her
when she touched me with a taunting hand </s>
<s> 

why dont you cry </s>
<s> 

because i dont want to </s>
<s> 

you do said she </s>
<s>  you have been crying till you are half blind and
you are near crying again now </s>
<s> 

she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me </s>
<s> 
i went straight to <abvr> pumblechooks and was immensely relieved to find
him not at home </s>
<s>  so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was
wanted at miss havishams again i set off on the fourmile walk to
our forge </s>
<s>  pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply
revolving that i was a common laboringboy </s>
<s>  that my hands were coarse </s>
<s> 
that my boots were thick </s>
<s>  that i had fallen into a despicable habit
of calling knaves jacks </s>
<s>  that i was much more ignorant than i had
considered myself last night and generally that i was in a lowlived
bad way </s>
<s> 




chapter ix

when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss
havishams and asked a number of questions </s>
<s>  and i soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length </s>
<s> 

if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in minewhich i consider probable as i have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosityit is the key to many
reservations </s>
<s>  i felt convinced that if i described miss havishams as my
eyes had seen it i should not be understood </s>
<s>  not only that but i felt
convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood </s>
<s>  and although
she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before the
contemplation of <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  consequently i said as little as i could
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall </s>
<s> 

the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came
gaping over in his chaisecart at teatime to have the details divulged
to him </s>
<s>  and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth
open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence </s>
<s> 

well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire </s>
<s>  how did you get on up town </s>
<s> 

i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me </s>
<s> 

pretty well </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook repeated </s>
<s>  pretty well is no answer </s>
<s>  tell
us what you mean by pretty well boy </s>
<s> 

whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps </s>
<s>  anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my
obstinacy was adamantine </s>
<s>  i reflected for some time and then answered
as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well </s>
<s> 

my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at mei
had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forgewhen <abvr>
pumblechook interposed with no </s>
<s>  dont lose your temper </s>
<s>  leave this
lad to me maam </s>
<s>  leave this lad to me </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook then turned me
towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said

first to get our thoughts in order </s>
<s>  fortythree pence </s>
<s> 

i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and
finding them against me went as near the answer as i couldwhich was
somewhere about eightpence off </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook then put me through my
pencetable from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence
make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had
done for me now </s>
<s>  how much is fortythree pence </s>
<s>  to which i replied
after a long interval of reflection i dont know </s>
<s>  and i was so
aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me
and said is fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for
instance </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and
brought him to a dead stop </s>
<s> 

boy </s>
<s>  what like is miss havisham </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook began again when
he had recovered </s>
<s>  folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the
screw </s>
<s> 

very tall and dark i told him </s>
<s> 

is she uncle </s>
<s>  asked my sister </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook winked assent </s>
<s>  from which i at once inferred that he had
never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook conceitedly </s>
<s>  this is the way to have him </s>
<s> 
we are beginning to hold our own i think mum </s>
<s> 

i am sure uncle returned <abvr> joe i wish you had him always </s>
<s>  you
know so well how to deal with him </s>
<s> 

now boy </s>
<s>  what was she a doing of when you went in today </s>
<s>  asked <abvr>
pumblechook </s>
<s> 

she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook and <abvr> joe stared at one anotheras they well
mightand both repeated in a black velvet coach </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s>  and miss estellathats her niece i thinkhanded her
in cake and wine at the coachwindow on a gold plate </s>
<s>  and we all had
cake and wine on gold plates </s>
<s>  and i got up behind the coach to eat mine
because she told me to </s>
<s> 

was anybody else there </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

four dogs said i </s>
<s> 

large or small </s>
<s> 

immense said i </s>
<s>  and they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver
basket </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pumblechook and <abvr> joe stared at one another again in utter
amazement </s>
<s>  i was perfectly frantica reckless witness under the
tortureand would have told them anything </s>
<s> 

where was this coach in the name of gracious </s>
<s>  asked my sister </s>
<s> 

in miss havishams room </s>
<s>  they stared again </s>
<s>  but there werent any
horses to it </s>
<s>  i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of
harnessing </s>

can this be possible uncle </s>

ill tell you mum said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s>  my opinion is its a
sedanchair </s>
<s>  shes flighty you knowvery flightyquite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedanchair </s>
<s> 

did you ever see her in it uncle </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> joe </s>
<s> 

how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see
her in my life </s>
<s>  never clapped eyes upon her </s>
<s> 

goodness uncle </s>
<s>  and yet you have spoken to her </s>
<s> 

why dont you know said <abvr> pumblechook testily that when i have
been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door
has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way </s>
<s>  dont say you dont
know that mum </s>
<s>  howsever the boy went there to play </s>
<s>  what did you play
at boy </s>
<s> 

we played with flags i said </s>
<s>  i beg to observe that i think of myself
with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion </s>
<s> 

flags </s>
<s>  echoed my sister </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s>  estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and
miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out
at the coachwindow </s>
<s>  and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed </s>
<s> 

swords </s>
<s>  repeated my sister </s>
<s>  where did you get swords from </s>
<s> 

out of a cupboard said i </s>
<s>  and i saw pistols in itand jamand
pills </s>
<s>  and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up
with candles </s>
<s> 

thats true mum said <abvr> pumblechook with a grave nod </s>
<s>  thats the
state of the case for that much ive seen myself </s>
<s>  and then they
both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand </s>
<s> 

if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery </s>
<s>  they were so much occupied however in discussing the
marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped </s>
<s> 
the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup
of tea </s>
<s>  to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for
the gratification of his related my pretended experiences </s>
<s> 

now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence </s>
<s>  but only as
regarded himnot in the least as regarded the other two </s>
<s>  towards
joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat
debating what results would come to me from miss havishams acquaintance
and favor </s>
<s>  they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something
 for me </s>
<s>  their doubts related to the form that something would take </s>
<s> 
my sister stood out for property </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel tradesay
the corn and seed trade for instance </s>
<s>  joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealcutlets </s>
<s> 
if a fools head cant express better opinions than that said my
sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it </s>
<s> 
 so he went </s>
<s> 

after <abvr> pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up
i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for
the night </s>
<s>  then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to
tell you something </s>
<s> 

should you pip </s>
<s>  said joe drawing his shoeingstool near the forge </s>
<s> 
then tell us </s>
<s>  what is it pip </s>
<s> 

joe said i taking hold of his rolledup shirt sleeve and twisting
it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss
havishams </s>
<s> 

remember </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  i believe you </s>
<s>  wonderful </s>
<s> 

its a terrible thing joe </s>
<s>  it aint true </s>
<s> 

what are you telling of pip </s>
<s>  cried joe falling back in the greatest
amazement </s>
<s>  you dont mean to say its

yes i do </s>
<s>  its lies joe </s>
<s> 

but not all of it </s>
<s>  why sure you dont mean to say pip that there was
no black welwet coeh </s>
<s>  for i stood shaking my head </s>
<s>  but at least
there was dogs pip </s>
<s>  come pip said joe persuasively if there
warnt no wealcutlets at least there was dogs </s>
<s> 

no joe </s>
<s> 

a dog </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  a puppy </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

no joe there was nothing at all of the kind </s>
<s> 

as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay </s>
<s> 
pip old chap </s>
<s>  this wont do old fellow </s>
<s>  i say </s>
<s>  where do you expect to
go to </s>
<s> 

its terrible joe </s>
<s>  aint it </s>
<s> 

terrible </s>
<s>  cried joe </s>
<s>  awful </s>
<s>  what possessed you </s>
<s> 

i dont know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt
sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head </s>
<s> 
but i wish you hadnt taught me to call knaves at cards jacks </s>
<s>  and i
wish my boots werent so thick nor my hands so coarse </s>
<s> 

and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadnt been
able to explain myself to <abvr> joe and pumblechook who were so rude to
me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havishams
who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i
knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies
had come of it somehow though i didnt know how </s>
<s> 

this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal
with as for me </s>
<s>  but joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics and by that means vanquished it </s>
<s> 

theres one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some
rumination namely that lies is lies </s>
<s>  howsever they come they didnt
ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to
the same </s>
<s>  dont you tell no more of ˜em pip </s>
<s>  that aint the way to get
out of being common old chap </s>

it out at all clear </s>
<s>  you are oncommon in some things </s>

no i am ignorant and backward joe </s>

why see what a letter you wrote last night </s>

that </s>

well pip said joe be it so or be it sont you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope </s>

<s>  added joe with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z </s>
<s> 
and i know what that is to do though i cant say ive exactly done it </s>
<s> 

there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged
me </s>
<s> 

whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe
reflectively mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon
oneswhich reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps </s>
<s> 

no joe </s>
<s> 

im sorry there werent a flag pip </s>
<s>  whether that might be or
mightnt be is a thing as cant be looked into now without putting
your sister on the rampage </s>

being done intentional </s>

true friend </s>

be oncommon through going straight youll never get to do it through

you are not angry with me joe </s>

no old chap </s>

<s> 
thats all old chap and dont never do it no more </s>
<s> 

when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget
joes recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common
estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith </s>
<s>  how thick his boots and
how coarse his hands </s>
<s>  i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how
miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the
level of such common doings </s>
<s>  i fell asleep recalling what i used to
do when i was at miss havishams </s>
<s>  as though i had been there weeks or
months instead of hours </s>
<s>  and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day </s>
<s> 

that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me </s>
<s>  but it
is the same with any life </s>
<s>  imagine one selected day struck out of it

chapter x

the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke
that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of biddy everything she knew </s>
<s>  in pursuance of this luminous
conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to <abvr> wopsles greataunts
at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life
and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart
all her learning to me </s>
<s>  biddy who was the most obliging of girls
immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise
within five minutes </s>
<s> 

the educational scheme or course established by <abvr> wopsles greataunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis </s>
<s>  the pupils ate apples
and put straws down one anothers backs until <abvr> wopsles greataunt
collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birchrod </s>
<s>  after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand </s>
<s>  the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and
a little spellingthat is to say it had had once </s>
<s>  as soon as this
volume began to circulate <abvr> wopsles greataunt fell into a state of
coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm </s>
<s>  the pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes </s>
<s>  this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with
speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves </s>
<s>  this part of the course was
usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory
students </s>
<s>  when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a
page and then we all read aloud what we couldor what we couldntin
a frightful chorus </s>
<s>  biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice
and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we
were reading about </s>
<s>  when this horrible din had lasted a certain time
it mechanically awoke <abvr> wopsles greataunt who staggered at a boy
fortuitously and pulled his ears </s>
<s>  this was understood to terminate
the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory </s>
<s>  it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupils entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holdenand which was also <abvr> wopsles
greataunts sittingroom and bedchamberbeing but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle and no snuffers </s>
<s> 

it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under
these circumstances </s>
<s>  nevertheless i resolved to try it and that
very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some
information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist
sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d which she
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed
until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle </s>
<s> 

of course there was a publichouse in the village and of course joe
liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there </s>
<s>  i had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that
evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril </s>
<s>  to the
three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps </s>
<s> 

there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to
be never paid off </s>
<s>  they had been there ever since i could remember and
had grown more than i had </s>
<s>  but there was a quantity of chalk about our
country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account </s>
<s> 

it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records </s>
<s>  but as my business was with joe and not with him i
merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire
and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with <abvr> wopsle and a
stranger </s>
<s>  joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap </s>
<s>  and the
moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me </s>
<s> 

he was a secretlooking man whom i had never seen before </s>
<s>  his head was
all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun </s>
<s>  he had a pipe in his
mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time nodded </s>
<s>  so i nodded and then he
nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit
down there </s>
<s> 

but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of
resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made
for me on the opposite settle </s>
<s>  the strange man after glancing at joe
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again
when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his legin a very odd way as
it struck me </s>
<s> 

you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a
blacksmith </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i said it you know said joe </s>
<s> 

whatll you drink <abvr> </s>
<s>  you didnt mention your name by the bye </s>
<s> 

joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it </s>
<s>  whatll you
drink <abvr> gargery </s>
<s>  at my expense </s>
<s>  to top up with </s>
<s> 

well said joe to tell you the truth i aint much in the habit of
drinking at anybodys expense but my own </s>
<s> 

habit </s>
<s>  no returned the stranger but once and away and on a
saturday night too </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  put a name to it <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

i wouldnt wish to be stiff company said joe </s>
<s>  rum </s>
<s> 

rum repeated the stranger </s>
<s>  and will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment </s>
<s> 

rum said <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

three rums </s>
<s>  cried the stranger calling to the landlord </s>
<s>  glasses
round </s>
<s> 

this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing <abvr> wopsle
is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out </s>
<s>  our clerk at
church </s>
<s> 

aha </s>
<s>  said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me </s>
<s>  the
lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it </s>
<s> 

thats it said joe </s>
<s> 

the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself </s>
<s>  he wore a flapping
broadbrimmed travellers hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his
head in the manner of a cap </s>
<s>  so that he showed no hair </s>
<s>  as he looked
at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a
halflaugh come into his face </s>
<s> 

i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a
solitary country towards the river </s>
<s> 

most marshes is solitary said joe </s>
<s> 

no doubt no doubt </s>
<s>  do you find any gypsies now or tramps or
vagrants of any sort out there </s>
<s> 

no said joe </s>
<s>  none but a runaway convict now and then </s>
<s>  and we dont
find them easy </s>
<s>  eh <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented </s>
<s> 
but not warmly </s>
<s> 

seems you have been out after such </s>
<s>  asked the stranger </s>
<s> 

once returned joe </s>
<s>  not that we wanted to take them you understand </s>
<s> 
we went out as lookers on </s>
<s>  me and <abvr> wopsle and pip </s>
<s>  didnt us pip </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s> 

the stranger looked at me againstill cocking his eye as if he were
expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gunand said hes a
likely young parcel of bones that </s>
<s>  what is it you call him </s>
<s> 

pip said joe </s>
<s> 

christened pip </s>

no not christened pip </s>
<s> 

surname pip </s>

no said joe its a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
infant and is called by </s>
<s> 

son of yours </s>
<s> 

well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at
the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipeswellno </s>
<s>  no he aint </s>
<s> 

nevvy </s>
<s>  said the strange man </s>
<s> 

well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he
is notno not to deceive you he is notmy nevvy </s>
<s> 

what the blue blazes is he </s>
<s>  asked the stranger </s>
<s>  which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wopsle struck in upon that </s>
<s>  as one who knew all about relationships
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry </s>
<s>  and expounded the ties between me and joe </s>
<s>  having
his hand in <abvr> wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite
enough to account for it when he added as the poet says </s>
<s> 

and here i may remark that when <abvr> wopsle referred to me he considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes </s>
<s>  i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances </s>
<s>  yet i do not call to mind that i
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle but some largehanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me </s>
<s> 

all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at
me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me
down </s>
<s>  but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation
until the glasses of rum and water were brought </s>
<s>  and then he made his
shot and a most extraordinary shot it was </s>
<s> 

it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbshow and was
pointedly addressed to me </s>
<s>  he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me
and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me </s>
<s>  and he stirred it and
he tasted it </s>
<s>  not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file </s>
<s> 

he did this so that nobody but i saw the file </s>
<s>  and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket </s>
<s>  i knew it to be
joes file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the
instrument </s>
<s>  i sat gazing at him spellbound </s>
<s>  but he now reclined on his
settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about
turnips </s>
<s> 

there was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which
stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays
than at other times </s>
<s>  the halfhour and the rum and water running out
together joe got up to go and took me by the hand </s>
<s> 

stop half a moment <abvr> gargery said the strange man </s>
<s>  i think ive
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy
shall have it </s>
<s> 

he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some
crumpled paper and gave it to me </s>
<s>  yours </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  your own </s>
<s> 

i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners
and holding tight to joe </s>
<s>  he gave joe goodnight and he gave <abvr> wopsle
goodnight who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his
aiming eyeno not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it </s>
<s> 

on the way home if i had been in a humor for talking the talk must
have been all on my side for <abvr> wopsle parted from us at the door of
the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible </s>
<s>  but i was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance and could think of nothing else </s>
<s> 

my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her about the bright shilling </s>
<s>  a bad un ill be bound said <abvr> joe
triumphantly or he wouldnt have given it to the boy </s>
<s>  lets look at
it </s>
<s> 

i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one </s>
<s>  but whats
this </s>
<s>  said <abvr> joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper </s>
<s>  two onepound notes </s>
<s> 

nothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets in
the county </s>
<s>  joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly
bargemen to restore them to their owner </s>
<s>  while he was gone i sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there </s>
<s> 

presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he
joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes </s>
<s> 
then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under
some dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor </s>
<s>  there they remained a nightmare to me many and many
a night and day </s>
<s> 

i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
convictsa feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten </s>
<s> 
i was haunted by the file too </s>
<s>  a dread possessed me that when i least
expected it the file would reappear </s>
<s>  i coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of miss havishams next wednesday </s>
<s>  and in my sleep i saw
the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i
screamed myself awake </s>
<s> 




chapter xi

at the appointed time i returned to miss havishams and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out estella </s>
<s>  she locked it after admitting
me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her candle stood </s>
<s>  she took no notice of me until she had the
candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously
saying you are to come this way today and took me to quite another
part of the house </s>
<s> 

the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the manor house </s>
<s>  we traversed but one side of the square
however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and
opened a door </s>
<s>  here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in
a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwellinghouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery </s>
<s>  there was a clock in the
outer wall of this house </s>
<s>  like the clock in miss havishams room and
like miss havishams watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling on the groundfloor at the back </s>
<s>  there was some company in
the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and
stand there boy till you are wanted </s>
<s>  there being the window i
crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind
looking out </s>
<s> 

it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks and one boxtree
that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new
growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different color as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt </s>
<s>  this
was my homely thought as i contemplated the boxtree </s>
<s>  there had been
some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge </s>
<s> 
but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window
as if it pelted me for coming there </s>
<s> 

i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that
its other occupants were looking at me </s>
<s>  i could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the windowglass but i stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection </s>
<s> 

there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman </s>
<s>  before i had been
standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs </s>
<s>  because the admission
that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady
and humbug </s>
<s> 

they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodys pleasure
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn </s>
<s>  this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded
me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found
when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features </s>
<s>  indeed when
i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features
at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face </s>
<s> 

poor dear soul </s>
<s>  said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my
sisters </s>
<s>  nobodys enemy but his own </s>
<s> 

it would be much more commendable to be somebody elses enemy said
the gentleman </s>
<s>  far more natural </s>
<s> 

cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbor </s>
<s> 

sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own
neighbor who is </s>
<s> 

miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn
the idea </s>
<s>  but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too </s>
<s>  the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and
emphatically very true </s>
<s> 

poor soul </s>
<s>  camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time he is so very strange </s>

idea </s>

good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond </s>

you know i was obliged said camillai was obliged to be firm </s>

without deep trimmings the family was disgraced </s>

breakfast till dinner </s>

<s> 

its not the question my dear child who paid for them returned
camilla </s>
<s>  i bought them </s>
<s>  and i shall often think of that with peace
when i wake up in the night </s>
<s> 

the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation
and caused estella to say to me now boy </s>
<s>  on my turning round they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard
sarah pocket say well i am sure </s>
<s>  what next </s>
<s>  and camilla add with
indignation was there ever such a fancy </s>
<s>  the idea </s>
<s> 

as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped
all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with
her face quite close to mine

well </s>
<s> 

well miss </s>
<s>  i answered almost falling over her and checking myself </s>
<s> 

she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her </s>
<s> 

am i pretty </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i think you are very pretty </s>
<s> 

am i insulting </s>
<s> 

not so much so as you were last time said i </s>
<s> 

not so much so </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s> 

she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with
such force as she had when i answered it </s>
<s> 

now </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  you little coarse monster what do you think of me
now </s>
<s> 

i shall not tell you </s>
<s> 

because you are going to tell upstairs </s>
<s>  is that it </s>
<s> 

no said i thats not it </s>
<s> 

why dont you cry again you little wretch </s>
<s> 

because ill never cry for you again said i </s>
<s>  which was i suppose as
false a declaration as ever was made </s>
<s>  for i was inwardly crying for her
then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards </s>
<s> 

we went on our way upstairs after this episode </s>
<s>  and as we were going
up we met a gentleman groping his way down </s>
<s> 

whom have we here </s>
<s>  asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me </s>
<s> 

a boy said estella </s>
<s> 

he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an
exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand </s>
<s>  he took my chin
in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle </s>
<s>  he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling </s>
<s> 
his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious </s>
<s>  he had a large watchchain and strong black dots where his
beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them </s>
<s>  he was nothing
to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be
anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing
him well </s>
<s> 

boy of the neighborhood </s>
<s>  hey </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

yes sir said i </s>
<s> 

how do you come here </s>
<s> 

miss havisham sent for me sir i explained </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  behave yourself </s>
<s>  i have a pretty large experience of boys and
youre a bad set of fellows </s>
<s>  now mind </s>
<s>  said he biting the side of his
great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself </s>
<s> 

with those words he released mewhich i was glad of for his hand
smelt of scented soapand went his way downstairs </s>
<s>  i wondered whether
he could be a doctor </s>
<s>  but no i thought </s>
<s>  he couldnt be a doctor or he
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner </s>
<s>  there was not much time
to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havishams room where
she and everything else were just as i had left them </s>
<s>  estella left me
standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her
eyes upon me from the dressingtable </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  she said without being startled or surprised </s>
<s>  the days have worn
away have they </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  today is

there there there </s>
<s>  with the impatient movement of her fingers </s>
<s>  i
dont want to know </s>
<s>  are you ready to play </s>
<s> 

i was obliged to answer in some confusion i dont think i am maam </s>
<s> 

not at cards again </s>
<s>  she demanded with a searching look </s>
<s> 

yes maam </s>
<s>  i could do that if i was wanted </s>
<s> 

since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham
impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work </s>
<s> 

i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to
find for the other question and i said i was quite willing </s>
<s> 

then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind
me with her withered hand and wait there till i come </s>
<s> 

i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated </s>
<s> 
from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive </s>
<s>  a fire had been lately kindled in
the damp oldfashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer airlike our own marsh mist </s>
<s>  certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber </s>
<s>  or it
would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness </s>
<s>  it was
spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces </s>
<s>  the
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together </s>
<s>  an epergne or centrepiece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth </s>
<s>  it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable </s>
<s>  and as i looked along the yellow
expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black
fungus i saw specklelegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community </s>
<s> 

i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests </s>
<s>  but the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way as if they were shortsighted and hard of hearing and not
on terms with one another </s>
<s> 

these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching
them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder </s>
<s> 
in her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned and
she looked like the witch of the place </s>
<s> 

this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i
will be laid when i am dead </s>
<s>  they shall come and look at me here </s>
<s> 

with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and
there and die at once the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the fair i shrank under her touch </s>
<s> 

what do you think that is </s>
<s>  she asked me again pointing with her
stick </s>
<s>  that where those cobwebs are </s>
<s> 

i cant guess what it is maam </s>
<s> 

its a great cake </s>
<s>  a bridecake </s>
<s>  mine </s>
<s> 

she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come </s>
<s> 
walk me walk me </s>
<s> 

i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss
havisham round and round the room </s>
<s>  accordingly i started at once and
she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of <abvr>
pumblechooks chaisecart </s>
<s> 

she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower </s>
<s> 
 still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast </s>
<s>  after a
while she said call estella </s>
<s>  so i went out on the landing and
roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion </s>
<s>  when her light
appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round
and round the room </s>
<s> 

if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should
have felt sufficiently discontented </s>
<s>  but as she brought with her the
three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didnt know
what to do </s>
<s>  in my politeness i would have stopped </s>
<s>  but miss
havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted onwith a shamefaced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing </s>
<s> 

dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket </s>
<s>  how well you look </s>
<s> 

i do not returned miss havisham </s>
<s>  i am yellow skin and bone </s>
<s> 

camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff </s>
<s>  and she
murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear
soul </s>
<s>  certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing </s>
<s>  the idea </s>
<s> 

and how are you </s>
<s>  said miss havisham to camilla </s>
<s>  as we were close to
camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss
havisham wouldnt stop </s>
<s>  we swept on and i felt that i was highly
obnoxious to camilla </s>
<s> 

thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be
expected </s>
<s> 

why whats the matter with you </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham with exceeding
sharpness </s>
<s> 

nothing worth mentioning replied camilla </s>
<s>  i dont wish to make a
display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the
night than i am quite equal to </s>
<s> 

then dont think of me retorted miss havisham </s>
<s> 

very easily said </s>
<s>  remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a
hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed </s>
<s>  raymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night </s>
<s> 
raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs </s>
<s>  chokings
and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with
anxiety of those i love </s>
<s>  if i could be less affectionate and sensitive
i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves </s>
<s>  i am sure
i wish it could be so </s>
<s>  but as to not thinking of you in the nightthe
idea </s>
<s>  here a burst of tears </s>
<s> 

the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and
him i understood to be <abvr> camilla </s>
<s>  he came to the rescue at this point
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other </s>
<s> 

i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but
once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person my dear </s>
<s> 

miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated
old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnutshells
and a large mouth like a cats without the whiskers supported this
position by saying no indeed my dear </s>
<s>  hem </s>
<s> 

thinking is easy enough said the grave lady </s>
<s> 

what is easier you know </s>
<s>  assented miss sarah pocket </s>
<s> 

oh yes yes </s>
<s>  cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her legs to her bosom </s>
<s>  its all very true </s>
<s>  its a weakness
to be so affectionate but i cant help it </s>
<s>  no doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise still i wouldnt change my disposition
if i could </s>
<s>  its the cause of much suffering but its a consolation to
know i posses it when i wake up in the night </s>
<s>  here another burst of
feeling </s>
<s> 

miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going
round and round the room </s>
<s>  now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber </s>
<s> 

theres matthew </s>
<s>  said camilla </s>
<s>  never mixing with any natural ties
never coming here to see how miss havisham is </s>
<s>  i have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head
over the side and my hair all down and my feet i dont know where

much higher than your head my love said <abvr> camilla </s>
<s> 

i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of
matthews strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me </s>
<s> 

really i must say i should think not </s>
<s>  interposed the grave lady </s>
<s> 

you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious
personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to
thank you my love </s>
<s> 

without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed
camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond
is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the pianoforte
tuners across the street where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distanceand now to be told
 here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there </s>
<s> 

when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and
herself and stood looking at the speaker </s>
<s>  this change had a great
influence in bringing camillas chemistry to a sudden end </s>
<s> 

matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly
when i am laid on that table </s>
<s>  that will be his placethere striking
the table with her stick at my head </s>
<s>  and yours will be there </s>
<s>  and your
husbands there </s>
<s>  and sarah pockets there </s>
<s>  and georgianas there </s>
<s>  now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me </s>
<s> 
and now go </s>
<s> 

at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in
a new place </s>
<s>  she now said walk me walk me </s>
<s>  and we went on again </s>
<s> 

i suppose theres nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply
and depart </s>
<s>  its something to have seen the object of ones love and
duty for even so short a time </s>
<s>  i shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when i wake up in the night </s>
<s>  i wish matthew could have
that comfort but he sets it at defiance </s>
<s>  i am determined not to make a
display of my feelings but its very hard to be told one wants to feast
on ones relationsas if one was a giantand to be told to go </s>
<s>  the
bare idea </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  camilla interposing as <abvr> camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth </s>
<s>  sarah
pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last </s>
<s>  but sarah was
too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence </s>
<s>  sarah
pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss
havisham dear </s>
<s>  and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnutshell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest </s>
<s> 

while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly </s>
<s>  at last she
stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it
some seconds

this is my birthday pip </s>
<s> 

i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick </s>
<s> 

i dont suffer it to be spoken of </s>
<s>  i dont suffer those who were here
just now or any one to speak of it </s>
<s>  they come here on the day but they
dare not refer to it </s>
<s> 

of course i made no further effort to refer to it </s>
<s> 

on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of
decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table but not touching it was brought here </s>
<s>  it and i have worn away
together </s>
<s>  the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me </s>
<s> 

she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking
at the table </s>
<s>  she in her once white dress all yellow and withered </s>
<s>  the
once white cloth all yellow and withered </s>
<s>  everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch </s>
<s> 

when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when
they lay me dead in my brides dress on the brides tablewhich shall
be done and which will be the finished curse upon himso much the
better if it is done on this day </s>
<s> 

she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
lying there </s>
<s>  i remained quiet </s>
<s>  estella returned and she too remained
quiet </s>
<s>  it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time </s>
<s>  in
the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might
presently begin to decay </s>
<s> 

at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an
instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards </s>
<s>  why have
you not begun </s>
<s>  with that we returned to her room and sat down as
before </s>
<s>  i was beggared as before </s>
<s>  and again as before miss havisham
watched us all the time directed my attention to estellas beauty and
made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estellas breast and
hair </s>
<s> 

estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she
did not condescend to speak </s>
<s>  when we had played some halfdozen games
a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former doglike manner </s>
<s>  there too i was again left to
wander about as i liked </s>
<s> 

it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last
occasion open or shut </s>
<s>  enough that i saw no gate then and that i
saw one now </s>
<s>  as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let
the visitors outfor she had returned with the keys in her handi
strolled into the garden and strolled all over it </s>
<s>  it was quite a
wilderness and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan </s>
<s> 

when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallendown grapevine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal
corner upon which i had looked out of the window </s>
<s>  never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window
and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair </s>
<s> 

this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me </s>
<s> 
he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i
now saw that he was inky </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he young fellow </s>
<s> 

halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to
be best answered by itself i said halloa </s>
<s>  politely omitting young
fellow </s>
<s> 

who let you in </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

miss estella </s>
<s> 

who gave you leave to prowl about </s>
<s> 

miss estella </s>
<s> 

come and fight said the pale young gentleman </s>
<s> 

what could i do but follow him </s>
<s>  i have often asked myself the question
since </s>
<s>  but what else could i do </s>
<s>  his manner was so final and i was
so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a
spell </s>
<s> 

stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many
paces </s>
<s>  i ought to give you a reason for fighting too </s>
<s>  there it is </s>
<s> 
 in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one
another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair
slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach </s>
<s> 

the bulllike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat </s>
<s>  i therefore hit out
at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha </s>
<s>  would you </s>
<s> 
 and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled
within my limited experience </s>
<s> 

laws of the game </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  here he skipped from his left leg on to
his right </s>
<s>  regular rules </s>
<s>  here he skipped from his right leg on to
his left </s>
<s>  come to the ground and go through the preliminaries </s>
<s>  here
he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i
looked helplessly at him </s>
<s> 

i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous </s>
<s>  but i felt
morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention </s>
<s>  therefore i
followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish </s>
<s>  on his asking me
if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar </s>
<s>  available for both he said
placing these against the wall </s>
<s>  and then fell to pulling off not
only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once
lighthearted businesslike and bloodthirsty </s>
<s> 

although he did not look very healthyhaving pimples on his face and
a breaking out at his mouththese dreadful preparations quite appalled
me </s>
<s>  i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance </s>
<s>  for
the rest he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded
for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him as to development </s>
<s> 

my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were
minutely choosing his bone </s>
<s>  i never have been so surprised in my life
as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his
back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
foreshortened </s>
<s> 

but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again </s>
<s>  the second greatest
surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again
looking up at me out of a black eye </s>
<s> 

his spirit inspired me with great respect </s>
<s>  he seemed to have no
strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down </s>
<s> 
but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out
of the waterbottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he really was going to do for me at last </s>
<s>  he got heavily
bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i
hit him </s>
<s>  but he came up again and again and again until at last he got
a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall </s>
<s>  even after that
crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times not knowing where i was </s>
<s>  but finally went on his knees to his
sponge and threw it up </s>
<s>  at the same time panting out that means you
have won </s>
<s> 

he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the
contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory </s>
<s>  indeed i go
so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast </s>
<s>  however i got dressed darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you </s>
<s> 
 and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same
to you </s>
<s> 

when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys </s>
<s> 
but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her
waiting </s>
<s>  and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something
had happened to delight her </s>
<s>  instead of going straight to the gate too
she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me </s>
<s> 

come here </s>
<s>  you may kiss me if you like </s>
<s> 

i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me </s>
<s>  i think i would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek </s>
<s>  but i felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and
that it was worth nothing </s>
<s> 

what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with
the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black nightsky and joes furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road </s>
<s> 




chapter xii

my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman </s>
<s>  the
more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me </s>
<s>  i felt that
the pale young gentlemans blood was on my head and that the law would
avenge it </s>
<s>  without having any definite idea of the penalties i had
incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe
punishment </s>
<s>  for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon
me </s>
<s>  the pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers and i tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night </s>
<s>  i had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentlemans teeth and i twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before
the judges </s>
<s> 

when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence my terrors reached their height </s>
<s>  whether myrmidons of justice
specially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the
gate </s>
<s> whether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her house might rise in those graveclothes of hers
draw a pistol and shoot me dead </s>
<s> whether suborned boysa numerous
band of mercenariesmight be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery
and cuff me until i was no more </s>
<s> it was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him
accessory to these retaliations </s>
<s>  they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features </s>
<s> 

however go to miss havishams i must and go i did </s>
<s>  and behold </s>
<s>  nothing
came of the late struggle </s>
<s>  it was not alluded to in any way and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises </s>
<s>  i found the same
gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house </s>
<s>  but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within and all was lifeless </s>
<s>  only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young
gentlemans existence </s>
<s>  there were traces of his gore in that spot and i

<s> 

on the broad landing between miss havishams own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out i saw a gardenchaira
light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind </s>
<s>  it had been placed
there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular
occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of
walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across
the landing and round the other room </s>
<s>  over and over and over again
we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch </s>
<s>  i insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months </s>
<s> 

as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more
to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was
i going to be </s>
<s>  i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i
believed </s>
<s>  and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end </s>
<s>  but she did not </s>
<s>  on the contrary she seemed to prefer my
being ignorant </s>
<s>  neither did she ever give me any moneyor anything
but my daily dinnernor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my
services </s>
<s> 

estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told
me i might kiss her again </s>
<s>  sometimes she would coldly tolerate me </s>
<s> 
sometimes she would condescend to me </s>
<s>  sometimes she would be quite
familiar with me </s>
<s>  sometimes she would tell me energetically that she
hated me </s>
<s>  miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were
alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip </s>
<s>  and when i said yes
for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily </s>
<s>  also when we
played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of
estellas moods whatever they were </s>
<s>  and sometimes when her moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what
to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness
murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my
pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy </s>
<s> 

there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the
burden was old clem </s>
<s>  this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation
towards smiths </s>
<s>  it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clems
respected name </s>
<s>  thus you were to hammer boys roundold clem </s>

thump and a soundold clem </s>
<s>  beat it out beat it outold clem </s>
<s>  with a
clink for the stoutold clem </s>
<s>  blow the fire blow the fireold
clem </s>
<s>  roaring dryer soaring higherold clem </s>
<s>  one day soon after the
appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the
impatient movement of her fingers there there there </s>
<s>  sing </s>
<s>  i was
surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor </s>
<s>  it
happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep </s>
<s>  after that it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often
join in </s>
<s>  though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were
three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind </s>
<s> 

what could i become with these surroundings </s>
<s>  how could my character fail
to be influenced by them </s>
<s>  is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms </s>
<s> 

perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
i had confessed </s>
<s>  under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach </s>
<s>  therefore i said nothing of him </s>
<s> 
besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed
which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time
went on </s>
<s>  i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy </s>
<s>  but i told
poor biddy everything </s>
<s>  why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy
had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though
i think i know now </s>
<s> 

meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit </s>
<s>  that ass
pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister </s>
<s>  and i really do believe to
this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart they would have done
it </s>
<s>  the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that
he could not discuss my prospects without having me before himas it
were to operate uponand he would drag me up from my stool usually
by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the
fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum
here is this boy </s>
<s>  here is this boy which you brought up by hand </s>
<s>  hold up
your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do </s>
<s>  now
mum with respections to this boy </s>
<s>  and then he would rumple my hair
the wrong waywhich from my earliest remembrance as already hinted
i have in my soul denied the right of any fellowcreature to doand
would hold me before him by the sleevea spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself </s>
<s> 

then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me
that i used to wantquite painfullyto burst into spiteful tears fly
at pumblechook and pummel him all over </s>
<s>  in these dialogues my sister
spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference </s>
<s>  while pumblechook himself selfconstituted my patron
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job </s>
<s> 

in these discussions joe bore no part </s>
<s>  but he was often talked at
while they were in progress by reason of <abvr> joes perceiving that
he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge </s>
<s>  i was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to joe </s>
<s>  and when joe sat with the poker on
his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his
hands shake him and put it away </s>
<s>  there was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates </s>
<s>  all in a moment with nothing to lead up to
it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come </s>
<s>  theres enough of
you </s>
<s>  you get along to bed </s>
<s>  youve given trouble enough for one night i
hope </s>
<s>  as if i had besought them as a favor to bother my life out </s>
<s> 

we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss
havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my
shoulder </s>
<s>  and said with some displeasure

you are growing tall pip </s>
<s> 

i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control </s>
<s> 

she said no more at the time </s>
<s>  but she presently stopped and looked at me
again </s>
<s>  and presently again </s>
<s>  and after that looked frowning and moody </s>
<s> 
on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and
i had landed her at her dressingtable she stayed me with a movement of
her impatient fingers </s>
<s> 

tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours </s>
<s> 

joe gargery maam </s>
<s> 

meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to </s>
<s> 

yes miss havisham </s>
<s> 

you had better be apprenticed at once </s>
<s>  would gargery come here with
you and bring your indentures do you think </s>
<s> 

i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be
asked </s>
<s> 

then let him come </s>
<s> 

at any particular time miss havisham </s>
<s> 

there there </s>
<s>  i know nothing about times </s>
<s>  let him come soon and come
along with you </s>
<s> 

when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister
went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period </s>
<s>  she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was doormats under
our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously
thought she was fit for </s>
<s>  when she had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing
got out the dustpanwhich was always a very bad signput on her
coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent </s>
<s>  not satisfied
with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush and cleaned
us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the backyard </s>
<s> 
it was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again and
then she asked joe why he hadnt married a negress slave at once </s>
<s> 
joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and
looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a
better speculation </s>
<s> 




chapter xiii

it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see
joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss
havishams </s>
<s>  however as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the
occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his
workingdress </s>
<s>  the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled
up his shirtcollar so very high behind that it made the hair on the
crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers </s>
<s> 

at breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with
us and being left at uncle pumblechooks and called for when we had
done with our fine ladiesa way of putting the case from which joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst </s>
<s>  the forge was shut up for the day
and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable
hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he had taken </s>
<s> 

we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited
straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it
was a fine bright day </s>
<s>  i am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously </s>
<s>  but i rather think they were
displayed as articles of propertymuch as cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
procession </s>
<s> 

when we came to pumblechooks my sister bounced in and left us </s>
<s>  as it
was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havishams house </s>
<s> 
estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took
his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands </s>
<s>  as if
he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce </s>
<s> 

estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew
so well </s>
<s>  i followed next to her and joe came last </s>
<s>  when i looked back
at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the
greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his toes </s>
<s> 

estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coatcuff
and conducted him into miss havishams presence </s>
<s>  she was seated at her
dressingtable and looked round at us immediately </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said she to joe </s>
<s>  you are the husband of the sister of this boy </s>
<s> 

i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird </s>
<s>  standing as he did speechless with his
tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm </s>
<s> 

you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this
boy </s>
<s> 

it was very aggravating </s>
<s>  but throughout the interview joe persisted in
addressing me instead of miss havisham </s>
<s> 

which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great
politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time
what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  and you have reared the boy with the
intention of taking him for your apprentice </s>
<s>  is that so <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it
were looked forard to betwixt us as being calclated to lead to
larks </s>
<s>  not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the
businesssuch as its being open to black and sut or suchlikenot
but what they would have been attended to dont you see </s>
<s> 

has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection </s>
<s>  does he
like the trade </s>
<s> 

which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening
his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that
it were the wish of your own hart </s>
<s>  i saw the idea suddenly break upon
him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on
to say and there werent no objection on your part and pip it were
the great wish of your hart </s>
<s> 

it was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he
ought to speak to miss havisham </s>
<s>  the more i made faces and gestures
to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he
persisted in being to me </s>
<s> 

have you brought his indentures with you </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham </s>
<s> 

well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little
unreasonable you yourself see me put ˜em in my ˜at and therefore you
know as they are here </s>
<s>  with which he took them out and gave them not
to miss havisham but to me </s>
<s>  i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good
fellowi know i was ashamed of himwhen i saw that estella stood
at the back of miss havishams chair and that her eyes laughed
mischievously </s>
<s>  i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
miss havisham </s>
<s> 

you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium
with the boy </s>
<s> 

joe </s>
<s>  i remonstrated for he made no reply at all </s>
<s>  why dont you
answer

pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me and which you know the answer to be full well no </s>
<s>  you know it to
be no pip and wherefore should i say it </s>
<s> 

miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there </s>
<s>  and took
up a little bag from the table beside her </s>
<s> 

pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is </s>
<s>  there are
fiveandtwenty guineas in this bag </s>
<s>  give it to your master pip </s>
<s> 

as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass
persisted in addressing me </s>
<s> 

this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such
received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near
nor nowheres </s>
<s>  and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation
first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to miss havishamand now old chap may we
do our duty </s>
<s>  may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another
and by them which your liberal presenthaveconweyedto befor the
satisfaction of mindofthem as never here joe showed that he felt
he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued
himself with the words and from myself far be it </s>
<s>  these words had
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice </s>
<s> 

goodbye pip </s>
<s>  said miss havisham </s>
<s>  let them out estella </s>
<s> 

am i to come again miss havisham </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  gargery is your master now </s>
<s>  gargery </s>
<s>  one word </s>
<s> 

thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe
in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and
that is his reward </s>
<s>  of course as an honest man you will expect no
other and no more </s>
<s> 

how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine </s>
<s>  but
i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs
instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went
after him and laid hold of him </s>
<s>  in another minute we were outside the
gate and it was locked and estella was gone </s>
<s>  when we stood in the
daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me
astonishing </s>
<s>  and there he remained so long saying astonishing at
intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming
back </s>
<s>  at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this
is astonishing </s>
<s>  and so by degrees became conversational and able to
walk away </s>
<s> 

i have reason to think that joes intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechooks
he invented a subtle and deep design </s>
<s>  my reason is to be found in
what took place in <abvr> pumblechooks parlor </s>
<s>  where on our presenting
ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  cried my sister addressing us both at once </s>
<s>  and whats
happened to you </s>
<s>  i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
society as this i am sure i do </s>
<s> 

miss havisham said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of
remembrance made it wery partickler that we should give herwere it
compliments or respects pip </s>

which that were my own belief answered joe </s>

its better late than never </s>

my sister looked at pumblechook </s>
<s>  who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
armchair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all
about it beforehand </s>
<s> 

and how much have you got </s>
<s>  asked my sister laughing </s>
<s>  positively
laughing </s>
<s> 

what would present company say to ten pound </s>
<s>  demanded joe </s>
<s> 

theyd say returned my sister curtly pretty well </s>
<s>  not too much
but pretty well </s>
<s> 

its more than that then said joe </s>
<s> 

that fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he
rubbed the arms of his chair its more than that mum </s>
<s> 

why you dont mean to say began my sister </s>
<s> 

yes i do mum said pumblechook </s>
<s>  but wait a bit </s>
<s>  go on joseph </s>
<s>  good
in you </s>
<s>  go on </s>
<s> 

what would present company say proceeded joe to twenty pound </s>
<s> 

handsome would be the word returned my sister </s>
<s> 

well then said joe its more than twenty pound </s>
<s> 

that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a
patronizing laugh its more than that mum </s>
<s>  good again </s>
<s>  follow her up
joseph </s>
<s> 

then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my
sister </s>
<s>  its fiveandtwenty pound </s>
<s> 

its fiveandtwenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers
pumblechook rising to shake hands with her </s>
<s>  and its no more than your
merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy of the
money </s>
<s> 

if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently
awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody
with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far
behind </s>
<s> 

now you see joseph and wife said pumblechook as he took me by the
arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with
what theyve begun </s>
<s>  this boy must be bound out of hand </s>
<s>  thats my way </s>
<s> 
bound out of hand </s>
<s> 

goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the
money were deeply beholden to you </s>
<s> 

never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler </s>
<s>  a
pleasures a pleasure all the world over </s>
<s>  but this boy you know </s>
<s>  we
must have him bound </s>
<s>  i said id see to itto tell you the truth </s>
<s> 

the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial
presence </s>
<s>  i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook
exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick </s>
<s>  indeed
it was the general impression in court that i had been taken redhanded </s>
<s> 
for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some
people say whats he done </s>
<s>  and others hes a young ˜un too but
looks bad dont he </s>
<s>  one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters and entitled to be read in my
cell </s>
<s> 

the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a
churchand with people hanging over the pews looking onand with
mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with
folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading
the newspapersand with some shining black portraits on the walls
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
stickingplaster </s>
<s>  here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested and i was bound </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little
preliminaries disposed of </s>
<s> 

when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me we went back to pumblechooks </s>
<s>  and there my sister
became so excited by the twentyfive guineas that nothing would serve
her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and
that pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart and bring the hubbles
and <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 

it was agreed to be done </s>
<s>  and a most melancholy day i passed </s>
<s>  for
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole
company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment </s>
<s>  and to make it
worse they all asked me from time to timein short whenever they
had nothing else to dowhy i didnt enjoy myself </s>
<s>  and what could i
possibly do then but say i was enjoying myselfwhen i wasnt </s>
<s> 

however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the
most of it </s>
<s>  that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table </s>
<s> 
and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i
played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair
beside him to illustrate his remarks </s>
<s> 

my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldnt
let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself </s>
<s>  that rather late in the evening <abvr> wopsle
gave us collinss ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder
down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials
underneath sent up their compliments and it wasnt the tumblers arms </s>
<s> 
 that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o
lady fair </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about
everybodys private affairs that he was the man with his white locks
flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going </s>
<s> 

finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly
wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like
joes trade </s>
<s>  i had liked it once but once was not now </s>

chapter xiv

it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home </s>
<s>  there may be black
ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved </s>
<s>  but that it is a miserable thing i can testify </s>
<s> 

home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sisters
temper </s>
<s>  but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it </s>
<s>  i had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon </s>
<s>  i had believed
in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls </s>
<s>  i had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment </s>
<s> 
i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence </s>
<s>  within a single year all this was changed </s>
<s>  now it was all
coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella
see it on any account </s>
<s> 

how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault
how much miss havishams how much my sisters is now of no moment to
me or to any one </s>
<s>  the change was made in me </s>
<s>  the thing was done </s>
<s>  well or
ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done </s>
<s> 

once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my
shirtsleeves and go into the forge joes ˜prentice i should be
distinguished and happy </s>
<s>  now the reality was in my hold i only felt
that i was dusty with the dust of smallcoal and that i had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather </s>
<s>  there have
been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more </s>
<s> 
never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to joe </s>
<s> 

i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about
the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea </s>
<s>  i was quite
as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that
aftertime </s>
<s>  but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe
while my indentures lasted </s>
<s>  it is about the only thing i am glad to know
of myself in that connection </s>
<s> 

for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i
proceed to add was joes </s>
<s>  it was not because i was faithful but because
joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor </s>
<s>  it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of

what i wanted who can say </s>

i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and

would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing
the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me </s>

often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were
singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss
havishams would seem to show me estellas face in the fire with her
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning meoften at
such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just
drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last </s>

after that when we went into supper the place and the meal would have

chapter xv

as i was getting too big for <abvr> wopsles greataunts room my
education under that preposterous female terminated </s>

biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue
of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny </s>

although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were
the opening lines </s>

     wasnt i done very brown sirs </s>
<s> 
     too rul loo rul
     too rul loo rul

still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity </s>
<s>  nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i
thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry </s>
<s>  in my hunger for information i made proposals to <abvr> wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied </s>
<s> 
as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic
layfigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon
declined that course of instruction </s>
<s>  though not until <abvr> wopsle in his
poetic fury had severely mauled me </s>
<s> 

whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe </s>
<s>  this statement sounds so
well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained </s>
<s>  i wanted
to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my
society and less open to estellas reproach </s>
<s> 

the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken
slate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational implements </s>
<s> 
to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco </s>
<s>  i never knew joe to
remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my
tuition any piece of information whatever </s>
<s>  yet he would smoke his pipe
at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere elseeven
with a learned airas if he considered himself to be advancing
immensely </s>
<s>  dear fellow i hope he did </s>
<s> 

it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water </s>
<s>  whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and
estella </s>

or sail or green hillside or waterline it was just the same </s>
<s> miss
havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque </s>
<s> 

one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on
being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of
miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the
water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head </s>
<s> 

joe said i </s>
<s>  dont you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit </s>
<s> 

well pip returned joe slowly considering </s>
<s>  what for </s>
<s> 

what for joe </s>
<s>  what is any visit made for </s>
<s> 

there is some wisits praps said joe as for ever remains open to
the question pip </s>
<s>  but in regard to wisiting miss havisham </s>
<s>  she might
think you wanted somethingexpected something of her </s>
<s> 

dont you think i might say that i did not joe </s>
<s> 

you might old chap said joe </s>
<s>  and she might credit it </s>
<s>  similarly she
mightnt </s>
<s> 

joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard
at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition </s>
<s> 

you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss
havisham done the handsome thing by you </s>
<s>  when miss havisham done the
handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were
all </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>

<s> 

all joe repeated very emphatically </s>

yes joe </s>

which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning weremake a
end on it </s>
<s> as you was </s>
<s> me to the north and you to the south </s>
<s> keep in
sunders </s>
<s> 

i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he had thought of it </s>

probable </s>
<s> 

but joe </s>
<s> 

yes old chap </s>
<s> 

here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day
of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after
her or shown that i remember her </s>

thats true pip </s>
<s>  and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes

i dont mean that sort of remembrance joe </s>
<s>  i dont mean a present </s>

but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it </s>
<s> 
or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain
for the front dooror say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for
general useor some light fancy article such as a toastingfork
when she took her muffinsor a gridiron when she took a sprat or such
like

i dont mean any present at all joe i interposed </s>

well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly
pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldnt </s>
<s>  no i would not </s>
<s>  for
whats a doorchain when shes got one always up </s>

open to misrepresentations </s>
<s>  and if it was a toastingfork youd go into
brass and do yourself no credit </s>
<s>  and the oncommonest workman cant show
himself oncommon in a gridironfor a gridiron is a gridiron said
joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but
a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave
and you cant help yourself

my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat dont
go on in that way </s>
<s>  i never thought of making miss havisham any present </s>
<s> 

no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all
along </s>
<s>  and what i say to you is you are right pip </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s>  but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack
just now if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow i think i would
go uptown and make a call on miss esthavisham </s>
<s> 

which her name said joe gravely aint estavisham pip unless she
have been rechrisened </s>
<s> 

i know joe i know </s>
<s>  it was a slip of mine </s>
<s>  what do you think of it
joe </s>
<s> 

in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of
it </s>
<s>  but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received
with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received then this experimental trip should have no successor </s>
<s>  by
these conditions i promised to abide </s>
<s> 

now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick </s>
<s> 
he pretended that his christian name was dolgea clear
impossibilitybut he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i
believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding </s>
<s>  he was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of
great strength never in a hurry and always slouching </s>
<s>  he never even
seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere
accident </s>
<s>  and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or
went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew
as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever
coming back </s>
<s>  he lodged at a sluicekeepers out on the marshes and on
workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back </s>
<s>  on sundays he mostly lay all day on the
sluicegates or stood against ricks and barns </s>
<s>  he always slouched
locomotively with his eyes on the ground </s>
<s>  and when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a halfresentful
halfpuzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking </s>
<s> 

this morose journeyman had no liking for me </s>
<s>  when i was very small and
timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner
of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well </s>
<s>  also that it was
necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and
that i might consider myself fuel </s>
<s>  when i became joes ˜prentice orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him </s>
<s> 
howbeit he liked me still less </s>
<s>  not that he ever said anything or did
anything openly importing hostility </s>
<s>  i only noticed that he always beat
his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came
in out of time </s>
<s> 

dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of
my halfholiday </s>
<s>  he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows </s>
<s>  but by
and by he said leaning on his hammer

now master </s>
<s>  sure youre not a going to favor only one of us </s>
<s>  if young
pip has a halfholiday do as much for old orlick </s>
<s>  i suppose he was
about fiveandtwenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person </s>
<s> 

why whatll you do with a halfholiday if you get it </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s> 

whatll i do with it </s>
<s>  whatll he do with it </s>
<s>  ill do as much with it as
him said orlick </s>
<s> 

as to pip hes going up town said joe </s>
<s> 

well then as to old orlick hes a going up town retorted that
worthy </s>
<s>  two can go up town </s>
<s>  taint only one wot can go up town </s>
<s> 

dont lose your temper said joe </s>

shall if i like growled orlick </s>
<s>  some and their uptowning </s>
<s>  now
master </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  no favoring in this shop </s>
<s>  be a man </s>
<s> 

the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a redhot
bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body
whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it outas
if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting bloodand
finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he
again leaned on his hammer

now master </s>
<s> 

are you all right now </s>
<s>  demanded joe </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i am all right said gruff old orlick </s>
<s> 

then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said
joe let it be a halfholiday for all </s>
<s> 

my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearingshe was
a most unscrupulous spy and listenerand she instantly looked in at
one of the windows </s>
<s> 

like you you fool </s>
<s>  said she to joe giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that </s>
<s>  you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in
that way </s>

youd be everybodys master if you durst retorted orlick with an
illfavored grin </s>

let her alone said joe </s>
<s> 

id be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage </s>

match for the noodles without being a match for your master whos the
dunderheaded king of the noodles </s>

rogues without being a match for you who are the blackestlooking and
the worst rogue between this and france </s>

youre a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman </s>

<s>  what did he call me
with my husband standing by </s>

<s>  oh </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  each of these exclamations was
a shriek </s>
<s>  and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all
the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for
her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it and became blindly furious by regular stages </s>
<s>  what was the
name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  hold me </s>
<s> 
oh </s>
<s> 

ahhh </s>
<s>  growled the journeyman between his teeth id hold you if
you was my wife </s>
<s>  id hold you under the pump and choke it out of you </s>
<s> 

i tell you let her alone said joe </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  to hear him </s>

scream togetherwhich was her next stage </s>

giving me </s>
<s>  that orlick </s>
<s>  in my own house </s>
<s>  me a married woman </s>
<s>  with my
husband standing by </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  here my sister after a fit of clappings
and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and
threw her cap off and pulled her hair downwhich were the last stages
on her road to frenzy </s>
<s>  being by this time a perfect fury and a complete
success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked </s>
<s> 

what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical
interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant
by interfering betwixt himself and <abvr> joe </s>
<s>  and further whether he was
man enough to come on </s>
<s>  old orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway </s>
<s>  so
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went
at one another like two giants </s>
<s>  but if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man </s>
<s>  orlick as if he
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very
soon among the coaldust and in no hurry to come out of it </s>
<s>  then joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible
at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was
carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joes hair </s>

then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars </s>
<s>  and
then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such
a lullnamely that it was sunday and somebody was deadi went upstairs
to dress myself </s>

when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlicks nostrils
which was neither expressive nor ornamental </s>
<s>  a pot of beer had appeared
from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner </s>
<s>  the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation
that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage
pip </s>
<s> such is life </s>
<s> 

with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to

the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnutshell countenance i
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with

as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman
who should come out of the bookshop but <abvr> wopsle </s>

his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that

thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short

mere question of length and wearisomeness </s>

identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self </s>

pains to present me in the worst light </s>

millwood put me down in argument on every occasion </s>

in effect we had not walked many yards further when the

a good night for cutting off in said orlick </s>

chapter xvi

with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe
that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at
all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under
obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else </s>
<s>  but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i
took another view of the case which was more reasonable </s>
<s> 

joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a
quarter after eight oclock to a quarter before ten </s>
<s>  while he was there
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged
good night with a farmlaborer going home </s>
<s>  the man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense
confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine </s>
<s> 
when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down
on the floor and promptly called in assistance </s>
<s>  the fire had not then
burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long </s>
<s>  the
candle however had been blown out </s>
<s> 

nothing had been taken away from any part of the house </s>
<s>  neither beyond
the blowing out of the candlewhich stood on a table between the door
and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was
struckwas there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such
as she herself had made in falling and bleeding </s>
<s>  but there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot </s>
<s>  she had been struck with
something blunt and heavy on the head and spine </s>
<s>  after the blows were
dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
violence as she lay on her face </s>
<s>  and on the ground beside her when joe
picked her up was a convicts legiron which had been filed asunder </s>
<s> 

now joe examining this iron with a smiths eye declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago </s>
<s>  the hue and cry going off to the
hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joes opinion
was corroborated </s>
<s>  they did not undertake to say when it had left the
prisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged </s>
<s>  but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night </s>
<s>  further one of
those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron </s>
<s> 

knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here </s>
<s>  i believed
the iron to be my convicts ironthe iron i had seen and heard him
filing at on the marshesbut my mind did not accuse him of having put
it to its latest use </s>
<s>  for i believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account </s>
<s> 
either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file </s>
<s> 

now as to orlick </s>
<s>  he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the
evening he had been in divers companies in several publichouses and
he had come back with myself and <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s>  there was nothing against
him save the quarrel </s>
<s>  and my sister had quarrelled with him and with
everybody else about her ten thousand times </s>
<s>  as to the strange man </s>
<s>  if
he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute
about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them </s>
<s> 
besides there had been no altercation </s>
<s>  the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look
round </s>
<s> 

it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however
undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise </s>
<s>  i suffered unspeakable
trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story </s>
<s>  for
months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the
negative and reopened and reargued it next morning </s>
<s>  the contention
came after all to this </s>
<s> the secret was such an old one now had so
grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it
away </s>
<s>  in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he
believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe
it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets as a
monstrous invention </s>
<s>  however i temporized with myself of coursefor
was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always
done </s>
<s> and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant </s>
<s> 

the constables and the bow street men from londonfor this happened in
the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for
a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases </s>
<s>  they took up several obviously
wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances </s>
<s>  also they stood
about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration </s>
<s>  and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as
taking the culprit </s>
<s>  but not quite for they never did it </s>
<s> 

long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very
ill in bed </s>
<s>  her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities </s>
<s>  her hearing was greatly impaired </s>
<s>  her memory also </s>
<s>  and her
speech was unintelligible </s>
<s>  when at last she came round so far as to
be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in
speech </s>
<s>  as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent
speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary
complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve </s>
<s> 
the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of
tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own
mistakes </s>
<s> 

however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient </s>
<s>  a
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three
months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind </s>
<s>  we were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsles greataunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a
part of our establishment </s>
<s> 

it may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the
kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household </s>
<s> 
above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had
been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me
every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine
figure of a woman as she once were pip </s>
<s>  biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy </s>
<s>  joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life
and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did
him good </s>
<s>  it was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered </s>
<s> 

biddys first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me </s>
<s>  i had tried hard at it but had made
nothing of it </s>
<s>  thus it was </s>
<s> 

again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a
character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted </s>
<s>  i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t
from tar to toast and tub </s>
<s>  at length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my
sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent </s>
<s>  thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after
another but without avail </s>
<s>  then i bethought me of a crutch the shape
being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence </s>
<s>  but she shook her head to
that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her
weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck </s>
<s> 

when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate </s>
<s>  biddy looked thoughtfully
at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked
thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his
initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me </s>
<s> 

why of course </s>
<s>  cried biddy with an exultant face </s>
<s>  dont you see </s>
<s> 
its him </s>
<s> 

orlick without a doubt </s>
<s>  she had lost his name and could only signify
him by his hammer </s>
<s>  we told him why we wanted him to come into the
kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his
arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching
out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him </s>
<s> 

i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i
was disappointed by the different result </s>
<s>  she manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his
being at length produced and motioned that she would have him
given something to drink </s>
<s>  she watched his countenance as if she were
particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception
she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master </s>
<s>  after that day a day rarely
passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks
slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more
than i did what to make of it </s>

chapter xvii

i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to miss havisham </s>
<s>  i found miss sarah pocket still on duty
at the gate </s>
<s>  i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke
of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words </s>
<s>  the
interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was
going and told me to come again on my next birthday </s>
<s>  i may mention at
once that this became an annual custom </s>
<s>  i tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her
to ask me very angrily if i expected more </s>
<s>  then and after that i took
it </s>
<s> 

so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened
room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass that
i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that
mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew
older it stood still </s>
<s>  daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact </s>
<s>  it
bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home </s>
<s> 

imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however </s>
<s>  her
shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were
always clean </s>
<s>  she was not beautifulshe was common and could not be
like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered </s>
<s> 
she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one
evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes </s>
<s>  eyes that
were very pretty and very good </s>
<s> 

it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring
atwriting some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagemand seeing biddy observant of what i was
about </s>
<s>  i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without
laying it down </s>
<s> 

biddy said i how do you manage it </s>
<s>  either i am very stupid or you
are very clever </s>
<s> 

what is it that i manage </s>
<s>  i dont know returned biddy smiling </s>
<s> 

she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too </s>
<s>  but i did not
mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising </s>
<s> 

how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn
and always to keep up with me </s>
<s>  i was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the
greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment </s>
<s>  though i have no
doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price </s>
<s> 

i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see
me turning to at it </s>
<s>  but you never turn to at it biddy </s>
<s> 

i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly </s>
<s>  and went
on with her sewing </s>
<s> 

pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at
biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather
an extraordinary girl </s>
<s>  for i called to mind now that she was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different
sorts of work and our various tools </s>
<s>  in short whatever i knew biddy
knew </s>
<s>  theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or
better </s>
<s> 

you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every
chance </s>
<s>  you never had a chance before you came here and see how
improved you are </s>
<s> 

biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing </s>
<s>  i was
your first teacher though </s>
<s>  wasnt i </s>
<s>  said she as she sewed </s>
<s> 

biddy </s>
<s>  i exclaimed in amazement </s>
<s>  why you are crying </s>
<s> 

no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing </s>
<s>  what put that in
your head </s>
<s> 

what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work </s>
<s>  i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been
until <abvr> wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people </s>
<s>  i recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered </s>
<s>  i reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first
uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of
course </s>
<s>  biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i
looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps
i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy </s>
<s>  i might have been too
reserved and should have patronized her more though i did not use that
precise word in my meditations with my confidence </s>
<s> 

yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my
first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this in this kitchen </s>
<s> 

ah poor thing </s>
<s>  replied biddy </s>
<s>  it was like her selfforgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her
making her more comfortable </s>
<s>  thats sadly true </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do </s>
<s> 
and i must consult you a little more as i used to do </s>
<s>  let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat </s>
<s> 

my sister was never left alone now </s>
<s>  but joe more than readily undertook
the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out
together </s>
<s>  it was summertime and lovely weather </s>
<s>  when we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to
combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way </s>
<s> 
when we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank with the water
rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of biddy into my inner confidence </s>
<s> 

biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a
gentleman </s>
<s> 

o i wouldnt if i was you </s>
<s>  she returned </s>
<s>  i dont think it would
answer </s>
<s> 

biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman </s>
<s> 

you know best pip </s>
<s>  but dont you think you are happier as you are </s>
<s> 

biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am </s>
<s>  i
am disgusted with my calling and with my life </s>
<s>  i have never taken to
either since i was bound </s>
<s>  dont be absurd </s>
<s> 

was i absurd </s>
<s>  said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows </s>
<s>  i am sorry
for that </s>
<s>  i didnt mean to be </s>
<s>  i only want you to do well and to be
comfortable </s>
<s> 

well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be
comfortableor anything but miserablethere biddy </s>
<s> unless i can lead
a very different sort of life from the life i lead now </s>
<s> 

thats a pity </s>
<s>  said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air </s>
<s> 

now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her
sentiment and my own </s>
<s>  i told her she was right and i knew it was much
to be regretted but still it was not to be helped </s>
<s> 

if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short
grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wallif i could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was
little i know it would have been much better for me </s>
<s>  you and i and joe
would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone
partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to
keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
sunday quite different people </s>
<s>  i should have been good enough for you </s>
<s> 
shouldnt i biddy </s>
<s> 

biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for
answer yes </s>
<s>  i am not overparticular </s>
<s>  it scarcely sounded flattering
but i knew she meant well </s>
<s> 

instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two see how i am going on </s>
<s>  dissatisfied and uncomfortable andwhat
would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me
so </s>
<s> 

biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more
attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships </s>
<s> 

it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she
remarked directing her eyes to the ships again </s>
<s>  who said it </s>
<s> 

i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where
i was going to </s>
<s>  it was not to be shuffled off now however and i
answered the beautiful young lady at miss havishams and shes more
beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want
to be a gentleman on her account </s>
<s>  having made this lunatic confession
i began to throw my tornup grass into the river as if i had some
thoughts of following it </s>
<s> 

do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over </s>
<s>  biddy
quietly asked me after a pause </s>
<s> 

i dont know i moodily answered </s>
<s> 

because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should thinkbut
you know bestthat might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her words </s>
<s>  and if it is to gain her over i should
thinkbut you know bestshe was not worth gaining over </s>
<s> 

exactly what i myself had thought many times </s>
<s>  exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment </s>
<s>  but how could i a poor dazed
village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day </s>
<s> 

it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her
dreadfully </s>
<s> 

in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well </s>
<s>  all the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced
that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i
had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot </s>
<s> 

biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me </s>
<s> 
she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work
upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair </s>
<s> 
then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face
upon my sleeve i cried a littleexactly as i had done in the brewery
yardand felt vaguely convinced that i was very much illused by
somebody or by everybody </s>
<s>  i cant say which </s>
<s> 

i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt
you could give me your confidence pip </s>
<s>  and i am glad of another thing
and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it </s>
<s>  if your first teacher dear </s>
<s>  such a poor
one and so much in need of being taught herself </s>
<s>  had been your teacher
at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set </s>
<s>  but
it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and its
of no use now </s>
<s>  so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank
and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a
little farther or go home </s>
<s> 

biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving
her a kiss i shall always tell you everything </s>
<s> 

till youre a gentleman said biddy </s>
<s> 

you know i never shall be so thats always </s>
<s>  not that i have any
occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i knowas i
told you at home the other night </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships </s>
<s> 
and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a
little farther or go home </s>
<s> 

i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very
beautiful </s>
<s>  i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing
beggar my neighbor by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks
and being despised by estella </s>
<s>  i thought it would be very good for me if
i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do
and stick to it and make the best of it </s>
<s>  i asked myself the question
whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that
moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable </s>
<s>  i was obliged to
admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip
what a fool you are </s>
<s> 

we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed
right </s>
<s>  biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy today and
somebody else tomorrow </s>
<s>  she would have derived only pain and no
pleasure from giving me pain </s>
<s>  she would far rather have wounded her own
breast than mine </s>
<s>  how could it be then that i did not like her much
the better of the two </s>
<s> 

biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me
right </s>
<s> 

i wish i could </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s> 

if i could only get myself to fall in love with youyou dont mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance </s>
<s> 

oh dear not at all </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  dont mind me </s>
<s> 

if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me </s>
<s> 

but you never will you see said biddy </s>
<s> 

it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before </s>
<s>  i therefore observed
i was not quite sure of that </s>
<s>  but biddy said she was and she said it
decisively </s>
<s>  in my heart i believed her to be right </s>
<s>  and yet i took it
rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point </s>
<s> 

when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and
get over a stile near a sluicegate </s>
<s>  there started up from the gate or
from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way
old orlick </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  he growled where are you two going </s>
<s> 

where should we be going but home </s>
<s> 

well then said he im jiggered if i dont see you home </s>
<s> 

this penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his </s>
<s>  he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but
used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging </s>
<s>  when i was younger i
had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook </s>
<s> 

biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper
dont let him come </s>
<s>  i dont like him </s>
<s>  as i did not like him either
i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnt want
seeing home </s>
<s>  he received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little
distance </s>
<s> 

curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account i asked her why she did not like him </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us
because ii am afraid he likes me </s>
<s> 

did he ever tell you he liked you </s>
<s>  i asked indignantly </s>
<s> 

no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me
so </s>
<s>  but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye </s>
<s> 

however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation </s>
<s>  i was very hot indeed upon
old orlicks daring to admire her </s>
<s>  as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself </s>
<s> 

but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly </s>
<s> 

no biddy it makes no difference to me </s>
<s>  only i dont like it </s>
<s>  i dont
approve of it </s>
<s> 

nor i neither said biddy </s>
<s>  though that makes no difference to you </s>
<s> 

exactly said i </s>
<s>  but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you
biddy if he danced at you with your own consent </s>
<s> 

i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances
were favorable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that
demonstration </s>
<s>  he had struck root in joes establishment by reason
of my sisters sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him
dismissed </s>
<s>  he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i
had reason to know thereafter </s>
<s> 

and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated
its confusion fifty thousandfold by having states and seasons when i
was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the
plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect
and happiness </s>
<s>  at those times i would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company
with biddywhen all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter
my wits again </s>
<s>  scattered wits take a long time picking up </s>
<s>  and often
before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out </s>
<s> 

if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities i dare say </s>
<s>  it never did run out however but was brought
to a premature end as i proceed to relate </s>
<s> 




chapter xviii

it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a
saturday night </s>
<s>  there was a group assembled round the fire at the three
jolly bargemen attentive to <abvr> wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud </s>
<s> 
of that group i was one </s>
<s> 

a highly popular murder had been committed and <abvr> wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows </s>
<s>  he gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description and identified himself with every witness at the
inquest </s>
<s>  he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he
barbarously bellowed ill serve you out as the murderer </s>
<s>  he gave the
medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner </s>
<s>  and
he piped and shook as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness </s>
<s>  the coroner in <abvr> wopsles hands became
timon of athens </s>
<s>  the beadle coriolanus </s>
<s>  he enjoyed himself thoroughly
and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable </s>
<s>  in this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder </s>
<s> 

then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me looking on </s>
<s>  there was an expression
of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
watched the group of faces </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said the stranger to <abvr> wopsle when the reading was done you
have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt </s>
<s> 

everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer </s>
<s>  he looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically </s>

guilty of course </s>

in a confirmatory murmur </s>

certainly i know it replied <abvr> wopsle </s>

ask you another questiontaking possession of <abvr> wopsle as if he

mr </s>

him </s>

mr </s>

ill help you </s>

what is it </s>

is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner the printed paper you have just been reading from </s>

undoubtedly </s>

undoubtedly </s>
<s>  now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers
instructed him altogether to reserve his defence </s>

i read that just now <abvr> wopsle pleaded </s>

never mind what you read just now sir </s>

subterfuge </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  have you found it </s>

here it is said <abvr> wopsle </s>

now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence </s>

you make that of it </s>

mr </s>

not the exact words </s>

exact substance </s>

yes said <abvr> wopsle </s>

yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company
with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle </s>
<s>  and now i ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage

pronounced a fellowcreature guilty unheard </s>

we all began to suspect that <abvr> wopsle was not the man we had thought
him and that he was beginning to be found out </s>
<s> 

and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his
finger at <abvr> wopsle heavilythat same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself
might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his
pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the
issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the
bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help
him god </s>

we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too
far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet
time </s>

the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose

the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went </s>

you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip </s>

i am here </s>

the stranger did not recognize me but i recognized him as the gentleman
i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss
havisham </s>

and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder
i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his
deepset eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watchchain his
strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented
soap on his great hand </s>

i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had
surveyed me at his leisure </s>

had better go to your place of residence </s>

communication here </s>

please to your friends afterwards </s>

amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen
and in a wondering silence walked home </s>
<s>  while going along the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of
his finger </s>
<s>  as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door </s>
<s> 
our conference was held in the state parlor which was feebly lighted by
one candle </s>
<s> 

it began with the strange gentlemans sitting down at the table drawing
the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocketbook </s>
<s> 
he then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little aside after
peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was
which </s>
<s> 

my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london </s>
<s>  i am
pretty well known </s>
<s>  i have unusual business to transact with you and i
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating </s>

see me here </s>
<s>  what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i
do </s>
<s>  no less no more </s>
<s> 

finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got
up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it </s>

having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground </s>
<s> 

now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice </s>
<s>  you would not object to cancel his
indentures at his request and for his good </s>
<s>  you would want nothing for
so doing </s>
<s> 

lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pips way
 said joe staring </s>
<s> 

lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned <abvr>
jaggers </s>
<s>  the question is would you want anything </s>
<s>  do you want
anything </s>
<s> 

the answer is returned joe sternly no </s>
<s> 

i thought <abvr> jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for
his disinterestedness </s>
<s>  but i was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise to be sure of it </s>
<s> 

very well said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  recollect the admission you have made
and dont try to go from it presently </s>
<s> 

whos a going to try </s>
<s>  retorted joe </s>
<s> 

i dont say anybody is </s>
<s>  do you keep a dog </s>
<s> 

yes i do keep a dog </s>
<s> 

bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better </s>
<s> 
bear that in mind will you </s>
<s>  repeated <abvr> jaggers shutting his eyes
and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something </s>
<s> 
now i return to this young fellow </s>
<s>  and the communication i have got to
make is that he has great expectations </s>
<s> 

joe and i gasped and looked at one another </s>
<s> 

i am instructed to communicate to him said <abvr> jaggers throwing
his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property </s>
<s> 
further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life
and from this place and be brought up as a gentlemanin a word as a
young fellow of great expectations </s>
<s> 

my dream was out </s>
<s>  my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality </s>
<s>  miss
havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have
to say to you </s>
<s>  you are to understand first that it is the request
of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear
the name of pip </s>
<s>  you will have no objection i dare say to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition </s>
<s>  but if you have
any objection this is the time to mention it </s>
<s> 

my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears
that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  now you are to understand secondly <abvr> pip that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret until the person chooses to reveal it </s>
<s>  i am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself </s>
<s>  when or where that intention may be carried
out i cannot say </s>
<s>  no one can say </s>
<s>  it may be years hence </s>
<s>  now you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however
distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the
communications you may have with me </s>
<s>  if you have a suspicion in your own
breast keep that suspicion in your own breast </s>
<s>  it is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are </s>
<s>  they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim </s>
<s>  this is not for
you to inquire into </s>
<s>  the condition is laid down </s>
<s>  your acceptance of it
and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition
that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions
and for whom i am not otherwise responsible </s>
<s>  that person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me </s>
<s>  again not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune </s>
<s>  but if you have any objection to it
this is the time to mention it </s>
<s>  speak out </s>
<s> 

once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection </s>
<s> 

i should think not </s>
<s>  now <abvr> pip i have done with stipulations </s>
<s> 
 though he called me <abvr> pip and began rather to make up to me he still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion </s>
<s>  and even now
he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement if he only chose to mention them </s>
<s>  we come next to mere
details of arrangement </s>
<s>  you must know that although i have used
the term ˜expectations more than once you are not endowed with
expectations only </s>
<s>  there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance </s>
<s>  you will
please consider me your guardian </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  for i was going to thank him i
tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldnt render them </s>
<s> 
it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with
your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage </s>
<s> 

i said i had always longed for it </s>
<s> 

never mind what you have always longed for <abvr> pip he retorted </s>
<s> 
keep to the record </s>
<s>  if you long for it now thats enough </s>
<s>  am i
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor </s>
<s>  is that it </s>
<s> 

i stammered yes that was it </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  now your inclinations are to be consulted </s>
<s>  i dont think that
wise mind but its my trust </s>
<s>  have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another </s>
<s> 

i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and <abvr> wopsles greataunt </s>
<s> 
so i replied in the negative </s>
<s> 

there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think
might suit the purpose said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  i dont recommend him
observe </s>
<s>  because i never recommend anybody </s>
<s>  the gentleman i speak of is
one <abvr> matthew pocket </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  i caught at the name directly </s>
<s>  miss havishams relation </s>
<s>  the matthew
whom <abvr> and <abvr> camilla had spoken of </s>
<s>  the matthew whose place was to
be at miss havishams head when she lay dead in her brides dress on
the brides table </s>
<s> 

you know the name </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then
shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer </s>
<s> 

my answer was that i had heard of the name </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  you have heard of the name </s>
<s>  but the question is what do
you say of it </s>
<s> 

i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his
recommendation

no my young friend </s>
<s>  he interrupted shaking his great head very
slowly </s>
<s>  recollect yourself </s>
<s> 

not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him
for his recommendation

no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and
smiling both at onceno no no </s>
<s>  its very well done but it wont
do </s>
<s>  you are too young to fix me with it </s>
<s>  recommendation is not the word
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s>  try another </s>
<s> 

correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention
of <abvr> matthew pocket

thats more like it </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> and i added i would
gladly try that gentleman </s>
<s> 

good </s>
<s>  you had better try him in his own house </s>
<s>  the way shall be
prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london </s>
<s>  when
will you come to london </s>
<s> 

i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i
supposed i could come directly </s>
<s> 

first said <abvr> jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in
and they should not be workingclothes </s>
<s>  say this day week </s>
<s>  youll want
some money </s>
<s>  shall i leave you twenty guineas </s>
<s> 

he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me </s>
<s>  this was the first time he
had taken his leg from the chair </s>
<s>  he sat astride of the chair when he
had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe </s>
<s> 

well joseph gargery </s>
<s>  you look dumbfoundered </s>
<s> 

i am </s>
<s>  said joe in a very decided manner </s>
<s> 

it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember </s>
<s> 

it were understood said joe </s>
<s>  and it are understood </s>
<s>  and it ever will
be similar according </s>
<s> 

but what said <abvr> jaggers swinging his pursewhat if it was in my
instructions to make you a present as compensation </s>
<s> 

as compensation what for </s>
<s>  joe demanded </s>
<s> 

for the loss of his services </s>
<s> 

joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman </s>
<s>  i have
often thought him since like the steamhammer that can crush a man or
pat an eggshell in his combination of strength with gentleness </s>
<s>  pip
is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to
honor and fortun as no words can tell him </s>
<s>  but if you think as money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come
to the forgeand ever the best of friends </s>
<s> 

o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i
see you again with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes
and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away </s>
<s>  o dear good
faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing </s>
<s> 

but i encouraged joe at the time </s>
<s>  i was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together </s>
<s>  i
begged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best
of friends and as i said we ever would be so </s>
<s>  joe scooped his eyes
with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but
said not another word </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognized in joe the
village idiot and in me his keeper </s>
<s>  when it was over he said weighing
in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing </s>
<s> 

now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance </s>
<s>  no half
measures with me </s>
<s>  if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge
to make you speak out and you shall have it </s>
<s>  if on the contrary you
mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joes
suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose </s>
<s> 

which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place
bullbaiting and badgering me come out </s>
<s>  which i meantersay as sech if
youre a man come on </s>
<s>  which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay
and stand or fall by </s>
<s> 

i drew joe away and he immediately became placable </s>
<s>  merely stating to
me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern that he were not a going to be
bullbaited and badgered in his own place </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers had risen when
joe demonstrated and had backed near the door </s>
<s>  without evincing
any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory
remarks </s>
<s>  they were these </s>
<s> 

well <abvr> pip i think the sooner you leave hereas you are to be a
gentlemanthe better </s>
<s>  let it stand for this day week and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime </s>
<s>  you can take a hackneycoach
at the stagecoach office in london and come straight to me </s>
<s> 
understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust
i undertake </s>
<s>  i am paid for undertaking it and i do so </s>
<s>  now understand
that finally </s>
<s>  understand that </s>
<s> 

he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone
on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off </s>
<s> 

something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was
going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage </s>
<s> 

i beg your pardon <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he facing round whats the matter </s>
<s> 

i wish to be quite right <abvr> jaggers and to keep to your directions </s>
<s> 
so i thought i had better ask </s>
<s>  would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one i know about here before i go away </s>
<s> 

no said he looking as if he hardly understood me </s>
<s> 

i dont mean in the village only but up town </s>
<s> 

no said he </s>
<s>  no objection </s>
<s> 

i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the
burning coals </s>
<s>  i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals
and nothing was said for a long time </s>
<s> 

my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her
needlework before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe
in the corner opposite my sister </s>
<s>  the more i looked into the glowing
coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe </s>
<s>  the longer the
silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak </s>
<s> 

at length i got out joe have you told biddy </s>
<s> 

no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his
knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip </s>
<s> 

i would rather you told joe </s>
<s> 

pips a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in
it </s>
<s> 

biddy dropped her work and looked at me </s>
<s>  joe held his knees and looked
at me </s>
<s>  i looked at both of them </s>
<s>  after a pause they both heartily
congratulated me </s>
<s>  but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that i rather resented </s>
<s> 

i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with the
grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and say
nothing about the maker of my fortune </s>
<s>  it would all come out in good
time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save
that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron </s>
<s>  biddy
nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again
and said she would be very particular </s>
<s>  and joe still detaining his
knees said ay ay ill be ekervally partickler pip </s>
<s>  and then they
congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that i didnt half like it </s>
<s> 

infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened </s>
<s>  to the best of my belief those efforts entirely
failed </s>
<s>  she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even
repeated after biddy the words pip and property </s>
<s>  but i doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest
a darker picture of her state of mind </s>
<s> 

i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and
biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy </s>
<s> 
dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be </s>
<s>  but it is
possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied
with myself </s>
<s> 

any how i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand
looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and
about what they should do without me and all that </s>
<s>  and whenever i
caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they
often looked at meparticularly biddy i felt offended </s>
<s>  as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me </s>
<s>  though heaven knows they never did
by word or sign </s>
<s> 

at those times i would get up and look out at the door </s>
<s>  for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room </s>
<s>  the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid
i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which i had passed my life </s>
<s> 

saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
and beer </s>
<s>  five more days and then the day before the day </s>
<s>  theyll soon
go </s>
<s> 

yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug </s>
<s> 
theyll soon go </s>
<s> 

soon soon go said biddy </s>
<s> 

i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and
order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that ill come and put
them on there or that ill have them sent to <abvr> pumblechooks </s>
<s>  it
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure
too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on
it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices </s>
<s>  so might
wopsle </s>
<s>  and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment </s>
<s> 

thats just what i dont want joe </s>
<s>  they would make such a business of
itsuch a coarse and common businessthat i couldnt bear myself </s>
<s> 

ah that indeed pip </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  if you couldnt abear yourself

biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sisters plate have you
thought about when youll show yourself to <abvr> gargery and your sister
and me </s>
<s>  you will show yourself to us </s>
<s>  wont you </s>
<s> 

biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick
that its difficult to keep up with you </s>
<s> 

she always were quick observed joe </s>
<s> 

if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say
that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one eveningmost likely
on the evening before i go away </s>
<s> 

biddy said no more </s>
<s>  handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed </s>
<s>  when i got
into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean
little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for
ever </s>
<s>  it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at
the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in
so often between the forge and miss havishams and biddy and estella </s>
<s> 

the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and
the room was warm </s>
<s>  as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw
joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two
in the air </s>
<s>  and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light
it for him </s>
<s>  he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he
wanted comforting for some reason or other </s>
<s> 

he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe
and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they
talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once </s>
<s>  i would not have listened for more if i could
have heard more </s>
<s>  so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever
known </s>
<s> 

looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joes pipe
floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joenot
obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared
together </s>
<s>  i put my light out and crept into bed </s>
<s>  and it was an uneasy
bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more </s>
<s> 




chapter xix

morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same </s>
<s>  what lay
heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure </s>
<s>  for i could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and
that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone </s>
<s> 

joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our
approaching separation </s>
<s>  but they only referred to it when i did </s>
<s>  after
breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free </s>
<s>  with
all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all </s>
<s> 

after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off
the marshes at once and get them done with </s>
<s>  as i passed the church i
felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after
sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds </s>
<s>  i promised myself that i would do something for them
one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding a pint of ale and a gallon of
condescension upon everybody in the village </s>

if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my
companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those
graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled
the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge </s>
<s>  my
comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless
been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might
be veritably dead into the bargain </s>
<s> 

no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these
grazing cattlethough they seemed in their dull manner to wear a
more respectful air now and to face round in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectationsfarewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood
henceforth i was for london and greatness </s>
<s>  not for smiths work in
general and for you </s>
<s>  i made my exultant way to the old battery and
lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended
me for estella fell asleep </s>
<s> 

when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me
smoking his pipe </s>
<s>  he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes and said

as being the last time pip i thought id foller </s>
<s> 

and joe i am very glad you did so </s>
<s> 

thankee pip </s>
<s> 

you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that
i shall never forget you </s>
<s> 

no no pip </s>
<s>  said joe in a comfortable tone im sure of that </s>
<s>  ay
ay old chap </s>
<s>  bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in
a mans mind to be certain on it </s>
<s>  but it took a bit of time to get it
well round the change come so oncommon plump </s>
<s>  didnt it </s>
<s> 

somehow i was not best pleased with joes being so mightily secure of
me </s>
<s>  i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said
it does you credit pip or something of that sort </s>
<s>  therefore i made
no remark on joes first head </s>
<s>  merely saying as to his second that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a
gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i
were one </s>
<s> 

have you though </s>
<s>  said joe </s>
<s>  astonishing </s>
<s> 

its a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more
when we had our lessons here </s>
<s>  isnt it </s>
<s> 

well i dont know returned joe </s>
<s>  im so awful dull </s>
<s>  im only master
of my own trade </s>
<s>  it were always a pity as i was so awful dull </s>
<s>  but its
no more of a pity now than it wasthis day twelvemonthdont you
see </s>
<s> 

what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to
do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he
had been better qualified for a rise in station </s>
<s>  he was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to
biddy in preference </s>
<s> 

so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget
her said i had a favor to ask of her </s>
<s> 

and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of
helping joe on a little </s>
<s> 

how helping him on </s>
<s>  asked biddy with a steady sort of glance </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  joe is a dear good fellowin fact i think he is the dearest
fellow that ever livedbut he is rather backward in some things </s>
<s>  for
instance biddy in his learning and his manners </s>
<s> 

although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her
eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me </s>
<s> 

o his manners </s>
<s>  wont his manners do then </s>
<s>  asked biddy plucking a
blackcurrant leaf </s>
<s> 

my dear biddy they do very well here

o </s>
<s>  they do very well here </s>
<s>  interrupted biddy looking closely at the
leaf in her hand </s>
<s> 

hear me outbut if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i
shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would
hardly do him justice </s>
<s> 

and dont you think he knows that </s>
<s>  asked biddy </s>
<s> 

it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me that i said snappishly

biddy what do you mean </s>
<s> 

biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her handsand the
smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lanesaid have you never
considered that he may be proud </s>
<s> 

proud </s>
<s>  i repeated with disdainful emphasis </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and
shaking her head </s>
<s>  pride is not all of one kind

well </s>
<s>  what are you stopping for </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not all of one kind resumed biddy </s>
<s>  he may be too proud to let any
one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well
and with respect </s>
<s>  to tell you the truth i think he is </s>
<s>  though it sounds
bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do </s>
<s> 

now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you </s>
<s>  i did not
expect to see this in you </s>
<s>  you are envious biddy and grudging </s>
<s>  you
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you cant help
showing it </s>
<s> 

if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so </s>
<s>  say so
over and over again if you have the heart to think so </s>
<s> 

if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous
and superior tone </s>
<s>  dont put it off upon me </s>
<s>  i am very sorry to see it
and its aits a bad side of human nature </s>
<s>  i did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of
improving dear joe </s>
<s>  but after this i ask you nothing </s>
<s>  i am extremely
sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated </s>
<s>  its aits a bad side
of human nature </s>
<s> 

whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here
at all times </s>
<s>  and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you </s>
<s>  yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither said biddy turning away her head </s>
<s> 

i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which
sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i
was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and
biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until suppertime </s>
<s>  again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first </s>
<s> 

but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to
biddy and we dropped the subject </s>
<s>  putting on the best clothes i had
i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open
and presented myself before <abvr> trabb the tailor who was having his
breakfast in the parlor behind his shop and who did not think it worth
his while to come out to me but called me into him </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said <abvr> trabb in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way </s>
<s>  how are
you and what can i do for you </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds and was
slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up </s>
<s>  he was a
prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of
his prosperity were put away in it in bags </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb said i its an unpleasant thing to have to mention
because it looks like boasting </s>
<s>  but i have come into a handsome
property </s>
<s> 

a change passed over <abvr> trabb </s>
<s>  he forgot the butter in bed got up from
the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord
bless my soul </s>
<s> 

i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them </s>
<s>  and i want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in </s>
<s>  i wish to pay for them i addedotherwise i
thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money </s>
<s> 

my dear sir said <abvr> trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened
his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow dont hurt me by mentioning that </s>
<s>  may i venture to congratulate
you </s>
<s>  would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabbs boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside </s>
<s> 
when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his
labors by sweeping over me </s>
<s>  he was still sweeping when i came out into
the shop with <abvr> trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any
blacksmith alive or dead </s>
<s> 

hold that noise said <abvr> trabb with the greatest sternness or ill
knock your head off </s>
<s> do me the favor to be seated sir </s>
<s>  now this
 said <abvr> trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under
it to show the gloss is a very sweet article </s>
<s>  i can recommend it for
your purpose sir because it really is extra super </s>
<s>  but you shall
see some others </s>
<s>  give me number four you </s>
<s>  to the boy and with a
dreadfully severe stare </s>
<s>  foreseeing the danger of that miscreants
brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again </s>
<s> 
then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight </s>
<s>  and let
me have none of your tricks here said <abvr> trabb or you shall repent
it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that
it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
fellowtownsmans if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having
worn </s>
<s>  are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said <abvr>
trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself </s>
<s> 

i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of <abvr> trabbs
judgment and reentered the parlor to be measured </s>
<s>  for although <abvr>
trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented
with it he said apologetically that it wouldnt do under existing
circumstances sirwouldnt do at all </s>
<s>  so <abvr> trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor as if i were an estate and he the finest
species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that
i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
pains </s>
<s>  when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to <abvr> pumblechooks on the thursday evening he said with his hand
upon the parlor lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work as a rule </s>
<s>  but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem
it </s>
<s>  good morning sir much obliged </s>
<s> door </s>
<s> 

the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what
it meant </s>
<s>  but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was that it had morally laid upon his back trabbs boy </s>
<s> 

after this memorable event i went to the hatters and the bootmakers
and the hosiers and felt rather like mother hubbards dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades </s>
<s>  i also went to the coachoffice
and took my place for seven oclock on saturday morning </s>
<s>  it was
not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome
property </s>
<s>  but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through
the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me </s>
<s>  when
i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards
pumblechooks and as i approached that gentlemans place of business
i saw him standing at his door </s>
<s> 

he was waiting for me with great impatience </s>
<s>  he had been out early with
the chaisecart and had called at the forge and heard the news </s>
<s>  he had
prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlor and he too ordered
his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed </s>
<s> 

my dear friend said <abvr> pumblechook taking me by both hands when
he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good
fortune </s>
<s>  well deserved well deserved </s>
<s> 

this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself </s>
<s> 

to think said <abvr> pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for
some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this is a proud reward </s>
<s> 

i begged <abvr> pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted on that point </s>
<s> 

my dear young friend said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s>  if you will allow me to
call you so

i murmured certainly and <abvr> pumblechook took me by both hands again
and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional
appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely
upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before
the mind of joseph </s>
<s> joseph </s>
<s>  said <abvr> pumblechook in the way of a
compassionate adjuration </s>
<s>  joseph </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  joseph </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  thereupon he shook his
head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph </s>
<s> 

but my dear young friend said <abvr> pumblechook you must be hungry
you must be exhausted </s>
<s>  be seated </s>
<s>  here is a chicken had round from the
boar here is a tongue had round from the boar heres one or two little
things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise </s>
<s>  but do

down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy
infancy </s>
<s>  and may imay i </s>
<s> 

this may i meant might he shake hands </s>
<s>  i consented and he was fervent
and then sat down again </s>
<s> 

here is wine said <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s>  let us drink thanks to fortune
and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment </s>
<s>  and yet i
cannot said <abvr> pumblechook getting up again see afore me oneand
likewise drink to onewithout again expressingmay imay i </s>
<s> 

i said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass
and turned it upside down </s>
<s>  i did the same </s>
<s>  and if i had turned myself
upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to
my head </s>
<s> 

mr </s>

tongue none of those outoftheway no thoroughfares of pork now and
took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all </s>

<s>  you little thought said <abvr> pumblechook apostrophizing the
fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for
you </s>

roof for one ascall it a weakness if you will said <abvr> pumblechook
getting up again but may i </s>
<s>  may i </s>
<s> 

it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so
he did it at once </s>
<s>  how he ever did it so often without wounding himself
with my knife i dont know </s>
<s> 

and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had
the honor of bringing you up by hand </s>
<s>  its a sad picter to reflect that
shes no longer equal to fully understanding the honor </s>
<s>  may

i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him </s>
<s> 

well drink her health said i </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  cried <abvr> pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid
with admiration thats the way you know ˜em sir </s>
<s>  i dont know
who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person
present </s>
<s>  thats the way you know the nobleminded sir </s>
<s>  ever forgiving
and ever affable </s>
<s>  it might said the servile pumblechook putting down
his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person
have the appearance of repeatingbut may i </s>
<s> 

when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister </s>
<s>  let us
never be blind said <abvr> pumblechook to her faults of temper but it
is to be hoped she meant well </s>
<s> 

at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in
the face </s>
<s>  as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting </s>
<s> 

i mentioned to <abvr> pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes
sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him </s>
<s>  i
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village
and he lauded it to the skies </s>
<s>  there was nobody but himself he
intimated worthy of my confidence andin short might he </s>
<s>  then he
asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend </s>
<s>  if i had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he
never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea </s>
<s>  yet for all that i remember feeling
convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a
sensible practical goodhearted prime fellow </s>
<s> 

by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my
advice in reference to his own affairs </s>
<s>  he mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood </s>
<s>  what alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital </s>
<s> 
those were the two little words more capital </s>
<s>  now it appeared to him
pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a
sleeping partner sirwhich sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine
the booksand walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
pocket to the tune of fifty per centit appeared to him that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property which would be worthy of his attention </s>
<s>  but what did i think </s>
<s> 
he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think </s>
<s>  i gave it
as my opinion </s>
<s>  wait a bit </s>
<s>  the united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands
with me but said he really mustand did </s>
<s> 

we drank all the wine and <abvr> pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep joseph up to the mark i dont know what mark and to
render me efficient and constant service i dont know what service </s>
<s>  he
also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after
having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me
that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common
fortun </s>
<s>  he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now and i said so too </s>
<s>  finally i went out into the air with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road </s>
<s> 

there i was roused by <abvr> pumblechooks hailing me </s>
<s>  he was a long way
down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop </s>
<s>  i stopped and he came up breathless </s>
<s> 

no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech </s>
<s> 
not if i can help it </s>
<s>  this occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part </s>
<s> may i as an old friend and wellwisher </s>
<s> 
may i </s>
<s> 

we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation </s>
<s>  then he blessed
me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the
road </s>
<s>  and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before i pursued my way home </s>
<s> 

i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little
i possessed was adapted to my new station </s>
<s>  but i began packing that same
afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next
morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost </s>
<s> 

so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed </s>
<s>  and on friday morning i
went to <abvr> pumblechooks to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
miss havisham </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechooks own room was given up to me to dress
in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event </s>
<s>  my
clothes were rather a disappointment of course </s>
<s>  probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell
a trifle short of the wearers expectation </s>
<s>  but after i had had my
new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with <abvr> pumblechooks very limited dressingglass in the
futile endeavor to see my legs it seemed to fit me better </s>
<s>  it being
market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off <abvr> pumblechook
was not at home </s>
<s>  i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and
was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing </s>
<s>  this was
all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a
personal disadvantage something like joes in his sunday suit </s>
<s> 

i went circuitously to miss havishams by all the back ways and rang
at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves </s>
<s>  sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when
she saw me so changed </s>
<s>  her walnutshell countenance likewise turned from
brown to green and yellow </s>
<s> 

you </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s>  you </s>
<s>  good gracious </s>
<s>  what do you want </s>
<s> 

i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say goodbye to
miss havisham </s>
<s> 

i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went
to ask if i were to be admitted </s>
<s>  after a very short delay she returned
and took me up staring at me all the way </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table leaning on her crutch stick </s>
<s>  the room was lighted as of yore and
at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned </s>
<s>  she was then just
abreast of the rotted bridecake </s>
<s> 

dont go sarah she said </s>
<s>  well pip </s>
<s> 

i start for london miss havisham tomorrow i was exceedingly
careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you </s>

round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were
bestowing the finishing gift </s>

<s>

<s> 

she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to
my lips </s>
<s>  i had not considered how i should take leave of her </s>
<s>  it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this </s>
<s>  she looked at sarah pocket
with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with
both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs </s>
<s> 

sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen
out </s>
<s>  she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree
confounded </s>
<s>  i said goodbye miss pocket </s>
<s>  but she merely stared and
did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken </s>
<s>  clear of the
house i made the best of my way back to pumblechooks took off my new
clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress
carrying itto speak the truthmuch more at my ease too though i had
the bundle to carry </s>
<s> 

and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had
run out fast and were gone and tomorrow looked me in the face more
steadily than i could look at it </s>
<s>  as the six evenings had dwindled
away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more
appreciative of the society of joe and biddy </s>
<s>  on this last evening i
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my
splendor until bedtime </s>
<s>  we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by
the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with </s>
<s>  we were
all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits </s>
<s> 

i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little
handportmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all
alone </s>
<s>  i am afraidsore afraidthat this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to
the coach together </s>
<s>  i had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement </s>
<s>  but when i went up to my little room
on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me
in the morning </s>
<s>  i did not </s>
<s> 

all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places
instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now
pigs now mennever horses </s>
<s>  fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing </s>
<s>  then i got up and
partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in
taking it fell asleep </s>
<s> 

biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not
sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon </s>
<s> 
but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs </s>
<s> 
after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy
called to me that i was late </s>
<s> 

it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it </s>
<s>  i got up from the meal
saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me
well </s>
<s>  i suppose i must be off </s>
<s>  and then i kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed
biddy and threw my arms around joes neck </s>
<s>  then i took up my little
portmanteau and walked out </s>
<s>  the last i saw of them was when i presently
heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old
shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe </s>
<s>  i stopped then to
wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head
crying huskily hooroar </s>
<s>  and biddy put her apron to her face </s>
<s> 

i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had
supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high
street </s>
<s>  i whistled and made nothing of going </s>
<s>  but the village was very
peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to
show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all
beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob i broke into tears </s>
<s>  it was by the fingerpost at the end of the
village and i laid my hand upon it and said goodbye o my dear dear
friend </s>
<s> 

heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts </s>
<s>  i was
better after i had cried than beforemore sorry more aware of my own
ingratitude more gentle </s>
<s>  if i had cried before i should have had joe
with me then </s>
<s> 

so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear
of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at
home and a better parting </s>
<s>  we changed and i had not made up my mind
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back when we changed again </s>
<s>  and while i was occupied
with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe
in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat
high </s>
<s> as if he could possibly be there </s>
<s> 

we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to
go back and i went on </s>
<s>  and the mists had all solemnly risen now and
the world lay spread before me </s>
<s> 

this is the end of the first stage of pips expectations </s>

chapter xx

the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours </s>
<s>  it was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by
which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the cross keys wood street cheapside london </s>
<s> 

we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything </s>
<s>  otherwise
while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and
dirty </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had duly sent me his address </s>
<s>  it was little britain and he
had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by
the coachoffice </s>
<s>  nevertheless a hackneycoachman who seemed to have
as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old packed me
up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles </s>
<s>  his getting on his
box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weatherstained
peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags was quite a work of time </s>
<s> 
it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged
things behind for i dont know how many footmen to hold on by and
a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation </s>
<s> 

i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
strawyard it was and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why
the horses nosebags were kept inside when i observed the coachman
beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently </s>
<s>  and stop
we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open
door whereon was painted <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

how much </s>
<s>  i asked the coachman </s>
<s> 

the coachman answered a shillingunless you wish to make it more </s>
<s> 

i naturally said i had no wish to make it more </s>
<s> 

then it must be a shilling observed the coachman </s>
<s>  i dont want to
get into trouble </s>
<s>  i know him </s>
<s>  he darkly closed an eye at <abvr> jaggerss
name and shook his head </s>
<s> 

when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his
mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked was <abvr> jaggers at home </s>
<s> 

he is not returned the clerk </s>
<s>  he is in court at present </s>
<s>  am i
addressing <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

i signified that he was addressing <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers left word would you wait in his room </s>
<s>  he couldnt say how
long he might be having a case on </s>
<s>  but it stands to reason his time
being valuable that he wont be longer than he can help </s>
<s> 

with those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back </s>
<s>  here we found a gentleman with one eye in a
velveteen suit and kneebreeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper </s>
<s> 

go and wait outside mike said the clerk </s>
<s> 

i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used
and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal
place </s>
<s>  the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it </s>
<s>  there were not so many papers about as i
should have expected to see </s>
<s>  and there were some odd objects about that
i should not have expected to seesuch as an old rusty pistol a
sword in a scabbard several strangelooking boxes and packages and
two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy
about the nose </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggerss own highbacked chair was of deadly black
horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin </s>
<s>  and i
fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at
the clients </s>
<s>  the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall </s>
<s>  the wall especially opposite to
mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss chair being greasy with shoulders </s>
<s>  i recalled too that
the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was
the innocent cause of his being turned out </s>
<s> 

i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against <abvr> jaggerss
chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place </s>
<s>  i
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody elses disadvantage as his master had </s>
<s>  i wondered how many
other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures </s>
<s>  i wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came
there </s>
<s>  i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of <abvr> jaggerss
family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
illlooking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home </s>
<s> 
of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything </s>
<s>  but i sat wondering and waiting in <abvr>
jaggerss close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above <abvr> jaggerss chair and got up and went out </s>
<s> 

when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i
waited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into
smithfield </s>
<s>  so i came into smithfield </s>
<s>  and the shameful place being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me </s>
<s>  so
i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
i saw the great black dome of saint pauls bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison </s>
<s>  following
the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles </s>
<s>  and from this and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred
that the trials were on </s>
<s> 

while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a
trial or so </s>
<s>  informing me that he could give me a front place for half a
crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in
his wig and robesmentioning that awful personage like waxwork and
presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence </s>
<s>  as i
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also
where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors
door out of which culprits came to be hanged </s>
<s>  heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on ˜em
 would come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the
morning to be killed in a row </s>
<s>  this was horrible and gave me a
sickening idea of london </s>
<s>  the more so as the lord chief justices
proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
pockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had
bought cheap of the executioner </s>
<s>  under these circumstances i thought
myself well rid of him for a shilling </s>
<s> 

i dropped into the office to ask if <abvr> jaggers had come in yet and i
found he had not and i strolled out again </s>
<s>  this time i made the tour
of little britain and turned into bartholomew close </s>
<s>  and now i became
aware that other people were waiting about for <abvr> jaggers as well
as i </s>
<s>  there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew
close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me that jaggers would do it if it was to be done </s>
<s> 
 there was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and
one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted
her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders jaggers
is for him ˜melia and what more could you have </s>
<s>  there was a redeyed
little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in
company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand </s>
<s>  and
while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly
excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamppost and
accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words o jaggerth
jaggerth jaggerth </s>
<s>  all otherth ith cagmaggerth give me jaggerth </s>
<s> 
 these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever </s>
<s> 

at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close
into little britain i saw <abvr> jaggers coming across the road towards
me </s>
<s>  all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there
was quite a rush at him </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed
himself to his followers </s>
<s> 

first he took the two secret men </s>
<s> 

now i have nothing to say to you said <abvr> jaggers throwing his
finger at them </s>
<s>  i want to know no more than i know </s>
<s>  as to the result
its a tossup </s>
<s>  i told you from the first it was a tossup </s>
<s>  have you
paid wemmick </s>
<s> 

we made the money up this morning sir said one of the men
submissively while the other perused <abvr> jaggerss face </s>
<s> 

i dont ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it
up at all </s>
<s>  has wemmick got it </s>
<s> 

yes sir said both the men together </s>
<s>

<s>  said mr jaggers
waving his hand at them to put them behind him </s>
<s>  if you say a word to

<s>  i dont want you to find me </s>

the two men looked at one another as <abvr> jaggers waved them behind
again and humbly fell back and were heard no more </s>
<s> 

and now you </s>

the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly
separatedoh </s>

yes <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

and do you remember retorted <abvr> jaggers that but for me you
wouldnt be here and couldnt be here </s>

<s> 

then why said <abvr> jaggers do you come here </s>

this terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately </s>
<s> 
no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the
skirts of <abvr> jaggerss coat to his lips several times </s>

my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and
left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot </s>
<s>  without further
interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap </s>
<s> 

heres mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and
approaching <abvr> jaggers confidentially </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of
hair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling

well masr jaggers returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a

well masr jaggers said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this

<s>  now i warned you before said
he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever
presumed to talk in that way here id make an example of you </s>
<s>  you
infernal scoundrel how dare you tell me that </s>

the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious
what he had done </s>
<s> 

spooney </s>
<s>  said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his
elbow </s>
<s>  soft head </s>
<s>  need you say it face to face </s>
<s> 

now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly
once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is
prepared to swear </s>
<s> 

mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson
from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having
been in his company and never left him all the night in question </s>
<s> 

now be careful </s>
<s>  in what station of life is this man </s>
<s> 

mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the
ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner weve dressed him up like
 when my guardian blustered out

what </s>
<s>  you will will you </s>
<s> 

spooney </s>
<s>  added the clerk again with another stir </s>
<s> 

after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again </s>
<s> 

he is dressed like a ˜spectable pieman </s>
<s>  a sort of a pastrycook </s>
<s> 

is he here </s>
<s>  asked my guardian </s>
<s> 

i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner </s>
<s> 

take him past that window and let me see him </s>
<s> 

the window indicated was the office window </s>
<s>  we all three went to
it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner with a murderouslooking tall individual in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap </s>
<s>  this guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery
which was painted over </s>
<s> 

tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the
clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a
fellow as that </s>
<s> 

my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched
standing from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to
bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he
had made for me </s>
<s>  i was to go to barnards inn to young <abvr> pockets
rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation </s>
<s>  i was to
remain with young <abvr> pocket until monday </s>
<s>  on monday i was to go with
him to his fathers house on a visit that i might try how i liked it </s>
<s> 
also i was told what my allowance was to beit was a very liberal
oneand had handed to me from one of my guardians drawers the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes
and such other things as i could in reason want </s>
<s>  you will find your
credit good <abvr> pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by
this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you
outrunning the constable </s>
<s>  of course youll go wrong somehow but thats
no fault of mine </s>
<s> 

after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers if i could send for a coach </s>
<s>  he said it was not worth while
i was so near my destination </s>
<s>  wemmick should walk round with me if i
pleased </s>
<s> 

i then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room </s>
<s>  another clerk
was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i
accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian </s>
<s> 
we found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you its no use </s>
<s>  he
wont have a word to say to one of you </s>
<s>  and we soon got clear of them
and went on side by side </s>

chapter xxi

casting my eyes on <abvr> wemmick as we went along to see what he was
like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in
stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel </s>
<s>  there were some marks
in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints </s>
<s>  the chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off </s>
<s>  i judged him
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements </s>
<s>  for he wore at least four
mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it </s>
<s>  i noticed too that several rings
and seals hung at his watchchain as if he were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends </s>
<s>  he had glittering eyessmall keen
and blackand thin wide mottled lips </s>
<s>  he had had them to the best of
my belief from forty to fifty years </s>
<s> 

so you were never in london before </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmick to me </s>
<s> 

no said i </s>
<s> 

i was new here once said <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  rum to think of now </s>
<s> 

you are well acquainted with it now </s>
<s> 

why yes said <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  i know the moves of it </s>
<s> 

is it a very wicked place </s>
<s>  i asked more for the sake of saying
something than for information </s>
<s> 

you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london </s>
<s>  but there are
plenty of people anywhere wholl do that for you </s>
<s> 

if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a
little </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  i dont know about bad blood returned <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  theres not
much bad blood about </s>
<s>  theyll do it if theres anything to be got by
it </s>
<s> 

that makes it worse </s>
<s> 

you think so </s>
<s>  returned <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  much about the same i should
say </s>
<s> 

he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him </s>
<s> 
walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his attention </s>
<s>  his mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth
that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling </s>
<s>  we had got to the top of
holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance
and that he was not smiling at all </s>
<s> 

do you know where <abvr> matthew pocket lives </s>
<s>  i asked <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

yes said he nodding in the direction </s>
<s>  at hammersmith west of
london </s>
<s> 

is that far </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  say five miles </s>
<s> 

do you know him </s>
<s> 

why youre a regular crossexaminer </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmick looking at me
with an approving air </s>
<s>  yes i know him </s>
<s>  i know him </s>
<s> 

there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
these words that rather depressed me </s>
<s>  and i was still looking sideways
at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text
when he said here we were at barnards inn </s>
<s>  my depression was not
alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by <abvr> barnard to which the blue boar in our town
was a mere publichouse </s>
<s>  whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied
spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
tomcats </s>
<s> 

we entered this haven through a wicketgate and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat buryingground </s>
<s>  i thought it had the most dismal trees in
it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most
dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen </s>
<s>  i
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled
flowerpot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift </s>
<s>  while
to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new
wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel </s>
<s>  a frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn
ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dusthole </s>
<s>  thus far my sense of sight </s>
<s>  while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellarrot of rat
and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand besidesaddressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnards
mixture </s>
<s> 

so imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations
that i looked in dismay at <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  said he mistaking me </s>
<s> 
the retirement reminds you of the country </s>
<s>  so it does me </s>
<s> 

he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairswhich
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming downto a set of chambers on
the top floor </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket jun </s>
<s>  was painted on the door and there was
a label on the letterbox return shortly </s>
<s> 

he hardly thought youd come so soon <abvr> wemmick explained </s>
<s>  you
dont want me any more </s>
<s> 

no thank you said i </s>
<s> 

as i keep the cash <abvr> wemmick observed we shall most likely meet
pretty often </s>
<s>  good day </s>
<s> 

good day </s>
<s> 

i put out my hand and <abvr> wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought i wanted something </s>
<s>  then he looked at me and said correcting
himself

to be sure </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  youre in the habit of shaking hands </s>
<s> 

i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion
but said yes </s>
<s> 

i have got so out of it </s>
<s>  said <abvr> wemmickexcept at last </s>
<s>  very
glad im sure to make your acquaintance </s>
<s>  good day </s>
<s> 

when we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it
came down like the guillotine </s>
<s>  happily it was so quick that i had not
put my head out </s>
<s>  after this escape i was content to take a foggy view
of the inn through the windows encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully
looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket juniors idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window before i heard footsteps on the stairs </s>
<s>  gradually there arose
before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a
member of society of about my own standing </s>

each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of
breath </s>

<s>  the fact is i have been out on your accountnot
that that is any excusefor i thought coming from the country you

as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paperbags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold
them </s>
<s>  he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast </s>
<s>  it yielded so suddenly at last
that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite
door and we both laughed </s>
<s>  but still i felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head and as if this must be a dream </s>
<s> 

pray come in said <abvr> pocket junior </s>
<s>  allow me to lead the way </s>
<s>  i am
rather bare here but i hope youll be able to make out tolerably well

<s>  my father thought you would get on more agreeably through

london </s>

<s>  as to our

coffeehouse here and it is only right i should add at your expense
such being <abvr> jaggerss directions </s>
<s>  as to our lodging its not by

<s>  this is our sittingroomjust such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth you see as they could spare from home </s>
<s>  you mustnt give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come
for you from the coffeehouse </s>

as i stood opposite to <abvr> pocket junior delivering him the bags one

chapter xxii

the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in
barnards inn until we both burst out laughing </s>
<s>  the idea of its
being you </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  the idea of its being you </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  and then we
contemplated one another afresh and laughed again </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  said the
pale young gentleman reaching out his hand goodhumoredly its all
over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me
for having knocked you about so </s>
<s> 

i derived from this speech that <abvr> herbert pocket for herbert was the
pale young gentlemans name still rather confounded his intention with
his execution </s>
<s>  but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly </s>
<s> 

you hadnt come into your good fortune at that time </s>
<s>  said herbert
pocket </s>
<s> 

no said i </s>
<s> 

no he acquiesced </s>
<s>  i heard it had happened very lately </s>
<s>  i was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then </s>
<s> 

indeed </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to
me </s>
<s>  but she couldntat all events she didnt </s>
<s> 

i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that </s>
<s> 

bad taste said herbert laughing but a fact </s>
<s>  yes she had sent for
me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i
suppose i should have been provided for </s>
<s>  perhaps i should have been
whatyoumaycalled it to estella </s>
<s> 

whats that </s>
<s>  i asked with sudden gravity </s>
<s> 

he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his
attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word </s>
<s> 
affianced he explained still busy with the fruit </s>
<s>  betrothed </s>
<s> 
engaged </s>
<s>  whatshisnamed </s>
<s>  any word of that sort </s>
<s> 

how did you bear your disappointment </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said he i didnt care much for it </s>
<s>  shes a tartar </s>
<s> 

miss havisham </s>
<s> 

i dont say no to that but i meant estella </s>
<s>  that girls hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by
miss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex </s>
<s> 

what relation is she to miss havisham </s>
<s> 

none said he </s>
<s>  only adopted </s>
<s> 

why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex </s>
<s>  what revenge </s>
<s> 

lord <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  dont you know </s>
<s> 

no said i </s>
<s> 

dear me </s>
<s>  its quite a story and shall be saved till dinnertime </s>
<s>  and
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question </s>
<s>  how did you come
there that day </s>
<s> 

i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst
out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards </s>
<s>  i didnt
ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers is your guardian i understand </s>
<s>  he went on </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

you know he is miss havishams man of business and solicitor and has
her confidence when nobody else has </s>
<s> 

this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground </s>
<s>  i answered with
a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen <abvr> jaggers
in miss havishams house on the very day of our combat but never at any
other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there </s>
<s> 

he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he
called on my father to propose it </s>
<s>  of course he knew about my father
from his connection with miss havisham </s>
<s>  my father is miss havishams
cousin </s>
<s>  not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her </s>
<s> 

herbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking </s>
<s> 
i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since
who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean </s>
<s>  there was something
wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the
same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich </s>
<s>  i
dont know how this was </s>
<s>  i became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what
means </s>
<s> 

he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor
about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem
indicative of natural strength </s>
<s>  he had not a handsome face but it was
better than handsome </s>
<s>  being extremely amiable and cheerful </s>
<s>  his figure
was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and
young </s>
<s>  whether <abvr> trabbs local work would have sat more gracefully on
him than on me may be a question </s>
<s>  but i am conscious that he carried
off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit </s>
<s> 

as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years </s>
<s>  i therefore told him my small story
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was </s>
<s> 
i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would
take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever
he saw me at a loss or going wrong </s>
<s> 

with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that youll want
very few hints </s>
<s>  i dare say we shall be often together and i should like
to banish any needless restraint between us </s>
<s>  will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert </s>
<s> 

i thanked him and said i would </s>
<s>  i informed him in exchange that my
christian name was philip </s>
<s> 

i dont take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spellingbook who was so lazy that he fell into a pond
or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes or so avaricious that
he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a
birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood </s>
<s>  i tell you what i should like </s>
<s>  we are so harmonious and
you have been a blacksmithwould you mind it </s>
<s> 

i shouldnt mind anything that you propose i answered but i dont
understand you </s>
<s> 

would you mind handel for a familiar name </s>
<s>  theres a charming piece of
music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith </s>
<s> 

i should like it very much </s>
<s> 

then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened
here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table
because the dinner is of your providing </s>
<s> 

this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him </s>
<s>  it was a
nice little dinnerseemed to me then a very lord mayors feastand
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances with no old people by and with london all around us </s>
<s> 
this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off </s>
<s>  for while the table was as <abvr> pumblechook might have
said the lap of luxurybeing entirely furnished forth from the
coffeehousethe circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character </s>
<s>  imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he
fell over them the melted butter in the armchair the bread on the
bookshelves the cheese in the coalscuttle and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next roomwhere i found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when i retired for the night </s>
<s>  all this made the
feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my
pleasure was without alloy </s>
<s> 

we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his
promise to tell me about miss havisham </s>
<s> 

true he replied </s>
<s>  ill redeem it at once </s>
<s>  let me introduce the topic
handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouthfor fear of accidentsand that while the fork is
reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary </s>
<s>  it is
scarcely worth mentioning only its as well to do as other people do </s>
<s> 
also the spoon is not generally used overhand but under </s>
<s>  this has
two advantages </s>
<s>  you get at your mouth better which after all is the
object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on
the part of the right elbow </s>
<s> 

he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both
laughed and i scarcely blushed </s>
<s> 

now he pursued concerning miss havisham </s>
<s>  miss havisham you must
know was a spoilt child </s>
<s>  her mother died when she was a baby and her
father denied her nothing </s>
<s>  her father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world and was a brewer </s>
<s>  i dont know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer </s>
<s>  but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was
and brew </s>
<s>  you see it every day </s>
<s> 

yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse </s>
<s>  may he </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not on any account returned herbert </s>
<s>  but a publichouse may keep a
gentleman </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  <abvr> havisham was very rich and very proud </s>
<s>  so was his
daughter </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was an only child </s>
<s>  i hazarded </s>
<s> 

stop a moment i am coming to that </s>
<s>  no she was not an only child </s>
<s> 
she had a halfbrother </s>
<s>  her father privately married againhis cook i
rather think </s>
<s> 

i thought he was proud said i </s>
<s> 

my good handel so he was </s>
<s>  he married his second wife privately
because he was proud and in course of time she died </s>
<s>  when she was dead
i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then
the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are
acquainted with </s>
<s>  as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous
extravagant undutifulaltogether bad </s>
<s>  at last his father disinherited
him </s>
<s>  but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though
not nearly so well off as miss havisham </s>
<s> take another glass of wine
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose </s>
<s> 

i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital </s>
<s>  i
thanked him and apologized </s>
<s>  he said not at all and resumed </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match </s>
<s>  her halfbrother had now ample means again but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again </s>
<s> 
there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been
between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fathers anger </s>
<s> 
now i come to the cruel part of the storymerely breaking off my
dear handel to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a tumbler </s>
<s> 

why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to
say </s>
<s>  i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits </s>
<s>  again i thanked him and apologized and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure </s>
<s>  and resumed </s>
<s> 

there appeared upon the scenesay at the races or the public
balls or anywhere else you likea certain man who made love to miss
havisham </s>
<s>  i never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago
before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that
he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose </s>
<s>  but that he was
not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my
father most strongly asseverates </s>
<s>  because it is a principle of his that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world
began a true gentleman in manner </s>
<s>  he says no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood </s>
<s>  and that the more varnish you put on the more the
grain will express itself </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  this man pursued miss havisham closely
and professed to be devoted to her </s>
<s>  i believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time </s>
<s>  but all the susceptibility she possessed
certainly came out then and she passionately loved him </s>
<s>  there is no
doubt that she perfectly idolized him </s>
<s>  he practised on her affection in
that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he
induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had
been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea
that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all </s>
<s>  your
guardian was not at that time in miss havishams counsels and she was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one </s>
<s>  her relations
were poor and scheming with the exception of my father </s>
<s>  he was poor
enough but not timeserving or jealous </s>
<s>  the only independent one among
them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his power </s>
<s>  she took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his
presence and my father has never seen her since </s>
<s> 

i thought of her having said matthew will come and see me at last when
i am laid dead upon that table </s>
<s>  and i asked herbert whether his father
was so inveterate against her </s>
<s> 

its not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her
intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would
look trueeven to himand even to her </s>
<s>  to return to the man and make
an end of him </s>
<s>  the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were
bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were
invited </s>
<s>  the day came but not the bridegroom </s>
<s>  he wrote her a letter

which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her
marriage </s>
<s>  at twenty minutes to nine </s>
<s> 

at the hour and minute said herbert nodding at which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks </s>
<s>  what was in it further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i cant tell you because i
dont know </s>
<s>  when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she
laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since
looked upon the light of day </s>
<s> 

is that all the story </s>
<s>  i asked after considering it </s>
<s> 

all i know of it </s>
<s>  and indeed i only know so much through piecing it
out for myself </s>
<s>  for my father always avoids it and even when miss
havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite i should understand </s>
<s>  but i have forgotten one
thing </s>
<s>  it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother </s>
<s>  that it
was a conspiracy between them </s>
<s>  and that they shared the profits </s>
<s> 

i wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property said i </s>
<s> 

he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her halfbrothers scheme said herbert </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  i dont
know that </s>
<s> 

what became of the two men </s>
<s>  i asked after again considering the
subject </s>
<s> 

they fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be
deeperand ruin </s>
<s> 

are they alive now </s>
<s> 

i dont know </s>
<s> 

you said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but
adopted </s>
<s>  when adopted </s>
<s> 

herbert shrugged his shoulders </s>
<s>  there has always been an estella since
i have heard of a miss havisham </s>
<s>  i know no more </s>
<s>  and now handel said
he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly
open understanding between us </s>
<s>  all that i know about miss havisham you
know </s>
<s> 

and all that i know i retorted you know </s>
<s> 

i fully believe it </s>
<s>  so there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me </s>
<s>  and as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in lifenamely that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe ityou may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me </s>
<s> 

in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject
done with even though i should be under his fathers roof for years and
years to come </s>
<s>  yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt
he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as i
understood the fact myself </s>
<s> 

it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way </s>
<s>  but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this
to be the case </s>
<s>  we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the
course of conversation what he was </s>
<s>  he replied a capitalistan
insurer of ships </s>
<s>  i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city </s>
<s> 

i had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in
the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer
on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible
head open </s>
<s>  but again there came upon me for my relief that odd
impression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich </s>
<s> 

i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships </s>
<s>  i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the
direction </s>
<s>  i shall also do a little in the mining way </s>
<s>  none of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account </s>
<s>  i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to
the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious
woods </s>
<s>  its an interesting trade </s>
<s> 

and the profits are large </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

tremendous </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own </s>
<s> 

i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his
waistcoat pockets to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum </s>
<s> 
also to ceylon specially for elephants tusks </s>
<s> 

you will want a good many ships said i </s>
<s> 

a perfect fleet said he </s>
<s> 

quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him
where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present </s>
<s> 

i havent begun insuring yet he replied </s>
<s>  i am looking about me </s>
<s> 

somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnards inn </s>
<s>  i said
in a tone of conviction ahh </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  i am in a countinghouse and looking about me </s>
<s> 

is a countinghouse profitable </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

todo you mean to the young fellow whos in it </s>
<s>  he asked in reply </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  to you </s>
<s> 

why nno </s>
<s>  not to me </s>
<s>  he said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance </s>
<s>  not directly profitable </s>
<s>  that is
it doesnt pay me anything and i have tokeep myself </s>
<s> 

this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as
if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income </s>
<s> 

but the thing is said herbert pocket that you look about you </s>
<s> 
thats the grand thing </s>
<s>  you are in a countinghouse you know and you
look about you </s>
<s> 

it struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a
countinghouse you know and look about you </s>
<s>  but i silently deferred to
his experience </s>
<s> 

then the time comes said herbert when you see your opening </s>
<s>  and you
go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there
you are </s>
<s>  when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do
but employ it </s>
<s> 

this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden </s>
<s> 
very like </s>
<s>  his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded
to his manner of bearing that defeat </s>
<s>  it seemed to me that he took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine
then </s>
<s>  it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest
necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else </s>
<s> 

yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so
unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being
puffed up </s>
<s>  it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways
and we got on famously </s>
<s>  in the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets and went halfprice to the theatre </s>
<s>  and next day we went to
church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the
parks </s>
<s>  and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe did </s>
<s> 

on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had
left joe and biddy </s>
<s>  the space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off </s>
<s>  that i could
have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes on the very
last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities
geographical and social solar and lunar </s>
<s>  yet in the london streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away </s>
<s>  and in the dead of night the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnards inn
under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart </s>
<s> 

on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to
the countinghouse to report himselfto look about him too i
supposeand i bore him company </s>
<s>  he was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him </s>
<s>  it
appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning </s>
<s>  nor
did the countinghouse where herbert assisted show in my eyes as at
all a good observatory </s>
<s>  being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy
presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second
floor rather than a look out </s>
<s> 

i waited about until it was noon and i went upon ˜change and i saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to
be great merchants though i couldnt understand why they should all be
out of spirits </s>
<s>  when herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing
even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters clothes than in the steaks </s>
<s>  this collation disposed of at
a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we
went back to barnards inn and got my little portmanteau and then took
coach for hammersmith </s>
<s>  we arrived there at two or three oclock in
the afternoon and had very little way to walk to <abvr> pockets house </s>
<s> 
lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river where <abvr> pockets children were playing
about </s>
<s>  and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that <abvr> and <abvr>
pockets children were not growing up or being brought up but were
tumbling up </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with
her legs upon another garden chair </s>
<s>  and <abvr> pockets two nursemaids
were looking about them while the children played </s>
<s>  mamma said
herbert this is young <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  upon which <abvr> pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity </s>
<s> 

master alick and miss jane cried one of the nurses to two of the
children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes youll fall over
into the river and be drownded and whatll your pa say then </s>
<s> 

at the same time this nurse picked up <abvr> pockets handkerchief and
said if that dont make six times youve dropped it mum </s>
<s>  upon which
mrs </s>
<s>  pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself
in one chair only resumed her book </s>
<s>  her countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week
but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes
upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well </s>
<s>  this unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  she cried picking up the pockethandkerchief if that dont
make seven times </s>
<s>  what are you a doing of this afternoon mum </s>
<s>  <abvr>
pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of
recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on
reading </s>
<s> 

i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than
six little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up </s>
<s>  i had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region
of air wailing dolefully </s>
<s> 

if there aint baby </s>
<s>  said flopson appearing to think it most
surprising </s>
<s>  make haste up millers </s>
<s> 

millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees
the childs wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket read all the
time and i was curious to know what the book could be </s>
<s> 

we were waiting i supposed for <abvr> pocket to come out to us </s>
<s>  at any
rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near <abvr> pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over heralways very much to her momentary astonishment and
their own more enduring lamentation </s>
<s>  i was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby
which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to <abvr>
pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over <abvr> pocket baby
and all and was caught by herbert and myself </s>
<s> 

gracious me flopson </s>

moment everybodys tumbling </s>
<s>

<s>  returned flopson very red in the face </s>
<s> 
what have you got there </s>
<s> 

i got here flopson </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> pocket </s>
<s> 

why if it aint your footstool </s>
<s>  cried flopson </s>
<s>  and if you keep it
under your skirts like that whos to help tumbling </s>

<s>  take the
baby mum and give me your book </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her lap while the other children played about it </s>
<s>  this had
lasted but a very short time when <abvr> pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap </s>
<s>  thus i made the
second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little
pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down </s>
<s> 

under these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the children
into the house like a little flock of sheep and <abvr> pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that <abvr>
pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and
with his very gray hair disordered on his head as if he didnt quite
see his way to putting anything straight </s>

mr </s>

see him </s>

an alarming personage </s>
<s>  he was a younglooking man in spite of
his perplexities and his very gray hair and his manner seemed quite
natural </s>
<s>  i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected </s>
<s> 
there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very
near being so </s>
<s>  when he had talked with me a little he said to <abvr>
pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were
black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  and she
looked up from her book and said yes </s>
<s>  she then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orangeflower
water </s>
<s>  as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone
or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like
her previous approaches in general conversational condescension </s>
<s> 

i found out within a few hours and may mention at once that <abvr>
pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
father would have been made a baronet but for somebodys determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motivesi forget whose
if i ever knewthe sovereigns the prime ministers the lord
chancellors the archbishop of canterburys anybodysand had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact </s>
<s>  i believe he had been knighted himself for storming
the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the
trowel or the mortar </s>
<s>  be that as it may he had directed <abvr> pocket to
be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge </s>
<s> 

so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but
perfectly helpless and useless </s>
<s>  with her character thus happily formed
in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered <abvr> pocket </s>
<s>  who was
also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount
to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre </s>
<s>  as his doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time he and <abvr> pocket had
taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would
seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent </s>
<s>  the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle and had informed <abvr> pocket that his wife was a
treasure for a prince </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket had invested the princes treasure
in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest </s>
<s>  still <abvr> pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married
a title </s>
<s>  while <abvr> pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach because he had never got one </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket took me into the house and showed me my room </s>
<s>  which was a
pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for
my own private sittingroom </s>
<s>  he then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle
and startop </s>
<s>  drummle an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of
architecture was whistling </s>
<s>  startop younger in years and appearance
was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge </s>
<s> 

both <abvr> and <abvr> pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
elses hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the
servants </s>
<s>  it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving
trouble </s>
<s>  but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs </s>
<s>  they allowed a very
liberal table to <abvr> and <abvr> pocket yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchenalways supposing the boarder capable of selfdefence for
before i had been there a week a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers
slapping the baby </s>
<s>  this greatly distressed <abvr> pocket who burst into
tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldnt mind their own business </s>
<s> 

by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that <abvr> pocket had been
educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself </s>
<s> 
but that when he had had the happiness of marrying <abvr> pocket very
early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling
of a grinder </s>

remarkable that their fathers when influential were always going to

left the grindstonehe had wearied of that poor work and had come to
london </s>
<s>  here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read

acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction

mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> pocket had a toady neighbor </s>
<s>  a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody

<s>  this
ladys name was <abvr> coiler and i had the honor of taking her down to
dinner on the day of my installation </s>
<s>  she gave me to understand on the
stairs that it was a blow to dear <abvr> pocket that dear <abvr> pocket

<s> 
that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence
at that time i had known her something less than five minutes </s>
<s>  if
they were all like me it would be quite another thing </s>

disappointment not that dear <abvr> pocket was to blame in that requires
so much luxury and elegance

yes maam i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to
cry </s>
<s> 

and she is of so aristocratic a disposition

i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butchers time

manners </s>
<s> 

it came to my knowledge through what passed between <abvr> pocket and
drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and
other instruments of selfdestruction that drummle whose christian
name was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy </s>
<s> 
it further appeared that the book i had seen <abvr> pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which
her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all </s>

drummle didnt say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognized <abvr> pocket
as a woman and a sister </s>

neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it
appeared to me that it was painful to herbert </s>

a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction </s>
<s>  it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef </s>
<s>  to my
unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw <abvr> pocket
relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and
with which i soon became as familiar as the rest </s>
<s>  he laid down the
carvingknife and forkbeing engaged in carving at the momentput
his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it </s>
<s>  when he had done this
and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he
was about </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me </s>
<s>  i liked
it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over </s>
<s>  she had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities i had left which was altogether snaky and forktongued </s>
<s>  and
when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to
her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table </s>

after dinner the children were introduced and <abvr> coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes noses and legsa sagacious way of improving
their minds </s>
<s>  there were four little girls and two little boys besides
the baby who might have been either and the babys next successor who
was as yet neither </s>
<s>  they were brought in by flopson and millers much as

to make of them </s>

upon the table </s>

concussion </s>

dear dear </s>

<s> 

one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place
by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and
laughed </s>
<s>  then all the children laughed and <abvr> pocket who in the
meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed
and we all laughed and were glad </s>
<s> 

flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll
then got it safely into <abvr> pockets lap and gave it the nutcrackers
to play with </s>
<s>  at the same time recommending <abvr> pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
eyes and sharply charging miss jane to look after the same </s>
<s>  then the
two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost
half his buttons at the gamingtable </s>
<s> 

i was made very uneasy in my mind by <abvr> pockets falling into a
discussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the
baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers </s>
<s>  at
length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly
left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous
weapon away </s>

exclaimed to the elements </s>

and became silent </s>

we all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on </s>
<s>  a
pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
series of leaps and crows at little jane who appeared to me to be the
only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had
any decided acquaintance </s>

its point after all for i saw it through the window within a few
minutes being nursed by little jane </s>

it happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinnertable through flopsons having some private engagement and
their not being anybody elses business </s>
<s>  i thus became aware of the
mutual relations between them and <abvr> pocket which were exemplified in
the following manner </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket with the normal perplexity of his face
heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if

establishment and why they hadnt been billeted by nature on

<s>  then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain
questionsas why little joe had that hole in his frill who said pa

when she didnt forget </s>

gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play </s>

circumstances </s>
<s>  i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary </s>

should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his </s>
<s>  through his way
of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on

mine with him </s>
<s>  if he had shown indifference as a master i have no doubt
i should have returned the compliment as a pupil </s>

excuse and each of us did the other justice </s>

him as having anything ludicrous about himor anything but what was
serious honest and goodin his tutor communication with me </s>

not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could

put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s> 

did that other creature come to the same end </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s>  he has the
same look </s>
<s> 

youre right said wemmick </s>
<s>  its the genuine look </s>
<s>  much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook </s>
<s>  yes
he came to the same end </s>
<s>  quite the natural end here i assure you </s>
<s> 
he forged wills this blade did if he didnt also put the supposed
testators to sleep too </s>
<s>  you were a gentlemanly cove though <abvr>
wemmick was again apostrophizing and you said you could write greek </s>
<s> 
yah bounceable </s>
<s>  what a liar you were </s>
<s>  i never met such a liar as you </s>
<s> 
 before putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the
largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only
the day before </s>
<s> 

while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair
the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
from like sources </s>
<s>  as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i
ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before
me dusting his hands </s>
<s> 

o yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind </s>
<s>  one brings
another you see </s>
<s>  thats the way of it </s>
<s>  i always take ˜em </s>
<s>  theyre
curiosities </s>
<s>  and theyre property </s>
<s>  they may not be worth much but
after all theyre property and portable </s>
<s>  it dont signify to you with
your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guidingstar always is
˜get hold of portable property </s>
<s> 

when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a
friendly manner </s>
<s> 

if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldnt
mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i
should consider it an honor </s>
<s>  i have not much to show you </s>
<s>  but such two
or three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over </s>
<s>  and i am
fond of a bit of garden and a summerhouse </s>

i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality </s>

convenient to you </s>

well said wemmick hell give you wine and good wine </s>

punch and not bad punch </s>

<s>  when you go
to dine with <abvr> jaggers look at his housekeeper </s>
<s> 

shall i see something very uncommon </s>
<s> 

well said wemmick youll see a wild beast tamed </s>
<s>  not so very
uncommon youll tell me </s>
<s>  i reply that depends on the original wildness
of the beast and the amount of taming </s>
<s>  it wont lower your opinion of
mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss powers </s>
<s>  keep your eye on it </s>
<s> 

i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened </s>
<s>  as i was taking my departure he asked me if i
would like to devote five minutes to seeing <abvr> jaggers at it </s>
<s> 

for several reasons and not least because i didnt clearly know what
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative </s>
<s> 
we dived into the city and came up in a crowded policecourt where
a bloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the

his finger </s>

side he was on i couldnt make out for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill </s>
<s>  i only know that when i stole out on tiptoe
he was not on the side of the bench </s>

acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit </s>
<s>  heavy in figure movement
and comprehensionin the sluggish complexion of his face and in
the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a roomhe was idle proud niggardly
reserved and suspicious </s>
<s>  he came of rich people down in somersetshire
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead </s>
<s>  thus bentley drummle
had come to <abvr> pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen </s>
<s> 

startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he
ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and
admired her beyond measure </s>
<s>  he had a womans delicacy of feature
and wasas you may see though you never saw her said herbert to
meexactly like his mother </s>
<s>  it was but natural that i should take to
him much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest
evenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one
another conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up
in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes </s>
<s>  he
would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature
even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way </s>
<s>  and i always
think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
midstream </s>
<s> 

herbert was my intimate companion and friend </s>
<s>  i presented him with a
halfshare in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down
to hammersmith </s>
<s>  and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often
took me up to london </s>
<s>  we used to walk between the two places at all
hours </s>
<s>  i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope </s>
<s> 

when i had been in <abvr> pockets family a month or two <abvr> and <abvr>
camilla turned up </s>
<s>  camilla was <abvr> pockets sister </s>
<s>  georgiana whom i
had seen at miss havishams on the same occasion also turned up </s>
<s>  she
was a cousinan indigestive single woman who called her rigidity
religion and her liver love </s>
<s>  these people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment </s>
<s>  as a matter of course they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness </s>
<s>  towards <abvr> pocket as
a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the
complacent forbearance i had heard them express </s>
<s>  <abvr> pocket they
held in contempt </s>
<s>  but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves </s>
<s> 

these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied
myself to my education </s>
<s>  i soon contracted expensive habits and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have
thought almost fabulous </s>
<s>  but through good and evil i stuck to my books </s>
<s> 
there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies </s>
<s>  between <abvr> pocket and herbert i got on fast </s>
<s>  and with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and
clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as
drummle if i had done less </s>
<s> 

i had not seen <abvr> wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write
him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening </s>
<s>  he
replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect
me at the office at six oclock </s>
<s>  thither i went and there i found him
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck </s>
<s> 

did you think of walking down to walworth </s>

certainly said i if you approve </s>

very much was wemmicks reply for i have had my legs under the desk
all day and shall be glad to stretch them </s>
<s>  now ill tell you what i
have got for supper <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i have got a stewed steakwhich is
of home preparationand a cold roast fowlwhich is from the
cooksshop </s>
<s>  i think its tender because the master of the shop was a
juryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy </s>
<s> 
i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out
a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two we could easily have done it </s>
<s>  he said to that
let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop </s>
<s>  i let him of
course </s>
<s>  as far as it goes its property and portable </s>
<s>  you dont object
to an aged parent i hope </s>
<s> 

i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added
because i have got an aged parent at my place </s>
<s>  i then said what
politeness required </s>
<s> 

so you havent dined with <abvr> jaggers yet </s>
<s>  he pursued as we walked
along </s>

not yet </s>

well hes going to ask the whole gangi hardly felt complimented by
the wordand whatever he gives you hell give you good </s>
<s>  dont look
forward to variety but youll have excellence </s>

thing in his house proceeded wemmick after a moments pause as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood </s>

or window be fastened at night </s>
<s> 

is he never robbed </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  returned wemmick </s>

want to see the man wholl rob me </s>
<s>  lord bless you i have heard him a
hundred times if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our
front office you know where i live </s>
<s>  now no bolt is ever drawn there </s>
<s> 
why dont you do a stroke of business with me </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  cant i tempt you </s>
<s> 
 not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or
money </s>
<s> 

they dread him so much </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

dread him said wemmick </s>
<s>  i believe you they dread him </s>
<s>  not but what
hes artful even in his defiance of them </s>
<s>  no silver sir </s>
<s>  britannia
metal every spoon </s>
<s> 

so they wouldnt have much i observed even if they

ah </s>
<s>  but he would have much said wemmick cutting me short and they
know it </s>
<s>  hed have their lives and the lives of scores of ˜em </s>
<s>  hed
have all he could get </s>
<s>  and its impossible to say what he couldnt get
if he gave his mind to it </s>
<s> 

i was falling into meditation on my guardians greatness when wemmick
remarked </s>
<s> 

as to the absence of plate thats only his natural depth you know </s>
<s> 
a rivers its natural depth and hes his natural depth </s>
<s>  look at his
watchchain </s>
<s>  thats real enough </s>
<s> 

its very massive said i </s>
<s> 

massive </s>
<s>  repeated wemmick </s>
<s>  i think so </s>
<s>  and his watch is a gold
repeater and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch </s>
<s>  theres not a man a woman or a child among them who
wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it
was red hot if inveigled into touching it </s>
<s> 

at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature did <abvr> wemmick and i beguile the time and the road
until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
walworth </s>
<s> 

it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little
gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement </s>
<s> 
wemmicks house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns </s>
<s> 

my own doing said wemmick </s>
<s>  looks pretty </s>
<s>  dont it </s>
<s> 

i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw </s>
<s> 
with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at </s>
<s> 

thats a real flagstaff you see said wemmick and on sundays i
run up a real flag </s>
<s>  then look here </s>
<s>  after i have crossed this bridge i
hoist it upsoand cut off the communication </s>
<s> 

the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep </s>
<s>  but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he
hoisted it up and made it fast </s>
<s>  smiling as he did so with a relish and
not merely mechanically </s>
<s> 

at nine oclock every night greenwich time said wemmick the gun
fires </s>
<s>  there he is you see </s>
<s>  and when you hear him go i think youll
say hes a stinger </s>
<s> 

the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress
constructed of latticework </s>
<s>  it was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella </s>
<s> 

then at the back said wemmick out of sight so as not to impede
the idea of fortificationsfor its a principle with me if you have
an idea carry it out and keep it upi dont know whether thats your
opinion

i said decidedly </s>
<s> 

at the back theres a pig and there are fowls and rabbits </s>
<s>  then
i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers </s>
<s>  and
youll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise </s>
<s>  so sir said
wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you
can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions </s>
<s> 

then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at </s>
<s>  and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth </s>
<s> 
our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower
was raised </s>
<s>  this piece of water with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had
constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet </s>
<s> 

i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and
my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said wemmick in
acknowledging my compliments </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s>  its a good thing you know </s>
<s>  it
brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged </s>
<s>  you wouldnt
mind being at once introduced to the aged would you </s>
<s>  it wouldnt put
you out </s>
<s> 

i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle </s>
<s>  there
we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat </s>
<s>  clean
cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf </s>
<s> 

well aged parent said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial
and jocose way how am you </s>
<s> 

all right john </s>
<s>  all right </s>
<s>  replied the old man </s>
<s> 

heres <abvr> pip aged parent said wemmick and i wish you could hear
his name </s>
<s>  nod away at him <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  thats what he likes </s>
<s>  nod away at
him if you please like winking </s>
<s> 

this is a fine place of my sons sir cried the old man while i
nodded as hard as i possibly could </s>
<s>  this is a pretty pleasureground
sir </s>
<s>  this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the nation after my sons time for the peoples
enjoyment </s>
<s> 

youre as proud of it as punch </s>
<s>  aint you aged </s>
<s>  said wemmick
contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened </s>
<s>  theres
a nod for you </s>
<s>  giving him a tremendous one </s>
<s>  theres another for you </s>
<s> 
 giving him a still more tremendous one </s>
<s>  you like that dont you </s>
<s>  if
youre not tired <abvr> pipthough i know its tiring to strangerswill
you tip him one more </s>
<s>  you cant think how it pleases him </s>
<s> 

i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits </s>
<s>  we left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor </s>
<s>  where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken
him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection </s>
<s> 

is it your own <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

o yes said wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time </s>
<s>  its a
freehold by george </s>
<s> 

is it indeed </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> jaggers admires it </s>
<s> 

never seen it said wemmick </s>
<s>  never heard of it </s>
<s>  never seen the aged </s>
<s> 
never heard of him </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  the office is one thing and private life is
another </s>
<s>  when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and
when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me </s>
<s>  if its not
in any way disagreeable to you youll oblige me by doing the same </s>
<s>  i
dont wish it professionally spoken about </s>
<s> 

of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request </s>
<s>  the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and
talking until it was almost nine oclock </s>
<s>  getting near gunfire said
wemmick then as he laid down his pipe </s>
<s>  its the ageds treat </s>
<s> 

proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker
with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony </s>
<s>  wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the
moment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the aged and
repair to the battery </s>
<s>  he took it and went out and presently the
stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in
it ring </s>
<s>  upon this the agedwho i believe would have been blown out
of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly
hes fired </s>
<s>  i heerd him </s>
<s>  and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him </s>
<s> 

the interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing
me his collection of curiosities </s>
<s>  they were mostly of a felonious
character </s>
<s>  comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnationupon which <abvr>
wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one
of ˜em lies sir </s>
<s>  these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum and some tobaccostoppers carved by the aged </s>
<s>  they were all
displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first
inducted and which served not only as the general sittingroom but
as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roastingjack </s>
<s> 

there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in
the day </s>
<s>  when she had laid the suppercloth the bridge was lowered to
give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night </s>
<s>  the supper was
excellent </s>
<s>  and though the castle was rather subject to dryrot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been
farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment </s>
<s>  nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down
on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night </s>
<s> 

wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him
cleaning my boots </s>
<s>  after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from
my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in
a most devoted manner </s>
<s>  our breakfast was as good as the supper and at
halfpast eight precisely we started for little britain </s>
<s>  by degrees
wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened
into a postoffice again </s>
<s>  at last when we got to his place of business
and he pulled out his key from his coatcollar he looked as unconscious
of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the stinger </s>

chapter xxvi

it fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardians establishment with that of his
cashier and clerk </s>
<s>  my guardian was in his room washing his hands with
his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth </s>
<s>  and he
called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which wemmick had prepared me to receive </s>
<s>  no ceremony he stipulated
and no dinner dress and say tomorrow </s>
<s>  i asked him where we should
come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his
general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied
come here and ill take you home with me </s>
<s>  i embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or
a dentist </s>
<s>  he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumers shop </s>
<s>  it had an unusually
large jacktowel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his
hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room </s>
<s>  when i and
my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found
him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands
but laving his face and gargling his throat </s>
<s>  and even when he had
done all that and had gone all round the jacktowel he took out his
penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat
on </s>
<s> 

there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him </s>
<s>  but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his presence that they gave it up for that day </s>
<s>  as we walked along
westward he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me </s>
<s>  but
he never otherwise recognized anybody or took notice that anybody
recognized him </s>
<s> 

he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of
that street </s>
<s>  rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want
of painting and with dirty windows </s>
<s>  he took out his key and opened the
door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used </s>
<s> 
so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor </s>
<s>  there were carved garlands on the panelled walls and
as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i
thought they looked like </s>
<s> 

dinner was laid in the best of these rooms </s>
<s>  the second was his
dressingroom </s>
<s>  the third his bedroom </s>
<s>  he told us that he held the whole
house but rarely used more of it than we saw </s>
<s>  the table was comfortably
laidno silver in the service of courseand at the side of his chair
was a capacious dumbwaiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it and four dishes of fruit for dessert </s>
<s>  i noticed throughout that he
kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself </s>
<s> 

there was a bookcase in the room </s>
<s>  i saw from the backs of the books
that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials
acts of parliament and such things </s>
<s>  the furniture was all very solid
and good like his watchchain </s>
<s>  it had an official look however and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen </s>
<s>  in a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp </s>
<s>  so that he seemed to bring the
office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work </s>
<s> 

as he had scarcely seen my three companions until nowfor he and i had
walked togetherhe stood on the hearthrug after ringing the bell
and took a searching look at them </s>
<s>  to my surprise he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in drummle </s>
<s> 

pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window i dont know one from the other </s>
<s>  whos the spider </s>
<s> 

the spider </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow </s>
<s> 

thats bentley drummle i replied </s>
<s>  the one with the delicate face is
startop </s>
<s> 

not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he
returned bentley drummle is his name is it </s>
<s>  i like the look of that
fellow </s>
<s> 

he immediately began to talk to drummle </s>
<s>  not at all deterred by his
replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him </s>
<s>  i was looking at the two when there came between
me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table </s>
<s> 

she was a woman of about forty i supposedbut i may have thought her
younger than she was </s>
<s>  rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely
pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair </s>
<s>  i cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter </s>
<s>  but i know that i had been to see macbeth at
the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had seen rise out
of the witches caldron </s>
<s> 

she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished </s>
<s>  we took our seats
at the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him
while startop sat on the other </s>
<s>  it was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird </s>
<s>  sauces wines all
the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our
host from his dumbwaiter </s>
<s>  and when they had made the circuit of the
table he always put them back again </s>
<s>  similarly he dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair </s>
<s>  no other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared </s>
<s>  she set on every dish </s>
<s>  and i always saw
in her face a face rising out of the caldron </s>
<s>  years afterwards i made
a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room </s>
<s> 

induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her
own striking appearance and by wemmicks preparation i observed
that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and
wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say </s>
<s>  i
fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a
purpose of always holding her in suspense </s>
<s> 

dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us </s>
<s>  for myself i found that i was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronize herbert and to boast
of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips </s>
<s> 
it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle </s>
<s>  the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off </s>
<s> 

it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his </s>
<s> 
drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to
our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that
as to strength he could scatter us like chaff </s>
<s>  by some invisible agency
my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle </s>
<s>  and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular
it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner </s>
<s> 

now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table </s>
<s>  my guardian
taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her
was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
showing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable </s>
<s> 
suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeepers like a trap
as she stretched it across the table </s>
<s>  so suddenly and smartly did he do
this that we all stopped in our foolish contention </s>
<s> 

if you talk of strength said <abvr> jaggers ill show you a wrist </s>
<s> 
molly let them see your wrist </s>
<s> 

her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other
hand behind her waist </s>
<s>  master she said in a low voice with her eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him </s>
<s>  dont </s>
<s> 

ill show you a wrist repeated <abvr> jaggers with an immovable
determination to show it </s>
<s>  molly let them see your wrist </s>
<s> 

master she again murmured </s>
<s>  please </s>
<s> 

molly said <abvr> jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists </s>
<s>  show
them </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s> 

he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table </s>
<s>  she
brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by
side </s>
<s>  the last wrist was much disfigureddeeply scarred and scarred
across and across </s>
<s>  when she held her hands out she took her eyes from
mr </s>
<s>  jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession </s>
<s> 

theres power here said <abvr> jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews
with his forefinger </s>
<s>  very few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has </s>
<s>  its remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands </s>
<s>  i have had occasion to notice many hands </s>
<s>  but i never saw
stronger in that respect mans or womans than these </s>
<s> 

while he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat </s>
<s>  the moment
he ceased she looked at him again </s>
<s>  thatll do molly said <abvr>
jaggers giving her a slight nod </s>
<s>  you have been admired and can
go </s>
<s>  she withdrew her hands and went out of the room and <abvr> jaggers
putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter filled his glass and
passed round the wine </s>
<s> 

at halfpast nine gentlemen said he we must break up </s>
<s>  pray make
the best use of your time </s>
<s>  i am glad to see you all </s>
<s>  <abvr> drummle i
drink to you </s>
<s> 

if his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more
it perfectly succeeded </s>
<s>  in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose
depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree
until he became downright intolerable </s>
<s>  through all his stages <abvr>
jaggers followed him with the same strange interest </s>
<s>  he actually seemed
to serve as a zest to <abvr> jaggerss wine </s>
<s> 

in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink
and i know we talked too much </s>
<s>  we became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of drummles to the effect that we were too free with our
money </s>
<s>  it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it
came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before </s>
<s> 

well retorted drummle </s>
<s>  hell be paid </s>
<s> 

i dont mean to imply that he wont said i but it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money i should think </s>
<s> 

you should think </s>
<s>  retorted drummle </s>
<s>  oh lord </s>
<s> 

i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldnt
lend money to any of us if we wanted it </s>
<s> 

you are right said drummle </s>
<s>  i wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence </s>
<s>  i
wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence </s>
<s> 

rather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should say </s>
<s> 

you should say repeated drummle </s>
<s>  oh lord </s>
<s> 

this was so very aggravatingthe more especially as i found myself
making no way against his surly obtusenessthat i said disregarding
herberts efforts to check me

come <abvr> drummle since we are on the subject ill tell you what
passed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that money </s>
<s> 

i dont want to know what passed between herbert there and you
 growled drummle </s>
<s>  and i think he added in a lower growl that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves </s>
<s> 

ill tell you however said i whether you want to know or not </s>
<s>  we
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed
to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it </s>
<s> 

drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands
in his pockets and his round shoulders raised </s>
<s>  plainly signifying that
it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all </s>
<s> 

hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than
i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable </s>
<s>  startop
being a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact
opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
personal affront </s>
<s>  he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh </s>
<s>  resenting this little success more than anything drummle
without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets
dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would
have flung it at his adversarys head but for our entertainers
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose </s>
<s> 

gentlemen said <abvr> jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and
hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly
sorry to announce that its half past nine </s>
<s> 

on this hint we all rose to depart </s>
<s>  before we got to the street door
startop was cheerily calling drummle old boy as if nothing had
happened </s>
<s>  but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not
even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way </s>
<s>  so herbert and i
who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides </s>
<s> 
startop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses
much as he was wont to follow in his boat </s>
<s> 

as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for
a moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian </s>
<s>  i found
him in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots already hard
at it washing his hands of us </s>
<s> 

i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame
me much </s>
<s> 

pooh </s>
<s>  said he sluicing his face and speaking through the
waterdrops </s>
<s>  its nothing pip </s>
<s>  i like that spider though </s>
<s> 

he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and
towelling himself </s>
<s> 

i am glad you like him sir said ibut i dont </s>
<s> 

no no my guardian assented </s>
<s>  dont have too much to do with him </s>
<s> 
keep as clear of him as you can </s>
<s>  but i like the fellow pip </s>
<s>  he is one
of the true sort </s>
<s>  why if i was a fortuneteller

looking out of the towel he caught my eye </s>
<s> 

but i am not a fortuneteller he said letting his head drop into a
festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears </s>
<s>  you know what i
am dont you </s>
<s>  good night pip </s>
<s> 

good night sir </s>

in about a month after that the spiders time with <abvr> pocket was up
for good and to the great relief of all the house but <abvr> pocket he

chapter xxvii


my dear mr pip </s>
<s> 

i write this by request of <abvr> gargery for to let you know that he
is going to london in company with <abvr> wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you </s>

tuesday morning at nine oclock when if not agreeable please leave
word </s>
<s>  your poor sister is much the same as when you left </s>
<s>  we talk of you
in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing </s>
<s>  if
now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of
poor old days </s>
<s>  no more dear <abvr> pip from your ever obliged and
affectionate servant

biddy </s>
<s> 

p </s>
<s> s </s>
<s>  he wishes me most particular to write what larks </s>
<s>  he says you will
understand </s>
<s>  i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him
even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a
worthy worthy man </s>
<s>  i have read him all excepting only the last little
sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks </s>
<s> 

i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its
appointment was for next day </s>
<s>  let me confess exactly with what feelings
i looked forward to joes coming </s>
<s> 

not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of
incongruity </s>
<s>  if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly
would have paid money </s>
<s>  my greatest reassurance was that he was coming
to barnards inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall
in bentley drummles way </s>
<s>  i had little objection to his being seen by
herbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect </s>
<s>  but i had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in
contempt </s>
<s>  so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise </s>
<s> 

i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those
wrestles with barnard proved to be </s>
<s>  by this time the rooms were
vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer </s>
<s>  i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy
in bootstop bootsin bondage and slavery to whom i might have been
said to pass my days </s>
<s>  for after i had made the monster out of the
refuse of my washerwomans family and had clothed him with a blue
coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots
already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal
to eat </s>
<s>  and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my
existence </s>
<s> 

this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday
morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for
floorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought joe would like </s>
<s>  while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being
so interested and considerate i had an odd halfprovoked sense of
suspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he wouldnt
have been quite so brisk about it </s>
<s> 

however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and
i got up early in the morning and caused the sittingroom and
breakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance </s>
<s>  unfortunately
the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak
giant of a sweep </s>
<s> 

as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on
the staircase </s>
<s>  i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs
his state boots being always too big for himand by the time
it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his ascent </s>
<s>  when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards
distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole </s>
<s>  finally he gave a
faint single rap and peppersuch was the compromising name of the
avenging boyannounced <abvr> gargery </s>
<s>  i thought he never would have
done wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the
mat but at last he came in </s>
<s> 

joe how are you joe </s>
<s> 

pip how air you pip </s>
<s> 

with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put
down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down as if i had been the lastpatented pump </s>
<s> 

i am glad to see you joe </s>
<s>  give me your hat </s>
<s> 

but joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a birdsnest with
eggs in it wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way </s>
<s> 

which you have that growed said joe and that swelled and that
gentlefolked </s>
<s>  joe considered a little before he discovered this word </s>
<s> 
as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country </s>
<s> 

and you joe look wonderfully well </s>
<s> 

thank god said joe im ekerval to most </s>
<s>  and your sister shes
no worse than she were </s>
<s>  and biddy shes ever right and ready </s>
<s>  and all
friends is no backerder if not no forarder </s>
<s>  ˜ceptin wopsle </s>
<s>  hes had a
drop </s>
<s> 

all this time still with both hands taking great care of the
birdsnest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown </s>
<s> 

had a drop joe </s>
<s> 

why yes said joe lowering his voice hes left the church and went
into the playacting </s>
<s>  which the playacting have likeways brought him
to london along with me </s>
<s>  and his wish were said joe getting the
birdsnest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an
egg with his right </s>
<s>  if no offence as i would ˜and you that </s>
<s> 

i took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled playbill of
a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that
very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles </s>
<s> 

were you at his performance joe </s>
<s>  i inquired </s>
<s> 

i were said joe with emphasis and solemnity </s>
<s> 

was there a great sensation </s>
<s> 

why said joe yes there certainly were a peck of orangepeel </s>
<s> 
partickler when he see the ghost </s>
<s>  though i put it to yourself sir
whether it were calclated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with
amen </s>
<s>  a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said
joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but
that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time </s>
<s>  which i
meantersay if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to
claim his attention what can sir </s>
<s>  still more when his mourning ˜at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off try to keep it on how you may </s>
<s> 

a ghostseeing effect in joes own countenance informed me that herbert
had entered the room </s>
<s>  so i presented joe to herbert who held out his
hand </s>
<s>  but joe backed from it and held on by the birdsnest </s>
<s> 

your servant sir said joe which i hope as you and piphere his
eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family that i frowned it down and confused him morei meantersay you
two gentlemenwhich i hope as you get your elths in this close spot </s>
<s> 
for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions
 said joe confidentially and i believe its character do stand it </s>
<s>  but i
wouldnt keep a pig in it myselfnot in the case that i wished him to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him </s>
<s> 

having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwellingplace and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
sir joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hatas if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting placeand ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimneypiece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals </s>
<s> 

do you take tea or coffee <abvr> gargery </s>
<s>  asked herbert who always
presided of a morning </s>
<s> 

thankee sir said joe stiff from head to foot ill take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself </s>
<s> 

what do you say to coffee </s>
<s> 

thankee sir returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal
since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy
to your own opinions </s>
<s>  but dont you never find it a little ˜eating </s>
<s> 

say tea then said herbert pouring it out </s>
<s> 

here joes hat tumbled off the mantelpiece and he started out of his
chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot </s>
<s>  as if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon </s>
<s> 

when did you come to town <abvr> gargery </s>
<s> 

were it yesterday afternoon </s>
<s>  said joe after coughing behind his hand
as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came </s>
<s>  no
it were not </s>
<s>  yes it were </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  it were yesterday afternoon with an
appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality </s>
<s> 

have you seen anything of london yet </s>
<s> 

why yes sir said joe me and wopsle went off straight to look at
the blacking wareus </s>
<s>  but we didnt find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors </s>
<s>  which i meantersay added joe in
an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral </s>
<s> 

i really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but
for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which
was toppling </s>
<s>  indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a
quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicketkeeping </s>
<s> 
he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill </s>
<s>  now
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped </s>
<s>  now merely stopping
it midway beating it up and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall
before he felt it safe to close with it </s>
<s>  finally splashing it into the
slopbasin where i took the liberty of laying hands upon it </s>
<s> 

as to his shirtcollar and his coatcollar they were perplexing to
reflect uponinsoluble mysteries both </s>
<s>  why should a man scrape himself
to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed </s>
<s>  why
should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his holiday clothes </s>
<s>  then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth </s>
<s>  had
his eyes attracted in such strange directions </s>
<s>  was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs </s>
<s>  sat so far from the table and dropped so much
more than he ate and pretended that he hadnt dropped it </s>
<s>  that i was
heartily glad when herbert left us for the city </s>
<s> 

i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have
been easier with me </s>
<s>  i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him </s>
<s> 
in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head </s>
<s> 

us two being now alone sirbegan joe </s>
<s> 

joe i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir </s>
<s> 

joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach </s>
<s>  utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars
were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look </s>

us two being now alone resumed joe and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now concludeleastways
beginto mention what have led to my having had the present honor </s>
<s>  for
was it not said joe with his old air of lucid exposition that my
only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen </s>

i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance
against this tone </s>

well sir pursued joe this is how it were </s>

chapter xxviii

it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first
flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joes </s>
<s> 
but when i had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach and had been
down to <abvr> pockets and back i was not by any means convinced on the
last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the blue boar </s>
<s>  i should be an inconvenience at joes </s>
<s>  i was not
expected and my bed would not be ready </s>
<s>  i should be too far from
miss havishams and she was exacting and mightnt like it </s>
<s>  all other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers and with such
pretences did i cheat myself </s>
<s>  surely a curious thing </s>
<s>  that i should
innocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elses manufacture is
reasonable enough </s>
<s>  but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money </s>
<s>  an obliging stranger under pretence of
compactly folding up my banknotes for securitys sake abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells </s>
<s>  but what is his sleight of hand to mine
when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes </s>
<s> 

having settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger </s>
<s>  it was
tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots
in the archway of the blue boars postingyard </s>
<s>  it was almost solemn to
imagine him casually produced in the tailors shop and confounding
the disrespectful senses of trabbs boy </s>
<s>  on the other hand trabbs boy
might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things </s>
<s>  or reckless
and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high
street </s>
<s>  my patroness too might hear of him and not approve </s>
<s>  on the
whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind </s>
<s> 

it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter
had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark </s>
<s>  our time of starting from the cross keys was
two oclock </s>
<s>  i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare
attended by the avengerif i may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he could possibly help it </s>
<s> 

at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dockyards
by stagecoach </s>
<s>  as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised
when herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me </s>
<s>  but i had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict </s>
<s> 

you dont mind them handel </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s> 

o no </s>
<s> 

i thought you seemed as if you didnt like them </s>
<s> 

i cant pretend that i do like them and i suppose you dont
particularly </s>

see </s>
<s>  there they are said herbert coming out of the tap </s>
<s>  what a
degraded and vile sight it is </s>
<s> 

they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler
with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands </s>
<s> 
the two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their
legsirons of a pattern that i knew well </s>
<s>  they wore the dress that i
likewise knew well </s>
<s>  their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried
a thickknobbed bludgeon under his arm </s>
<s>  but he was on terms of good
understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at
the puttingto of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the
curator </s>
<s>  one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared
as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world
both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of
clothes </s>
<s>  his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes
and his attire disguised him absurdly </s>
<s>  but i knew his halfclosed eye
at one glance </s>
<s>  there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the
three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun </s>
<s> 

it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
never seen me in his life </s>
<s>  he looked across at me and his eye appraised
my watchchain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle and looked at something else </s>
<s>  the great
numbers on their backs as if they were street doors </s>
<s>  their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals </s>
<s>  their ironed
legs apologetically garlanded with pockethandkerchiefs </s>
<s>  and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them </s>
<s>  made them as
herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle </s>
<s> 

but this was not the worst of it </s>
<s>  it came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman </s>
<s>  hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the
fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous
company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and
shameful and i dont know what else </s>
<s>  at this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and
the prisoners had come over with their keeperbringing with them that
curious flavor of breadpoultice baize ropeyarn and hearthstone
which attends the convict presence </s>
<s> 

dont take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger </s>
<s>  ill sit next you myself </s>
<s>  ill put ˜em on the outside of
the row </s>
<s>  they wont interfere with you sir </s>
<s>  you neednt know theyre
there </s>
<s> 

and dont blame me growled the convict i had recognized </s>
<s>  i dont
want to go </s>
<s>  i am quite ready to stay behind </s>
<s>  as fur as i am concerned
any ones welcome to my place </s>
<s> 

or mine said the other gruffly </s>
<s>  i wouldnt have incommoded none
of you if id had my way </s>
<s>  then they both laughed and began cracking
nuts and spitting the shells about </s>
<s> as i really think i should have
liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised </s>
<s> 

at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman
and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind </s>
<s>  so he
got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the
place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could and the convict i had recognized sat behind me with his breath on
the hair of my head </s>
<s> 

goodbye handel </s>
<s>  herbert called out as we started </s>
<s>  i thought what a
blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convicts
breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine </s>
<s>  the
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid it set my very teeth on edge </s>
<s>  he seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in
doing it </s>
<s>  and i was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him off </s>
<s> 

the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold </s>
<s>  it made us
all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the halfway
house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent </s>
<s>  i dozed
off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him
and how it could best be done </s>
<s>  in the act of dipping forward as if i
were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the
question up again </s>
<s> 

but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although
i could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us </s>
<s>  cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind the convicts were closer to me than before </s>
<s>  the very first
words i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of
my own thought two one pound notes </s>

dockyard˜youre a going to be discharged </s>

they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually
growled themselves out and had nothing left to say </s>
<s> 

after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity </s>
<s>  indeed i was not
only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could
have known me without accidental help </s>
<s>  still the coincidence of our
being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his
hearing with my name </s>
<s>  for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing </s>
<s>  this device i
executed successfully </s>
<s>  my little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet </s>

me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement </s>

i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me </s>
<s>  as i walked on to
the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble </s>
<s>  i am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood </s>

the coffeeroom at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered

paragraph </s>

respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed

look at the house as i passed </s>

windows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich

of it and the heart of it of course </s>
<s>  but though she had taken such
strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been
allpowerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any
attributes save those she possessed </s>
<s>  i mention this in this place of a
fixed purpose because it is the clew by which i am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth </s>
<s>  according to my experience the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true </s>
<s>  the unqualified truth is that when i
loved estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found
her irresistible </s>
<s>  once for all </s>
<s>  i knew to my sorrow often and often
if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against
peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that
could be </s>
<s>  once for all </s>
<s>  i loved her none the less because i knew it
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly
believed her to be human perfection </s>
<s> 

i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time </s>
<s>  when
i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the
gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet </s>
<s>  i heard the sidedoor open and steps come across the
courtyard </s>
<s>  but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges </s>

being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned </s>
<s>  i started
much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress </s>
<s>  the last man i should have expected to see in that place of
porter at miss havishams door </s>
<s> 

orlick </s>
<s> 

ah young master theres more changes than yours </s>
<s>  but come in come
in </s>
<s>  its opposed to my orders to hold the gate open </s>
<s> 

i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> 
 said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house </s>
<s>  here i am </s>
<s> 

how did you come here </s>

i come her he retorted on my legs </s>
<s>  i had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow </s>
<s> 

are you here for good </s>
<s> 

i aint here for harm young master i suppose </s>
<s> 

i was not so sure of that </s>
<s>  i had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my
legs and arms to my face </s>
<s> 

then you have left the forge </s>
<s>  i said </s>
<s> 

do this look like a forge </s>
<s>  replied orlick sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury </s>
<s>  now do it look like it </s>

i asked him how long he had left gargerys forge </s>

one day is so like another here he replied that i dont know
without casting it up </s>

<s> 

i could have told you that orlick </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said he dryly </s>
<s>  but then youve got to be a scholar </s>
<s> 

by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one
just within the sidedoor with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard </s>
<s>  in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gateporter in paris </s>
<s>  certain keys were hanging on
the wall to which he now added the gate key </s>
<s>  and his patchworkcovered
bed was in a little inner division or recess </s>
<s>  the whole had a slovenly
confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse </s>
<s>  while he
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted upas indeed he was </s>
<s> 

i never saw this room before i remarked </s>
<s>  but there used to be no
porter here </s>
<s> 

no said he </s>
<s>  not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and
tag and rag and bobtail going up and down </s>
<s>  and then i was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and
i took it </s>
<s>  its easier than bellowsing and hammering </s>
<s> thats loaded
that is </s>
<s> 

my eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the
chimneypiece and his eye had followed mine </s>
<s> 

well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to

shaking himself </s>

you meet somebody </s>

i am expected i believe </s>

burn me twice over if i can say </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in
my thick boots and he made his bell sound </s>
<s>  at the end of the passage
while the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me </s>

it is miss pocket </s>

<s>  they
had better be wiser than well </s>
<s>  ah matthew matthew </s>
<s>  you know your way
sir </s>
<s> 

tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time </s>
<s>  i
ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old
way at the door of miss havishams room </s>
<s>  pips rap i heard her say
immediately </s>
<s>  come in pip </s>
<s> 

she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two
hands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on
the fire </s>
<s>  sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been
worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant
lady whom i had never seen </s>
<s> 

come in pip miss havisham continued to mutter without looking round
or up </s>
<s>  come in pip how do you do pip </s>
<s>  so you kiss my hand as if i
were a queen eh </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> 

she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a
grimly playful manner

well </s>
<s> 

i heard miss havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s> 

the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked
archly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estellas eyes </s>
<s>  but she
was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly
in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance
that i seemed to have made none </s>
<s>  i fancied as i looked at her that
i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again </s>
<s>  o
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the
inaccessibility that came about her </s>
<s> 

she gave me her hand </s>
<s>  i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in
seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long
long time </s>
<s> 

do you find her much changed pip </s>
<s>  asked miss havisham with her
greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between
them as a sign to me to sit down there </s>
<s> 

when i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella
in the face or figure </s>
<s>  but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old

what </s>
<s>  you are not going to say into the old estella </s>
<s>  miss havisham
interrupted </s>
<s>  she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away
from her </s>
<s>  dont you remember </s>
<s> 

i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better
then and the like </s>
<s>  estella smiled with perfect composure and said she
had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very
disagreeable </s>
<s> 

is he changed </s>
<s>  miss havisham asked her </s>
<s> 

very much said estella looking at me </s>
<s> 

less coarse and common </s>
<s>  said miss havisham playing with estellas
hair </s>
<s> 

estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again
and looked at me and put the shoe down </s>
<s>  she treated me as a boy still
but she lured me on </s>
<s> 

we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from
france and that she was going to london </s>
<s>  proud and wilful as of old
she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that
it was impossible and out of natureor i thought soto separate them
from her beauty </s>
<s>  truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhoodfrom all those illregulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and joefrom all those visions that had
raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the
anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge and flit away </s>
<s>  in a word it was impossible for me
to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life
of my life </s>
<s> 

it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and
return to the hotel at night and to london tomorrow </s>
<s>  when we had
conversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden </s>
<s>  on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel
her about a little as in times of yore </s>
<s> 

so estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i
had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert </s>
<s> 
i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress </s>
<s>  she
quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine </s>
<s>  as we
drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and said

i must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight
that day </s>
<s>  but i did and i enjoyed it very much </s>
<s> 

you rewarded me very much </s>
<s> 

did i </s>
<s>  she replied in an incidental and forgetful way </s>
<s>  i remember i
entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill
that he should be brought here to pester me with his company </s>
<s> 

he and i are great friends now </s>
<s> 

are you </s>
<s>  i think i recollect though that you read with his father </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish
look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy </s>
<s> 

since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your
companions said estella </s>
<s> 

naturally said i </s>
<s> 

and necessarily she added in a haughty tone </s>
<s>  what was fit company
for you once would be quite unfit company for you now </s>
<s> 

in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering
intention left of going to see joe </s>
<s>  but if i had this observation put
it to flight </s>
<s> 

you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those times </s>
<s>  said
estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting
times </s>
<s> 

not the least </s>
<s> 

the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my
side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at
hers made a contrast that i strongly felt </s>
<s>  it would have rankled in me
more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her and assigned to her </s>
<s> 

the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again
into the brewery yard </s>
<s>  i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her
walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and
careless look in that direction did i </s>
<s>  i reminded her where she had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i
dont remember </s>
<s>  not remember that you made me cry </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  no said
she and shook her head and looked about her </s>
<s>  i verily believe that
her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again
inwardlyand that is the sharpest crying of all </s>
<s> 

you must know said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might that i have no heartif that has anything to
do with my memory </s>
<s> 

i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of
doubting that </s>
<s>  that i knew better </s>
<s>  that there could be no such beauty
without it </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubt said
estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease
to be </s>
<s>  but you know what i mean </s>
<s>  i have no softness there
nosympathysentimentnonsense </s>
<s> 

what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and
looked attentively at me </s>
<s>  anything that i had seen in miss havisham </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different </s>
<s>  and yet i could not trace this to miss havisham </s>
<s>  i looked
again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone </s>
<s> 

what was it </s>
<s> 

i am serious said estella not so much with a frown for her brow was
smooth as with a darkening of her face </s>
<s>  if we are to be thrown much
together you had better believe it at once </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  imperiously stopping
me as i opened my lips </s>
<s>  i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere </s>
<s>  i
have never had any such thing </s>
<s> 

in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she
pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same
first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have
seen me standing scared below </s>
<s>  as my eyes followed her white hand again
the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me </s>
<s>  my
involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm </s>
<s>  instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone </s>
<s> 

what was it </s>
<s> 

what is the matter </s>
<s>  asked estella </s>
<s>  are you scared again </s>
<s> 

i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn
it off </s>
<s> 

then you dont </s>
<s>  very well </s>
<s>  it is said at any rate </s>
<s>  miss havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be
laid aside now with other old belongings </s>
<s>  let us make one more round
of the garden and then go in </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  you shall not shed tears for my
cruelty today </s>
<s>  you shall be my page and give me your shoulder </s>
<s> 

her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground </s>
<s>  she held it in one hand
now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked </s>
<s>  we
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in
bloom for me </s>
<s>  if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance </s>
<s> 

there was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me </s>
<s> 
we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more
in her case than in mine </s>
<s>  but the air of inaccessibility which her
beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight
and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another </s>
<s>  wretched boy </s>
<s> 

at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise
that my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and
would come back to dinner </s>
<s>  the old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me </s>
<s> 

it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast </s>
<s>  but
in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before and i was under stronger enchantment </s>
<s> 

the time so melted away that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand
and estella left us to prepare herself </s>
<s>  we had stopped near the centre
of the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth </s>
<s>  as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful </s>

then estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and
said in a whisper

is she beautiful graceful wellgrown </s>
<s>  do you admire her </s>
<s> 

everybody must who sees her miss havisham </s>
<s> 

she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as
she sat in the chair </s>
<s>  love her love her love her </s>
<s>  how does she use
you </s>
<s> 

before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question
at all she repeated love her love her love her </s>
<s>  if she favors
you love her </s>
<s>  if she wounds you love her </s>
<s>  if she tears your heart to
piecesand as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeperlove
her love her love her </s>
<s> 

never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words </s>
<s>  i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her </s>
<s> 

hear me pip </s>
<s>  i adopted her to be loved </s>
<s>  i bred her and educated her
to be loved </s>
<s>  i developed her into what she is that she might be loved </s>
<s> 
love her </s>
<s> 

she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she
meant to say it </s>
<s>  but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her
lips more like a curse </s>
<s> 

ill tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what
real love is </s>
<s>  it is blind devotion unquestioning selfhumiliation
utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras i
did </s>
<s> 

when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught
her round the waist </s>
<s>  for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a
dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead </s>
<s> 

all this passed in a few seconds </s>
<s>  as i drew her down into her chair i
was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in
the room </s>
<s> 

he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a
pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was
of great value to him in his profession </s>
<s>  i have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief
as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing
as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself that the selfcommittal has followed
directly quite as a matter of course </s>
<s>  when i saw him in the room he had
this expressive pockethandkerchief in both hands and was looking at
us </s>
<s>  on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude indeed </s>
<s>  singular </s>
<s>  and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect </s>
<s> 

miss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody
else afraid of him </s>
<s>  she made a strong attempt to compose herself and
stammered that he was as punctual as ever </s>

as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us </s>
<s>  how do you do
pip </s>
<s>  shall i give you a ride miss havisham </s>
<s>  once round </s>
<s>  and so you are
here pip </s>
<s> 

i told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to
come and see estella </s>
<s>  to which he replied ah </s>
<s>  very fine young lady </s>
<s> 
 then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his
large hands and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets </s>
<s> 

well pip </s>
<s>  how often have you seen miss estella before </s>

ah </s>

<s>  ten thousand times </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  certainly not so many </s>
<s> 

twice </s>
<s> 

jaggers interposed miss havisham much to my relief leave my pip
alone and go with him to your dinner </s>
<s> 

he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together </s>
<s>  while
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat
and drink </s>
<s>  offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred
times and once </s>
<s> 

i considered and said never </s>
<s> 

and never will pip he retorted with a frowning smile </s>
<s>  she has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this
present life of hers </s>
<s>  she wanders about in the night and then lays
hands on such food as she takes </s>
<s> 

pray sir said i may i ask you a question </s>
<s> 

you may said he and i may decline to answer it </s>
<s>  put your question </s>
<s> 

estellas name </s>
<s>  is it havisham or </s>
<s>  i had nothing to add </s>
<s> 

or what </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

is it havisham </s>
<s> 

it is havisham </s>
<s> 

this brought us to the dinnertable where she and sarah pocket awaited
us </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my
green and yellow friend </s>
<s>  we dined very well and were waited on by a
maidservant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but
who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole
time </s>
<s>  after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the
two ladies left us </s>
<s> 

anything to equal the determined reticence of <abvr> jaggers under that
roof i never saw elsewhere even in him </s>
<s>  he kept his very looks to
himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estellas face once during
dinner </s>
<s>  when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered
but never looked at her that i could see </s>
<s>  on the other hand she often
looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his
face never showed the least consciousness </s>
<s>  throughout dinner he took
a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations </s>
<s>  but here
again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he
extortedand even did extort though i dont know howthose references
out of my innocent self </s>
<s> 

and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him
of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that
really was too much for me </s>
<s>  he crossexamined his very wine when he had
nothing else in hand </s>
<s>  he held it between himself and the candle tasted
the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his
glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and
crossexamined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known
the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage </s>
<s>  three or four
times i feebly thought i would start conversation </s>
<s>  but whenever he saw
me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his
hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use for he couldnt answer </s>
<s> 

i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her
in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her
capwhich was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mopand
strewing the ground with her hairwhich assuredly had never grown
on her head </s>
<s>  she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss
havishams room and we four played at whist </s>
<s>  in the interval miss
havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her dressingtable into estellas hair and about her bosom and
arms </s>
<s>  and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick
eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it </s>
<s> 

of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the
glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing </s>
<s>  nor of
the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long
ago </s>
<s>  what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold
presence and my feelings towards estella </s>
<s>  it was not that i knew i could
never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to
hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see
him wash his hands of her </s>
<s>  it was that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of himit was that my feelings should be in the same
place with himthat was the agonizing circumstance </s>
<s> 

we played until nine oclock and then it was arranged that when estella
came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her
at the coach </s>
<s>  and then i took leave of her and touched her and left
her </s>
<s> 

my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine </s>
<s>  far into the
night miss havishams words love her love her love her </s>
<s>  sounded in
my ears </s>

gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the
blacksmiths boy </s>

mute and sleeping now </s>

ah me </s>
<s>  i thought those were high and great emotions </s>

chapter xxx

after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar
in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlicks
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havishams </s>
<s> 
why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man </s>
<s>  it seemed
quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a
satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick </s>
<s>  very
good pip he observed when i had concluded ill go round presently
and pay our friend off </s>
<s>  rather alarmed by this summary action i was
for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with </s>
<s>  oh no he wont said my guardian making his
pockethandkerchiefpoint with perfect confidence </s>
<s>  i should like to
see him argue the question with me </s>
<s> 

as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i
breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold
my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and
that i would go on along the london road while <abvr> jaggers was occupied
if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when
overtaken </s>
<s>  i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately
after breakfast </s>
<s>  by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of pumblechooks premises i got round into
the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in
comparative security </s>
<s> 

it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after </s>
<s> 
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they
had forgotten something and pass me face to faceon which occasions i
dont know whether they or i made the worse pretence </s>
<s>  they of not doing
it or i of not seeing it </s>
<s>  still my position was a distinguished one
and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant trabbs boy </s>
<s> 

casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i
beheld trabbs boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag </s>
<s> 
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced
with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating
myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabbs boy smote
together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in
every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace
hold me </s>
<s>  im so frightened </s>
<s>  feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance </s>
<s>  as i passed him
his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme
humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust </s>
<s> 

this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing </s>
<s>  i had not advanced
another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement
and indignation i again beheld trabbs boy approaching </s>
<s>  he was coming
round a narrow corner </s>
<s>  his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest
industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabbs with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait </s>
<s>  with a shock he became
aware of me and was severely visited as before </s>
<s>  but this time his
motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy </s>
<s>  his
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators
and i felt utterly confounded </s>
<s> 

i had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice when i
again beheld trabbs boy shooting round by a back way </s>
<s>  this time he was
entirely changed </s>
<s>  he wore the blue bag in the manner of my greatcoat
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he
from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand dont know yah </s>
<s> 
 words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by trabbs boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his
shirtcollar twined his sidehair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked
extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his
attendants dont know yah dont know yah ˜pon my soul dont know
yah </s>
<s>  the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith
culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to
speak ejected by it into the open country </s>
<s> 

but unless i had taken the life of trabbs boy on that occasion i
really do not even now see what i could have done save endure </s>
<s>  to
have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his hearts best blood would have been
futile and degrading </s>
<s>  moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt </s>
<s>  an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew
out again between his captors legs scornfully yelping </s>
<s>  i wrote
however to <abvr> trabb by next days post to say that <abvr> pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to
the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing
in every respectable mind </s>
<s> 

the coach with <abvr> jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my
boxseat again and arrived in london safebut not sound for my heart
was gone </s>
<s>  as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then
went on to barnards inn </s>
<s> 

i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back </s>
<s> 
having despatched the avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to the
dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum </s>
<s>  as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the
hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole i sent him to the play </s>
<s>  a better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than
the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him
employment </s>
<s>  so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park
corner to see what oclock it was </s>
<s> 

dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to
herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell
you </s>
<s> 

my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your
confidence </s>
<s> 

it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person </s>
<s> 

herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side
and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i
didnt go on </s>
<s> 

herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i lovei
adoreestella </s>
<s> 

instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matterofcourse
way exactly </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 

well herbert </s>
<s>  is that all you say </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 

what next i mean </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  of course i know that </s>
<s> 

how do you know it </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

how do i know it handel </s>
<s>  why from you </s>
<s> 

i never told you </s>
<s> 

told me </s>
<s>  you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i
have had senses to perceive it </s>
<s>  you have always adored her ever since
i have known you </s>
<s>  you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together </s>
<s>  told me </s>
<s>  why you have always told me all day long </s>
<s>  when you
told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her
the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed </s>
<s> 

very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light i have never left off adoring her </s>
<s>  and she has come back a most
beautiful and most elegant creature </s>
<s>  and i saw her yesterday </s>
<s>  and if i
adored her before i now doubly adore her </s>
<s> 

lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for
her and allotted to her </s>
<s>  without encroaching on forbidden ground we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact </s>
<s>  have you any idea yet of estellas views on the adoration
question </s>
<s> 

i shook my head gloomily </s>
<s>  oh </s>
<s>  she is thousands of miles away from me
 said i </s>
<s> 

patience my dear handel </s>
<s>  time enough time enough </s>
<s>  but you have
something more to say </s>
<s> 

i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet its no worse to say it
than to think it </s>
<s>  you call me a lucky fellow </s>
<s>  of course i am </s>
<s>  i was a
blacksmiths boy but yesterday </s>
<s>  i amwhat shall i say i amtoday </s>
<s> 

say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling
and clapping his hand on the back of minea good fellow with
impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and
dreaming curiously mixed in him </s>
<s> 

i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character </s>
<s>  on the whole i by no means recognized the analysis
but thought it not worth disputing </s>
<s> 

when i ask what i am to call myself today herbert i went on i
suggest what i have in my thoughts </s>
<s>  you say i am lucky </s>
<s>  i know i have
done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised
me </s>
<s>  that is being very lucky </s>
<s>  and yet when i think of estella

and when dont you you know </s>
<s>  herbert threw in with his eyes on the
fire </s>
<s>  which i thought kind and sympathetic of him </s>
<s> 

then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances </s>
<s>  avoiding forbidden
ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of
one person naming no person all my expectations depend </s>
<s>  and at the
best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what
they are </s>
<s>  in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been
there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday </s>
<s> 

now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our
gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass </s>
<s>  likewise it seems to me
that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal </s>
<s>  didnt you tell me that
your guardian <abvr> jaggers told you in the beginning that you were
not endowed with expectations only </s>
<s>  and even if he had not told you
sothough that is a very large if i grantcould you believe that of
all men in london <abvr> jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
towards you unless he were sure of his ground </s>
<s> 

i said i could not deny that this was a strong point </s>
<s>  i said it people
often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice </s>
<s> as if i wanted to deny it </s>
<s> 

i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger </s>
<s>  as to the rest you
must bide your guardians time and he must bide his clients time </s>
<s> 
youll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are and then perhaps
youll get some further enlightenment </s>
<s>  at all events youll be nearer
getting it for it must come at last </s>
<s> 

what a hopeful disposition you have </s>
<s>  said i gratefully admiring his
cheery ways </s>
<s> 

i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else </s>
<s>  i must
acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is
not my own but my fathers </s>
<s>  the only remark i ever heard him make on
your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or <abvr>
jaggers would not be in it </s>
<s>  and now before i say anything more about my
father or my fathers son and repay confidence with confidence i want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a momentpositively
repulsive </s>
<s> 

you wont succeed said i </s>
<s> 

o yes i shall </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  one two three and now i am in for it </s>
<s> 
handel my good fellow </s>
<s> though he spoke in this light tone he was
very much in earnesti have been thinking since we have been talking
with our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition
of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian </s>
<s>  am
i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never
referred to her directly or indirectly in any way </s>
<s>  never even hinted
for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage
ultimately </s>
<s> 

never </s>
<s> 

now handel i am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes upon my
soul and honor </s>
<s>  not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from
her </s>
<s> i told you i should be disagreeable </s>
<s> 

i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh
winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued
me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly
rising and when i laid my hand upon the village fingerpost smote upon
my heart again </s>
<s>  there was silence between us for a little while </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but my dear handel herbert went on as if we had been talking
instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very
serious </s>
<s>  think of her bringingup and think of miss havisham </s>
<s>  think of
what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me </s>
<s>  this may
lead to miserable things </s>
<s> 

i know it herbert said i with my head still turned away but i
cant help it </s>
<s> 

you cant detach yourself </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  impossible </s>
<s> 

you cant try handel </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  impossible </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had
been asleep and stirring the fire now ill endeavor to make myself
agreeable again </s>
<s> 

so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs
in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about
looked into the hall peeped into the letterbox shut the door and
came back to his chair by the fire </s>
<s>  where he sat down nursing his left
leg in both arms </s>
<s> 

i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my
fathers son </s>
<s>  i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my fathers son
to remark that my fathers establishment is not particularly brilliant
in its housekeeping </s>
<s> 

there is always plenty herbert said i to say something encouraging </s>
<s> 

o yes </s>
<s>  and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval
and so does the marinestore shop in the back street </s>
<s>  gravely handel
for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do </s>
<s>  i
suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up </s>
<s> 
but if ever there was the time is gone </s>
<s>  may i ask you if you have ever
had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country
that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most
particularly anxious to be married </s>
<s> 

this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it
so </s>
<s> 

i dont know said herbert thats what i want to know </s>
<s>  because it
is decidedly the case with us </s>
<s>  my poor sister charlotte who was next me
and died before she was fourteen was a striking example </s>
<s>  little jane
is the same </s>
<s>  in her desire to be matrimonially established you
might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual
contemplation of domestic bliss </s>
<s>  little alick in a frock has already
made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew </s>
<s>  and
indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby </s>
<s> 

then you are </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

i am said herbert </s>
<s>  but its a secret </s>
<s> 

i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favored with
further particulars </s>
<s>  he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength </s>
<s> 

may i ask the name </s>
<s>  i said </s>
<s> 

name of clara said herbert </s>
<s> 

live in london </s>
<s> 

yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting
theme that she is rather below my mothers nonsensical family notions </s>
<s> 
her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships </s>
<s>  i think he
was a species of purser </s>
<s> 

what is he now </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

hes an invalid now replied herbert </s>
<s> 

living on </s>
<s> 

on the first floor said herbert </s>
<s>  which was not at all what i meant
for i had intended my question to apply to his means </s>
<s>  i have never seen
him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara </s>
<s> 
but i have heard him constantly </s>
<s>  he makes tremendous rowsroars and
pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument </s>
<s>  in looking at me and
then laughing heartily herbert for the time recovered his usual lively
manner </s>
<s> 

dont you expect to see him </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

o yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert because
i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the
ceiling </s>
<s>  but i dont know how long the rafters may hold </s>
<s> 

when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told
me that the moment he began to realize capital it was his intention
to marry this young lady </s>
<s>  he added as a selfevident proposition
engendering low spirits but you cant marry you know while youre
looking about you </s>
<s> 

as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to
realize this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my pockets </s>
<s> 
a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened
it and found it to be the playbill i had received from joe relative
to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown </s>
<s>  and bless my
heart i involuntarily added aloud its tonight </s>
<s> 

this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play </s>
<s>  so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet
herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable
means and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me
by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had
warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles
made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of <abvr>
wopsle and denmark </s>

boy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life
and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance </s>
<s>  my gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished
that his curls and forehead had been more probable </s>
<s> 

several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded </s>
<s> 
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him
to the tomb and to have brought it back </s>
<s>  the royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality </s>
<s>  it was this i conceive which led to the shades being
advised by the gallery to turn over </s>
<s> a recommendation which it took
extremely ill </s>
<s>  it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall </s>
<s>  this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively </s>
<s> 
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically
brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her </s>
<s> 
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as
if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another
and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned
as the kettledrum </s>
<s>  the noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able
seaman a strolling actor a gravedigger a clergyman and a person
of the utmost importance at a court fencingmatch on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged </s>
<s>  this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and evenon
his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral
serviceto the general indignation taking the form of nuts </s>
<s>  lastly
ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of
time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried
it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the babys put
to bed lets have supper </s>
<s>  which to say the least of it was out of
keeping </s>
<s> 

upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect </s>
<s>  whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt the public helped him out with it </s>
<s>  as for example </s>
<s>  on the
question whether ˜twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes
and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for
it </s>
<s>  and quite a debating society arose </s>
<s>  when he asked what should such
fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged
with loud cries of hear hear </s>
<s>  when he appeared with his stocking
disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat
fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his
leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him </s>
<s> 
on his taking the recordersvery like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the doorhe was
called upon unanimously for rule britannia </s>
<s>  when he recommended the
player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and dont you do
it neither </s>
<s>  youre a deal worse than him </s>
<s>  and i grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted <abvr> wopsle on every one of these occasions </s>
<s> 

but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance
of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical washhouse
on one side and a turnpike gate on the other </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out </s>
<s>  heres the
undertaker a coming to see how youre a getting on with your work </s>
<s> 
 i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that <abvr> wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it
without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast </s>
<s> 
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment waiter </s>
<s>  the arrival of the body for interment in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general
joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of
an individual obnoxious to identification </s>
<s>  the joy attended <abvr> wopsle
through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchentable and had died by inches from the ankles upward </s>
<s> 

we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud <abvr> wopsle </s>
<s> 
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in </s>
<s>  therefore we had sat
feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear </s>
<s>  i
laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll </s>
<s> 
and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in <abvr> wopsles elocutionnot for old associations sake i am
afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and
downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything </s>
<s> 
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said
to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him </s>
<s> 

we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough
either </s>
<s>  standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we
came up with him

<s>  yes </s>
<s>  shall we follow you </s>
<s> 

a few steps please </s>
<s>  when we were in a side alley he turned and
asked how did you think he looked </s>
<s> i dressed him </s>
<s> 

i dont know what he had looked like except a funeral </s>
<s>  with the
addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary fire office </s>
<s>  but i said he had looked very nice </s>
<s> 

when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak
beautiful </s>
<s>  but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he
see the ghost in the queens apartment he might have made more of his
stockings </s>
<s> 

i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door
into a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it </s>
<s>  here <abvr> wopsle
was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just
room for us to look at him over one anothers shoulders by keeping the
packingcase door or lid wide open </s>
<s> 

gentlemen said <abvr> wopsle i am proud to see you </s>
<s>  i hope <abvr> pip
you will excuse my sending round </s>
<s>  i had the happiness to know you in
former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged on the noble and the affluent </s>
<s> 

meanwhile <abvr> waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to
get himself out of his princely sables </s>
<s> 

skin the stockings off <abvr> waldengarver said the owner of that
property or youll bust ˜em </s>
<s>  bust ˜em and youll bust fiveandthirty
shillings </s>
<s>  shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair </s>
<s>  keep

<s> 

with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim </s>
<s>  who on
the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward
with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow </s>
<s> 

i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play </s>
<s>  but then <abvr>
waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said

gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front </s>
<s> 

herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally </s>
<s>  so i
said capitally </s>
<s> 

how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen </s>
<s>  said <abvr>
waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage </s>
<s> 

herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete </s>
<s>  so i
said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it
massive and concrete </s>
<s> 

i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said <abvr> waldengarver
with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at
the time and holding on by the seat of the chair </s>

but ill tell you one thing <abvr> waldengarver said the man who was on
his knees in which youre out in your reading </s>
<s>  now mind </s>

who says contrairy </s>
<s>  i tell you so </s>
<s>  youre out in your reading of hamlet
when you get your legs in profile </s>
<s>  the last hamlet as i dressed made
the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a
large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which
was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever
his reading brought him into profile i called out i dont see no
wafers </s>
<s>  and at night his reading was lovely </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful
dependenti overlook his folly </s>
<s>  and then said aloud my view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here </s>
<s>  but they will improve they
will improve </s>
<s> 

herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve </s>
<s> 

did you observe gentlemen said <abvr> waldengarver that there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the servicei

we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man </s>
<s>  i
added he was drunk no doubt </s>

o dear no sir said <abvr> wopsle not drunk </s>

<s>  such is the profession </s>
<s> 

without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for <abvr>
wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was
that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces
put onwhich jostled us out at the doorwayto ask herbert what he
thought of having him home to supper </s>
<s>  herbert said he thought it would
be kind to do so </s>
<s>  therefore i invited him and he went to barnards
with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat
until two oclock in the morning reviewing his success and developing
his plans </s>
<s>  i forget in detail what they were but i have a general
recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end
with crushing it </s>
<s>  inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope </s>
<s> 

miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i
had to give my hand in marriage to herberts clara or play hamlet to
miss havishams ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing
twenty words of it </s>

chapter xxxii

one day when i was busy with my books and <abvr> pocket i received a note
by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter </s>
<s> 
for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed
i divined whose hand it was </s>
<s>  it had no set beginning as dear <abvr> pip
or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus </s>
<s> 

i am to come to london the day after tomorrow by the midday coach </s>
<s>  i
believe it was settled you should meet me </s>
<s>  at all events miss havisham
has that impression and i write in obedience to it </s>
<s>  she sends you her
regard </s>
<s> 

yours estella </s>
<s> 

if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion </s>
<s>  but as there was not i was fain to be
content with those i had </s>
<s>  my appetite vanished instantly and i knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived </s>
<s>  not that its arrival brought
me either </s>
<s>  for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the
coachoffice in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the
blue boar in our town </s>
<s>  for all that i knew this perfectly well i still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time </s>
<s>  and in this condition of unreason i
had performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours when
wemmick ran against me </s>
<s> 

halloa <abvr> pip said he </s>
<s>  how do you do </s>
<s>  i should hardly have thought
this was your beat </s>
<s> 

i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged </s>
<s> 

both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged </s>
<s> 
hes in wonderful feather </s>
<s>  hell be eightytwo next birthday </s>
<s>  i have
a notion of firing eightytwo times if the neighborhood shouldnt
complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure </s>
<s> 
however this is not london talk </s>
<s>  where do you think i am going to </s>
<s> 

to the office </s>
<s>  said i for he was tending in that direction </s>
<s> 

next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate </s>
<s>  we are in
a bankersparcel case just at present and i have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client </s>
<s> 

did your client commit the robbery </s>
<s>  i asked </s>
<s> 

bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily </s>
<s>  but he
is accused of it </s>
<s>  so might you or i be </s>
<s>  either of us might be accused of
it you know </s>
<s> 

only neither of us is i remarked </s>
<s> 

yah </s>
<s>  said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger </s>
<s> 
youre a deep one <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  would you like to have a look at newgate </s>
<s> 
have you time to spare </s>
<s> 

i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coachoffice </s>
<s>  muttering that i would make the inquiry whether
i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his
temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expectedwhich
i knew beforehand quite as well as he </s>
<s>  i then rejoined <abvr> wemmick and
affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i
had received accepted his offer </s>
<s> 

we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules into the interior of the jail </s>
<s>  at that time jails were much
neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoingand which is always its heaviest and longest
punishmentwas still far off </s>
<s>  so felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup </s>
<s> 
it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his
rounds with beer </s>
<s>  and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying
beer and talking to friends </s>
<s>  and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing
scene it was </s>
<s> 

it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his plants </s>
<s>  this was first put into my head by his
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain
tom </s>
<s>  are you there </s>
<s>  ah indeed </s>
<s>  and also is that black bill behind
the cistern </s>
<s>  why i didnt look for you these two months </s>
<s>  how do you find
yourself </s>
<s>  equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperersalways singlywemmick with his postoffice in
an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last
observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial </s>
<s> 

he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department
of <abvr> jaggerss business </s>
<s>  though something of the state of <abvr> jaggers
hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits </s>
<s>  his
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod
and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both
hands and then tightening the postoffice and putting his hands in his
pockets </s>
<s>  in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees and then <abvr> wemmick backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced said its no use my boy </s>
<s>  im only
a subordinate </s>
<s>  i cant take it </s>
<s>  dont go on in that way with a
subordinate </s>
<s>  if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had
better address yourself to a principal </s>
<s>  there are plenty of principals
in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may
be worth the while of another </s>
<s>  thats my recommendation to you speaking
as a subordinate </s>
<s>  dont try on useless measures </s>
<s>  why should you </s>
<s>  now
whos next </s>
<s> 

thus we walked through wemmicks greenhouse until he turned to me and
said notice the man i shall shake hands with </s>
<s>  i should have done so
without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet </s>
<s> 

almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can
see now as i write in a wellworn olivecolored frockcoat with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that
went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner
of the bars and put his hand to his hatwhich had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold brothwith a halfserious and halfjocose military
salute </s>
<s> 

colonel to you </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  how are you colonel </s>
<s> 

all right <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong
for us colonel </s>
<s> 

yes it was too strong sirbut i dont care </s>
<s> 

no no said wemmick coolly you dont care </s>
<s>  then turning to me
served his majesty this man </s>
<s>  was a soldier in the line and bought his
discharge </s>
<s> 

i said indeed </s>
<s>  and the mans eyes looked at me and then looked over
my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across
his lips and laughed </s>
<s> 

i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to wemmick </s>
<s> 

perhaps returned my friend but theres no knowing </s>
<s> 

i am glad to have the chance of bidding you goodbye <abvr> wemmick said
the man stretching out his hand between two bars </s>
<s> 

thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him </s>
<s>  same to you colonel </s>
<s> 

if what i had upon me when taken had been real <abvr> wemmick said the
man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ringin acknowledgment of your attentions </s>
<s> 

ill accept the will for the deed said wemmick </s>
<s>  by the by </s>
<s>  you were
quite a pigeonfancier </s>
<s>  the man looked up at the sky </s>
<s>  i am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers </s>
<s>  could you commission any friend of
yours to bring me a pair if youve no further use for ˜em </s>
<s> 

it shall be done sir </s>
<s> 

all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of </s>
<s>  good afternoon
colonel </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s>  they shook hands again and as we walked away wemmick
said to me a coiner a very good workman </s>
<s>  the recorders report is
made today and he is sure to be executed on monday </s>
<s>  still you see as
far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same </s>
<s> 
 with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast
his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering
what other pot would go best in its place </s>
<s> 

as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less
than by those whom they held in charge </s>
<s>  well <abvr> wemmick said the
turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates
and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other whats <abvr>
jaggers going to do with that waterside murder </s>

manslaughter or whats he going to make of it </s>
<s> 

why dont you ask him </s>
<s>  returned wemmick </s>
<s> 

o yes i dare say </s>
<s>  said the turnkey </s>
<s> 

now thats the way with them here <abvr> pip remarked wemmick turning
to me with his postoffice elongated </s>
<s>  they dont mind what they ask of
me the subordinate </s>
<s>  but youll never catch ˜em asking any questions of
my principal </s>
<s> 

is this young gentleman one of the ˜prentices or articled ones of your
office </s>
<s>  asked the turnkey with a grin at <abvr> wemmicks humor </s>
<s> 

there he goes again you see </s>
<s>  cried wemmick i told you so </s>
<s>  asks
another question of the subordinate before his first is dry </s>
<s>  well
supposing <abvr> pip is one of them </s>
<s> 

why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what <abvr> jaggers
is </s>
<s> 

yah </s>
<s>  cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious
way youre dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my
principal you know you are </s>
<s>  let us out you old fox or ill get him to
bring an action against you for false imprisonment </s>
<s> 

the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street </s>
<s> 

mind you <abvr> pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm
to be more confidential </s>
<s>  i dont know that <abvr> jaggers does a better
thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high </s>
<s>  hes always so
high </s>
<s>  his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities </s>
<s>  that
colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him
his intentions respecting a case </s>
<s>  then between his height and them he
slips in his subordinatedont you see </s>
<s> and so he has ˜em soul and
body </s>
<s> 

i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardians
subtlety </s>
<s>  to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the
first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where
suppliants for <abvr> jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual and i
returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice with some three
hours on hand </s>
<s>  i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it
was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime </s>
<s> 
that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i
should have first encountered it </s>
<s>  that it should have reappeared on two
occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone </s>
<s>  that
it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement </s>
<s>  while my
mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud
and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence
of the contrast between the jail and her </s>
<s>  i wished that wemmick had not
met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that
of all days in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in
my breath and on my clothes </s>
<s>  i beat the prison dust off my feet as i
sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled
its air from my lungs </s>
<s>  so contaminated did i feel remembering who was
coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free
from the soiling consciousness of <abvr> wemmicks conservatory when i saw
her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me </s>
<s> 

what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed </s>
<s> 




chapter xxxiii

in her furred travellingdress estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes </s>
<s>  her manner was more
winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i
saw miss havishams influence in the change </s>
<s> 

we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and
when it was all collected i rememberedhaving forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhilethat i knew nothing of her destination </s>
<s> 

i am going to richmond she told me </s>
<s>  our lesson is that there are
two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the

<s>  this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out
of it </s>
<s>  o you must take the purse </s>
<s>  we have no choice you and i but to
obey our instructions </s>
<s>  we are not free to follow our own devices you

<s> 

as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words </s>
<s>  she said them slightingly but not with
displeasure </s>
<s> 

a carriage will have to be sent for estella </s>
<s>  will you rest here a
little </s>
<s> 

yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you
are to take care of me the while </s>
<s> 

she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his life to show us a private sittingroom </s>
<s>  upon that
he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clew without which he
couldnt find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the
establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous
article considering the holes proportions an anchovy saucecruet
and somebodys pattens </s>
<s>  on my objecting to this retreat he took us into
another room with a dinnertable for thirty and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust </s>
<s>  having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order </s>
<s>  which
proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room
in a very low state of mind </s>
<s> 

i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong
combination of stable with soupstock might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department </s>
<s> 
yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it </s>
<s>  i thought that
with her i could have been happy there for life </s>
<s>  i was not at all happy

i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration </s>

<s> 

you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said
estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage </s>
<s>  they watch you misrepresent you
write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives </s>
<s>  you can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you </s>

they do me no harm i hope </s>
<s> 

instead of answering estella burst out laughing </s>
<s>  this was very singular
to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity </s>
<s>  when she left
offand she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoymenti said
in my diffident way with her

i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm </s>
<s> 

no no you may be sure of that said estella </s>
<s>  you may be certain that
i laugh because they fail </s>
<s>  o those people with miss havisham and the
tortures they undergo </s>
<s>  she laughed again and even now when she had
told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not
doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion </s>
<s> 
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew </s>
<s>  she saw
the thought in my mind and answered it </s>
<s> 

it is not easy for even you </s>
<s>  said estella to know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous </s>
<s>  for you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby </s>

<s>  you did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
in the night </s>

<s> 

it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place </s>
<s>  i would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap </s>
<s> 

two things i can tell you said estella </s>
<s>  first notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set
your mind at rest that these people never willnever would in hundred
yearsimpair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great
or small </s>
<s>  second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it </s>
<s> 

as she gave it to me playfullyfor her darker mood had been but
momentaryi held it and put it to my lips </s>
<s>  you ridiculous boy said
estella will you never take warning </s>
<s>  or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek </s>
<s> 

what spirit was that </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

i must think a moment </s>
<s>  a spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters </s>
<s> 

if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again </s>
<s> 

you should have asked before you touched the hand </s>
<s>  but yes if you
like </s>
<s> 

i leaned down and her calm face was like a statues </s>
<s>  now said
estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take
care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond </s>
<s> 

her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us and we were mere puppets gave me pain </s>
<s>  but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain </s>
<s>  whatever her tone with me happened to be
i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it </s>
<s>  and yet i went on
against trust and against hope </s>
<s>  why repeat it a thousand times </s>
<s>  so it
always was </s>
<s> 

i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clew

tea not a glimpse </s>

forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover

expressing in his countenance burden and suffering </s>

absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs </s>

water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i

the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten

house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estellas purse

<s>  turning into
cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls

what place is that </s>

i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it and then
told her </s>
<s>  as she looked at it and drew in her head again
murmuring wretches </s>
<s>  i would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else
has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in london </s>
<s> 

he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a
low voice </s>
<s> 

you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose </s>
<s> 

i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since
i can remember </s>
<s>  but i know him no better now than i did before i could
speak plainly </s>
<s>  what is your own experience of him </s>
<s>  do you advance with
him </s>
<s> 

once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very
well </s>
<s> 

are you intimate </s>
<s> 

i have dined with him at his private house </s>
<s> 

i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place </s>
<s> 

it is a curious place </s>
<s> 

i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her </s>
<s>  but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas </s>
<s>  it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling i had had before </s>
<s>  and when we were out of
it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning </s>
<s> 

so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this
side of it and what on that </s>
<s>  the great city was almost new to her she
told me for she had never left miss havishams neighborhood until she
had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in
going and returning </s>
<s>  i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
while she remained here </s>
<s>  to that she emphatically said god forbid </s>
<s>  and
no more </s>
<s> 

it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me </s>
<s> 
that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains </s>
<s>  yet this made me none the happier for even if she had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have
felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do
it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush
it and throw it away </s>
<s> 

when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where <abvr> matthew
pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i
hoped i should see her sometimes </s>
<s> 

o yes you are to see me </s>
<s>  you are to come when you think proper </s>
<s>  you
are to be mentioned to the family </s>
<s>  indeed you are already mentioned </s>
<s> 

i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  there are only two </s>
<s>  mother and daughter </s>
<s>  the mother is a lady of
some station though not averse to increasing her income </s>
<s> 

i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon </s>
<s> 

it is a part of miss havishams plans for me pip said estella with
a sigh as if she were tired </s>
<s>  i am to write to her constantly and see
her regularly and report how i go oni and the jewelsfor they are
nearly all mine now </s>
<s> 

it was the first time she had ever called me by my name </s>
<s>  of course she
did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up </s>
<s> 

we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house
by the greena staid old house where hoops and powder and patches
embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their
court days many a time </s>
<s>  some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts </s>
<s>  but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest </s>
<s> 

a bell with an old voicewhich i dare say in its time had often said
to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamondhilted
sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded
gravely in the moonlight and two cherrycolored maids came fluttering
out to receive estella </s>
<s>  the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she
gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed
likewise </s>
<s>  and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i
should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy
with her but always miserable </s>
<s> 

i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in
with a bad heartache and i got out with a worse heartache </s>
<s>  at our
own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her little lover </s>
<s>  and i envied her little lover in spite of
his being subject to flopson </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket was out lecturing </s>
<s>  for he was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes </s>
<s>  but
mrs </s>
<s>  pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of
the babys having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet
during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards
of millers </s>
<s>  and more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heartache of begging him
to accept my confidence </s>

sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby i thoughtwellno i wouldnt </s>

chapter xxxiv

as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me </s>
<s>  their influence on
my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible
but i knew very well that it was not all good </s>
<s>  i lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to joe </s>
<s>  my conscience was not
by any means comfortable about biddy </s>
<s>  when i woke up in the nightlike
camillai used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should
have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havishams face
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest
old forge </s>
<s>  many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the
fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home </s>
<s> 

yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production </s>
<s>  that is to say supposing i had had no expectations
and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my
satisfaction that i should have done much better </s>
<s>  now concerning the
influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so
i perceivedthough dimly enough perhapsthat it was not beneficial
to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert </s>
<s> 
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace
with anxieties and regrets </s>
<s>  i was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor
arts they practised </s>
<s>  because such littlenesses were their natural
bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them
slumbering </s>
<s>  but herberts was a very different case and it often caused
me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing
the canarybreasted avenger at his disposal </s>
<s> 

so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began
to contract a quantity of debt </s>
<s>  i could hardly begin but herbert
must begin too so he soon followed </s>
<s>  at startops suggestion we put
ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove </s>
<s> 
the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs </s>
<s>  i know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society </s>
<s>  which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove </s>
<s> 

the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was
in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honor of
joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners </s>
<s>  occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage
headforemost over the apron </s>
<s>  and i saw him on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional waylike coals </s>
<s> 
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be
according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age </s>
<s> 

in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken
herberts expenses on myself </s>
<s>  but herbert was proud and i could make
no such proposal to him </s>
<s>  so he got into difficulties in every direction
and continued to look about him </s>
<s>  when we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a
desponding eye at breakfasttime </s>
<s>  that he began to look about him more
hopefully about midday </s>
<s>  that he drooped when he came into dinner </s>
<s> 
that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after
dinner </s>
<s>  that he all but realized capital towards midnight </s>
<s>  and that at
about two oclock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune </s>
<s> 

i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at
hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by </s>
<s>  herbert
would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet </s>
<s>  but in the general
tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was
a thing to transact itself somehow </s>
<s>  in the meantime <abvr> pocket grew
grayer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the
hair </s>
<s>  while <abvr> pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read
her book of dignities lost her pockethandkerchief told us about her
grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her notice </s>
<s> 

as i am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at barnards inn </s>
<s> 

we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us </s>
<s>  we were always more or less
miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition </s>
<s> 
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did </s>
<s>  to the best of my
belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one </s>
<s> 

every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look
about him </s>
<s>  i often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which
he consorted with an inkjar a hatpeg a coalbox a stringbox an
almanac a desk and stool and a ruler </s>
<s>  and i do not remember that i
ever saw him do anything else but look about him </s>
<s>  if we all did what
we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a
republic of the virtues </s>
<s>  he had nothing else to do poor fellow except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloydsin observance
of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think </s>
<s>  he never did anything
else in connection with lloyds that i could find out except come back
again </s>
<s>  when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively
must find an opening he would go on ˜change at a busy time and walk in
and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled
magnates </s>
<s>  for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an
opening wont come to one but one must go to itso i have been </s>
<s> 

if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning </s>
<s>  i detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the
sight of the avengers livery </s>
<s>  which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
fourandtwenty hours </s>
<s>  as we got more and more into debt breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at
breakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings not
unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery
 i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake
him off his feetso that he was actually in the air like a booted
cupidfor presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll </s>
<s> 

at certain timesmeaning at uncertain times for they depended on our
humori would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery

my dear herbert we are getting on badly </s>
<s> 

my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will
believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence </s>
<s> 

then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs </s>
<s> 

we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose </s>
<s>  i always thought this was business this was the way to
confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat </s>
<s>  and
i know herbert thought so too </s>
<s> 

we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark </s>
<s> 
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper </s>
<s>  for there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery </s>
<s> 

i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a
neat hand the heading memorandum of pips debts </s>
<s>  with barnards inn
and the date very carefully added </s>
<s>  herbert would also take a sheet of
paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of
herberts debts </s>
<s> 

each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side
which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half
burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the lookingglass and
otherwise damaged </s>
<s>  the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly
insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money </s>
<s>  in point of
meritorious character the two things seemed about equal </s>
<s> 

when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on </s>
<s> 
herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his accumulating figures </s>
<s> 

they are mounting up handel herbert would say </s>
<s>  upon my life they
are mounting up </s>
<s> 

be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great
assiduity </s>
<s>  look the thing in the face </s>
<s>  look into your affairs </s>
<s>  stare
them out of countenance </s>
<s> 

so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance </s>
<s> 

however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would
fall to work again </s>
<s>  after a time he would give up once more on the plea
that he had not got cobbss bill or lobbss or nobbss as the case
might be </s>
<s> 

then herbert estimate </s>
<s>  estimate it in round numbers and put it
down </s>
<s> 

what a fellow of resource you are </s>
<s>  my friend would reply with
admiration </s>
<s>  really your business powers are very remarkable </s>
<s> 

i thought so too </s>
<s>  i established with myself on these occasions
the reputation of a firstrate man of businessprompt decisive
energetic clear coolheaded </s>
<s>  when i had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off </s>
<s>  my
selfapproval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation </s>
<s> 
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly
docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle </s>
<s>  then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my
administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a
focus for him </s>
<s> 

my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving
a margin </s>
<s>  for example </s>
<s>  supposing herberts debts to be one hundred and
sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence i would say leave a margin and
put them down at two hundred </s>
<s>  or supposing my own to be four times as
much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred </s>
<s>  i had
the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound
to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive
device </s>
<s>  for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent
of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it
imparted got pretty far on into another margin </s>
<s> 

but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable
opinion of myself </s>
<s>  soothed by my exertions my method and herberts
compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the
table before me among the stationary and feel like a bank of some sort
rather than a private individual </s>
<s> 

we shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might
not be interrupted </s>
<s>  i had fallen into my serene state one evening when
we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on
the ground </s>
<s>  its for you handel said herbert going out and coming
back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter </s>
<s>  this was in
allusion to its heavy black seal and border </s>
<s> 

the letter was signed trabb & co </s>
<s>  and its contents were simply that
i was an honored sir and that they begged to inform me that <abvr> j </s>
<s> 
gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six
in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on
monday next at three oclock in the afternoon </s>

chapter xxxv

it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful </s>
<s>  the figure of my
sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day </s>
<s>  that
the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed
unable to compass </s>
<s>  and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door </s>
<s> 
in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were
still alive and had been often there </s>
<s> 

whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness </s>
<s>  but i suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness </s>
<s>  under its influence and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered
so much </s>
<s>  and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully
pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity </s>
<s> 

having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him
that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind i have glanced at </s>
<s>  i went down early in the
morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the
forge </s>

vividly returned </s>
<s>  but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of tickler </s>
<s>  for now the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me </s>
<s> 

at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co </s>
<s>  had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession </s>
<s>  two dismally absurd
persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandageas if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybodywere posted at the front door </s>
<s>  and in one of them i
recognized a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck
with both arms </s>
<s>  all the children of the village and most of the women
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge </s>
<s>  and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy
knocked at the doorimplying that i was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself </s>
<s> 

another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a
wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlor </s>
<s>  here <abvr>
trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves
up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity
of black pins </s>
<s>  at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting
somebodys hat into black longclothes like an african baby </s>
<s>  so he held
out his hand for mine </s>
<s>  but i misled by the action and confused by the
occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection </s>
<s> 

poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room </s>
<s>  where

down and said to him dear joe how are you </s>

about for the table of refreshments </s>

had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cutup plum cake upon
it and there were cutup oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two
decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used

<s>  one full of port and one of sherry </s>
<s>  standing at this
table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak

<s>  cried <abvr> trabb at this point in a
depressed businesslike voice </s>
<s>  pockethandkerchiefs out </s>
<s>  we are ready </s>
<s> 

so we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces as if our
noses were bleeding and filed out two and two </s>
<s>  joe and i </s>
<s>  biddy and
pumblechook </s>
<s>  <abvr> and <abvr> hubble </s>
<s>  the remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along
under the guidance of two keepersthe postboy and his comrade </s>
<s> 

the neighborhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we
were much admired as we went through the village </s>
<s>  the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage </s>
<s>  at such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come </s>
<s>  here they
are </s>
<s>  and we were all but cheered </s>
<s>  in this progress i was much annoyed
by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing
my cloak </s>
<s>  my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
mr </s>
<s>  and <abvr> hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession </s>
<s> 

and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it </s>
<s>  and we went into the churchyard
close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this
parish and also georgiana wife of the above </s>
<s>  and there my sister was
laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees </s>
<s> 

of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing
i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me </s>
<s>  and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property </s>
<s>  when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that
he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honor and
to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her death </s>
<s>  after that he drank all the rest of the sherry
and <abvr> hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since
observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal </s>
<s>  finally he went
away with <abvr> and <abvr> hubbleto make an evening of it i felt sure
and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor </s>
<s> 

when they were all gone and when trabb and his menbut not his boy </s>
<s>  i
looked for himhad crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too
the house felt wholesomer </s>
<s>  soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a
cold dinner together </s>
<s>  but we dined in the best parlor not in the old
kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great
restraint upon us </s>
<s>  but after dinner when i made him take his pipe
and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better </s>
<s>  i
noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to
make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress </s>
<s>  in which
the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was </s>
<s> 

he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little
room and i was pleased too </s>
<s>  for i felt that i had done rather a great
thing in making the request </s>
<s>  when the shadows of evening were closing
in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a
little talk </s>
<s> 

biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad
matters </s>
<s> 

do you <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  i should have written if i had thought
that </s>
<s> 

dont suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider
that you ought to have thought that </s>
<s> 

do you <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with
her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again </s>
<s>  after
looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up
that point </s>
<s> 

i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  i cant do so <abvr> pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction </s>
<s>  i have been speaking to <abvr> hubble and i am
going to her tomorrow </s>
<s>  i hope we shall be able to take some care of <abvr>
gargery together until he settles down </s>
<s> 

how are you going to live biddy </s>
<s>  if you want any mo

how am i going to live </s>
<s>  repeated biddy striking in with a momentary
flush upon her face </s>
<s>  ill tell you <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here </s>
<s>  i can be
well recommended by all the neighbors and i hope i can be industrious
and patient and teach myself while i teach others </s>
<s>  you know <abvr> pip
 pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new
schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after
that time and have had time since then to improve </s>
<s> 

i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy </s>
<s> 

it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud </s>
<s>  well </s>
<s> 
i thought i would give up that point too </s>
<s>  so i walked a little further
with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes </s>
<s> 

i have not heard the particulars of my sisters death biddy </s>
<s> 

they are very slight poor thing </s>
<s>  she had been in one of her bad
statesthough they had got better of late rather than worsefor four
days when she came out of it in the evening just at teatime and said
quite plainly ˜joe </s>
<s>  as she had never said any word for a long while i
ran and fetched in <abvr> gargery from the forge </s>
<s>  she made signs to me that
she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms
round his neck </s>
<s>  so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down
on his shoulder quite content and satisfied </s>
<s>  and so she presently said
˜joe again and once ˜pardon and once ˜pip </s>
<s>  and so she never lifted
her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her own bed because we found she was gone </s>
<s> 

biddy cried </s>
<s>  the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were
coming out were blurred in my own sight </s>
<s> 

nothing was ever discovered biddy </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s> 

do you know what is become of orlick </s>
<s> 

i should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the
quarries </s>
<s> 

of course you have seen him then </s>
<s> why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane </s>
<s> 

i saw him there on the night she died </s>
<s> 

that was not the last time either biddy </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i have seen him there since we have been walking here </s>
<s> it is of
no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running
out you know i would not deceive you </s>
<s>  he was not there a minute and
he is gone </s>
<s> 

it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
this fellow and i felt inveterate against him </s>
<s>  i told her so and told
her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
that country </s>
<s>  by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she
told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anythingshe
didnt say of me </s>
<s>  she had no need </s>
<s>  i knew what she meantbut ever did
his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a
gentle heart </s>
<s> 

indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i </s>
<s>  and biddy
we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down
here now </s>
<s>  i am not going to leave poor joe alone </s>
<s> 

biddy said never a single word </s>
<s> 

biddy dont you hear me </s>
<s> 

yes <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

not to mention your calling me <abvr> pipwhich appears to me to be in
bad taste biddywhat do you mean </s>
<s> 

what do i mean </s>
<s>  asked biddy timidly </s>
<s> 

biddy said i in a virtuously selfasserting manner i must request
to know what you mean by this </s>
<s> 

by this </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s> 

now dont echo i retorted </s>
<s>  you used not to echo biddy </s>
<s> 

used not </s>
<s>  said biddy </s>
<s>  o <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  used </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  i rather thought i would give up that point too </s>
<s>  after another
silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position </s>
<s> 

biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often
to see joe which you received with a marked silence </s>
<s>  have the goodness
biddy to tell me why </s>
<s> 

are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often </s>
<s>  asked
biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye </s>
<s> 

o dear me </s>
<s>  said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in
despair </s>
<s>  this really is a very bad side of human nature </s>
<s>  dont say any
more if you please biddy </s>
<s>  this shocks me very much </s>
<s> 

for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and
when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her
as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day </s>
<s>  as often as i was restless in the night and
that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what
an injury what an injustice biddy had done me </s>
<s> 

early in the morning i was to go </s>
<s>  early in the morning i was out and
looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge </s>
<s>  there
i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him were shining on it </s>
<s> 

goodbye dear joe </s>
<s> no dont wipe it offfor gods sake give me your
blackened hand </s>
<s> i shall be down soon and often </s>
<s> 

never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip </s>
<s> 

biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread </s>
<s>  biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting
i am not angry but i am hurt </s>
<s> 

no dont be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically </s>
<s>  let only me be
hurt if i have been ungenerous </s>
<s> 

once more the mists were rising as i walked away </s>
<s>  if they disclosed to
me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy
was quite right all i can say isthey were quite right too </s>

chapter xxxvi

herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our
debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary
transactions </s>
<s>  and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing </s>
<s> 
and i came of agein fulfilment of herberts prediction that i should
do so before i knew where i was </s>
<s> 

herbert himself had come of age eight months before me </s>
<s>  as he had
nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a
profound sensation in barnards inn </s>
<s>  but we had looked forward to
my oneandtwentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion </s>
<s> 

i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my
birthday was </s>
<s>  on the day before it i received an official note from
wemmick informing me that <abvr> jaggers would be glad if i would call
upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day </s>
<s>  this convinced
us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual
flutter when i repaired to my guardians office a model of punctuality </s>
<s> 

in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
tissuepaper that i liked the look of </s>
<s>  but he said nothing respecting
it and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room </s>
<s>  it was november
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimneypiece with his hands under his coattails </s>
<s> 

well pip said he i must call you <abvr> pip today </s>
<s>  congratulations
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s> 

we shook handshe was always a remarkably short shakerand i thanked
him </s>
<s> 

take a chair <abvr> pip said my guardian </s>
<s> 

as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when
i had been put upon a tombstone </s>
<s>  the two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation </s>
<s> 

now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the
box i am going to have a word or two with you </s>
<s> 

if you please sir </s>
<s> 

what do you suppose said <abvr> jaggers bending forward to look at the
ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceilingwhat
do you suppose you are living at the rate of </s>
<s> 

at the rate of sir </s>
<s> 

at repeated <abvr> jaggers still looking at the ceiling
therateof </s>
<s>  and then looked all round the room and paused with his
pockethandkerchief in his hand halfway to his nose </s>
<s> 

i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings </s>
<s>  reluctantly
i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question </s>
<s>  this reply
seemed agreeable to <abvr> jaggers who said i thought so </s>
<s>  and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction </s>
<s> 

now i have asked you a question my friend said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  have
you anything to ask me </s>
<s> 

of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions sir </s>
<s>  but i remember your prohibition </s>
<s> 

ask one said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

is my benefactor to be made known to me today </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  ask another </s>
<s> 

is that confidence to be imparted to me soon </s>
<s> 

waive that a moment said <abvr> jaggers and ask another </s>
<s> 

i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry haveianything to receive sir </s>
<s>  on that <abvr> jaggers
said triumphantly i thought we should come to it </s>
<s>  and called to
wemmick to give him that piece of paper </s>
<s>  wemmick appeared handed it in
and disappeared </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip said <abvr> jaggers attend if you please </s>
<s>  you have been
drawing pretty freely here </s>
<s>  your name occurs pretty often in wemmicks
cashbook </s>
<s>  but you are in debt of course </s>
<s> 

i am afraid i must say yes sir </s>
<s> 

you know you must say yes </s>
<s>  dont you </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

yes sir </s>
<s> 

i dont ask you what you owe because you dont know </s>
<s>  and if you did
know you wouldnt tell me </s>
<s>  you would say less </s>
<s>  yes yes my friend
 cried <abvr> jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show
of protesting </s>
<s>  its likely enough that you think you wouldnt but
you would </s>
<s>  youll excuse me but i know better than you </s>
<s>  now take this
piece of paper in your hand </s>
<s>  you have got it </s>
<s>  very good </s>
<s>  now unfold it
and tell me what it is </s>
<s> 

this is a banknote said i for five hundred pounds </s>
<s> 

that is a banknote repeated <abvr> jaggers for five hundred pounds </s>
<s> 
and a very handsome sum of money too i think </s>
<s>  you consider it so </s>
<s> 

how could i do otherwise </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  but answer the question said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

undoubtedly </s>
<s> 

you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money </s>
<s>  now that
handsome sum of money pip is your own </s>
<s>  it is a present to you on this
day in earnest of your expectations </s>
<s>  and at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears </s>
<s>  that is to say you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick
one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter until you are in
communication with the fountainhead and no longer with the mere
agent </s>
<s>  as i have told you before i am the mere agent </s>
<s>  i execute my
instructions and i am paid for doing so </s>
<s>  i think them injudicious but
i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits </s>
<s> 

i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which i was treated when <abvr> jaggers stopped me </s>
<s>  i am
not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one </s>
<s>  and
then gathered up his coattails as he had gathered up the subject and
stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
him </s>
<s> 

after a pause i hinted

there was a question just now <abvr> jaggers which you desired me to
waive for a moment </s>
<s>  i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s> 

i might have known that he would never help me out </s>
<s>  but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new </s>
<s>  is it
likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountainhead
you have spoken of <abvr> jaggers will soon there i delicately
stopped </s>
<s> 

will soon what </s>
<s>  asked <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  thats no question as it stands
you know </s>
<s> 

will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise
form of words or summon me anywhere else </s>
<s> 

now here replied <abvr> jaggers fixing me for the first time with
his dark deepset eyes we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village </s>
<s>  what did i tell you then pip </s>
<s> 

you told me <abvr> jaggers that it might be years hence when that person
appeared </s>
<s> 

just so said <abvr> jaggers thats my answer </s>
<s> 

as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him </s>
<s>  and as i felt that it came
quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him </s>
<s> 

do you suppose it will still be years hence <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers shook his headnot in negativing the question but in
altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
itand the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when
my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention and were going to sneeze </s>
<s> 

come </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs
of his warmed hands ill be plain with you my friend pip </s>
<s>  thats a
question i must not be asked </s>
<s>  youll understand that better when i tell
you its a question that might compromise me </s>
<s>  come </s>
<s>  ill go a little
further with you </s>
<s>  ill say something more </s>
<s> 

he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the
calves of his legs in the pause he made </s>
<s> 

when that person discloses said <abvr> jaggers straightening himself
you and that person will settle your own affairs </s>
<s>  when that person
discloses my part in this business will cease and determine </s>
<s>  when that
person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it </s>
<s>  and thats all i have got to say </s>
<s> 

we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked
thoughtfully at the floor </s>
<s>  from this last speech i derived the notion
that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him
into her confidence as to her designing me for estella </s>
<s>  that he resented
this and felt a jealousy about it </s>
<s>  or that he really did object to
that scheme and would have nothing to do with it </s>
<s>  when i raised my eyes
again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and
was doing so still </s>
<s> 

if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing
left for me to say </s>
<s> 

he nodded assent and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch and asked me
where i was going to dine </s>
<s>  i replied at my own chambers with herbert </s>
<s> 
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favor us with his
company and he promptly accepted the invitation </s>
<s>  but he insisted on
walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation
for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had
his hands to wash </s>
<s>  so i said i would go into the outer office and talk
to wemmick </s>
<s> 

the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before </s>
<s> 
and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought </s>
<s> 

he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home </s>
<s> 
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to
be extinguished </s>
<s>  he had raked his fire low put his hat and greatcoat
ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safekey as
an athletic exercise after business </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion </s>
<s>  i am very desirous
to serve a friend </s>
<s> 

wemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head as if his opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort </s>
<s> 

this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life
but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning </s>
<s>  now i want somehow to help him to a beginning </s>
<s> 

with money down </s>
<s>  said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust </s>
<s> 

with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at homewith some money down
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my
fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high
as chelsea reach </s>
<s>  lets see </s>
<s>  theres london one </s>
<s>  southwark two </s>
<s> 
blackfriars three </s>
<s>  waterloo four </s>
<s>  westminster five </s>
<s>  vauxhall six </s>
<s> 
 he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his
safekey on the palm of his hand </s>
<s>  theres as many as six you see to
choose from </s>
<s> 

i dont understand you said i </s>
<s> 

choose your bridge <abvr> pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon
your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch
of your bridge and you know the end of it </s>
<s>  serve a friend with it and
you may know the end of it toobut its a less pleasant and profitable
end </s>
<s> 

i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after
saying this </s>
<s> 

this is very discouraging said i </s>
<s> 

meant to be so said wemmick </s>
<s> 

then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation
that a man should never

invest portable property in a friend </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  certainly
he should not </s>
<s>  unless he wants to get rid of the friendand then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him </s>
<s> 

and that said i is your deliberate opinion <abvr> wemmick </s>
<s> 

that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole
here </s>
<s>  but would that be your opinion at walworth </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this
office is another </s>
<s>  much as the aged is one person and <abvr> jaggers is
another </s>
<s>  they must not be confounded together </s>
<s>  my walworth sentiments
must be taken at walworth </s>
<s>  none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office </s>
<s> 

very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at
walworth you may depend upon it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and
personal capacity </s>
<s> 

we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardians
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp </s>
<s>  as he now appeared in his doorway
towelling his hands wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff
out the candles </s>
<s>  we all three went into the street together and from
the doorstep wemmick turned his way and <abvr> jaggers and i turned ours </s>
<s> 

i could not help wishing more than once that evening that <abvr> jaggers
had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or
a somebody to unbend his brows a little </s>
<s>  it was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twentyfirst birthday that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it </s>
<s>  he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to
dinner </s>
<s>  and <abvr> jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because
after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the
fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it he felt so dejected and guilty </s>

chapter xxxvii

deeming sunday the best day for taking <abvr> wemmicks walworth
sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the castle </s>
<s>  on arriving before the battlements i found the union
jack flying and the drawbridge up </s>
<s>  but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the aged </s>
<s> 

my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather
had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word
that he would soon be home from his afternoons walk </s>
<s>  he is very regular
in his walks is my son </s>
<s>  very regular in everything is my son </s>
<s> 

i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and
we went in and sat down by the fireside </s>
<s> 

you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his
chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i
expect </s>
<s>  i nodded </s>
<s>  hah </s>
<s>  i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his business sir </s>
<s>  i nodded hard </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  so they tell me </s>
<s>  his business
is the law </s>
<s>  i nodded harder </s>
<s>  which makes it more surprising in my
son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to
the winecoopering </s>
<s> 

curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of <abvr> jaggers i roared that name at him </s>
<s>  he threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner no to be sure </s>
<s>  youre right </s>
<s>  and to this hour i
have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i
had made </s>

as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making
some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own
calling in life had been the winecoopering </s>
<s>  by dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood </s>

no said the old gentleman </s>

<s>  first
over yonder </s>
<s>  he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he
intended to refer me to liverpool </s>

however having an infirmityfor i am hard of hearing sir

i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment </s>
<s> 

yes hard of hearing </s>
<s>  having that infirmity coming upon me my son he
went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property </s>
<s>  but returning to what you
said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i
say is no to be sure </s>
<s>  youre right </s>
<s> 

i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with john upon it </s>
<s>  the old man following my eyes cried
with great triumph my sons come home </s>
<s>  and we both went out to the
drawbridge </s>
<s> 

it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease </s>
<s>  the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge
that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had
come across and had presented me to miss skiffins </s>
<s>  a lady by whom he
was accompanied </s>
<s> 

miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in
the postoffice branch of the service </s>
<s>  she might have been some two or
three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed
of portable property </s>
<s>  the cut of her dress from the waist upward both
before and behind made her figure very like a boys kite </s>
<s>  and i might
have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a
little too intensely green </s>
<s>  but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow
and showed a high regard for the aged </s>
<s>  i was not long in discovering
that she was a frequent visitor at the castle </s>
<s>  for on our going in
and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney and disappeared </s>
<s>  presently another click
came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it </s>
<s> 
then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open </s>
<s>  then miss skiffins
and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together </s>
<s>  on
wemmicks return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed
the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you
know theyre both pleasant and useful to the aged </s>
<s>  and by george sir
its a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to
this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss
skiffins and me </s>
<s> 

and <abvr> wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands
out of his own head </s>
<s> 

while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property
and see how the island looked in wintertime </s>
<s>  thinking that he did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle </s>
<s> 

having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i
had never hinted at it before </s>
<s>  i informed wemmick that i was anxious in
behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how
we had fought </s>
<s>  i glanced at herberts home and at his character and
at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for </s>
<s> 
those uncertain and unpunctual </s>
<s>  i alluded to the advantages i had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i
confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might
have done better without me and my expectations </s>
<s>  keeping miss havisham
in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of
his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts
retaliations or designs </s>
<s>  for all these reasons i told wemmick
and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great
affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmicks experience and
knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to
help herbert to some present incomesay of a hundred a year to keep
him in good hope and heartand gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership </s>
<s>  i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help
must always be rendered without herberts knowledge or suspicion and
that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise </s>
<s>  i
wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i cant help
confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you </s>
<s>  but that
is your fault in having ever brought me here </s>
<s> 

wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of
start well you know <abvr> pip i must tell you one thing </s>
<s>  this is
devilish good of you </s>
<s> 

say youll help me to be good then said i </s>
<s> 

ecod replied wemmick shaking his head thats not my trade </s>
<s> 

nor is this your tradingplace said i </s>
<s> 

you are right he returned </s>
<s>  you hit the nail on the head </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip
ill put on my consideringcap and i think all you want to do may be
done by degrees </s>
<s>  skiffins thats her brother is an accountant and
agent </s>
<s>  ill look him up and go to work for you </s>
<s> 

i thank you ten thousand times </s>
<s> 

on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there
are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away </s>
<s> 

after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into
the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea </s>
<s>  the responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger
of melting his eyes </s>
<s>  it was no nominal meal that we were going to make
but a vigorous reality </s>
<s>  the aged prepared such a haystack of buttered
toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the topbar </s>
<s>  while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and
repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment </s>
<s> 

the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right
moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep </s>
<s>  nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of
john and miss skiffins </s>
<s>  which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used
to it </s>
<s>  i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffinss
arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night </s>
<s>  and i rather
suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a
piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick </s>
<s> 

we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it </s>
<s>  the aged
especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe just oiled </s>
<s>  after a short pause of repose miss skiffinsin the
absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of
her family on sunday afternoonswashed up the teathings in a trifling
ladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us </s>
<s>  then she put on
her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now
aged parent tip us the paper </s>
<s> 

wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this
was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud </s>
<s>  i wont offer an apology said
wemmick for he isnt capable of many pleasuresare you aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself
spoken to </s>
<s> 

only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper
 said wemmick and hell be as happy as a king </s>
<s>  we are all attention
aged one </s>
<s> 

all right john all right </s>
<s>  returned the cheerful old man so busy and
so pleased that it really was quite charming </s>
<s> 

the ageds reading reminded me of the classes at <abvr> wopsles
greataunts with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole </s>
<s>  as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was
always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
them he required as much watching as a powdermill </s>
<s>  but wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on
quite unconscious of his many rescues </s>
<s>  whenever he looked at us we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he
resumed again </s>
<s> 

as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy
corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of <abvr> wemmicks mouth
powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round
miss skiffinss waist </s>
<s>  in course of time i saw his hand appear on the
other side of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  but at that moment miss skiffins neatly
stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were
an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her </s>
<s>  miss skiffinss composure while she did this was one
of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have
deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically </s>
<s> 

by and by i noticed wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again and
gradually fading out of view </s>
<s>  shortly afterwards his mouth began to
widen again </s>
<s>  after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side
of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid
it on the table </s>
<s>  taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the ageds reading
wemmicks arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by miss skiffins </s>
<s> 

at last the aged read himself into a light slumber </s>
<s>  this was the time
for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a
black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect </s>
<s>  with the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who
was soon awake again </s>
<s>  miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and
wemmick drank out of one glass </s>
<s>  of course i knew better than to offer to
see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best
go first </s>
<s>  which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having
passed a pleasant evening </s>
<s> 

before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth
stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would
be glad if i could come and see him again upon it </s>
<s>  so i went out
to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by
appointment in the city several times but never held any communication
with him on the subject in or near little britain </s>
<s>  the upshot was
that we found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker not long
established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted
capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner </s>
<s> 
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the
subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged
for sundry other payments </s>
<s>  some to fall due at certain dates out of my
income </s>
<s>  some contingent on my coming into my property </s>
<s>  miss skiffinss
brother conducted the negotiation </s>
<s>  wemmick pervaded it throughout but
never appeared in it </s>
<s> 

the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it </s>
<s>  i never shall forget the radiant
face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty
piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young
merchants name and of clarrikers having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at
last </s>
<s>  day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so
happy </s>
<s>  at length the thing being done and he having that day entered
clarrikers house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when
i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody </s>
<s> 

a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my
view </s>
<s>  but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all
the changes it involved i must give one </s>
<s> to estella </s>
<s>  it is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart </s>

chapter xxxviii

if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to
be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost </s>
<s>  o
the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when estella lived there </s>
<s>  let my body be where it
would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that
house </s>
<s> 

the lady with whom estella was placed <abvr> brandley by name was a
widow with one daughter several years older than estella </s>
<s>  the mother
looked young and the daughter looked old </s>
<s>  the mothers complexion was
pink and the daughters was yellow </s>
<s>  the mother set up for frivolity
and the daughter for theology </s>
<s>  they were in what is called a good
position and visited and were visited by numbers of people </s>
<s>  little
if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her and
that she was necessary to them </s>
<s>  <abvr> brandley had been a friend of miss
havishams before the time of her seclusion </s>
<s> 

in <abvr> brandleys house and out of <abvr> brandleys house i suffered
every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me </s>
<s>  the
nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor conduced to my distraction </s>
<s> 
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her </s>
<s>  if i had been her secretary steward
halfbrother poor relationif i had been a younger brother of her
appointed husbandi could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when i was nearest to her </s>
<s>  the privilege of calling her by her
name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials </s>
<s>  and while i think it likely that it almost
maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened
me </s>
<s> 

she had admirers without end </s>
<s>  no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her </s>
<s>  but there were more than enough of them
without that </s>
<s> 

i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used
often to take her and the brandleys on the water </s>
<s>  there were picnics
fÃªte days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures
through which i pursued herand they were all miseries to me </s>
<s>  i never
had one hours happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the
fourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me
unto death </s>
<s> 

throughout this part of our intercourseand it lasted as will
presently be seen for what i then thought a long timeshe habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us </s>
<s>  there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me </s>
<s> 

pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond </s>
<s>  will you never
take warning </s>
<s> 

of what </s>
<s> 

of me </s>
<s> 

warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella </s>
<s> 

do i mean </s>
<s>  if you dont know what i mean you are blind </s>
<s> 

i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the
reason that i always was restrainedand this was not the least of my
miseriesby a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her
when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham </s>
<s>  my
dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom </s>
<s> 

at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you
wrote to me to come to you this time </s>
<s> 

thats true said estella with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me </s>
<s> 

after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on
to say </s>
<s> 

the time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day
at satis </s>
<s>  you are to take me there and bring me back if you will </s>
<s>  she
would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid
for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people </s>
<s>  can
you take me </s>
<s> 

can i take you estella </s>
<s> 

you can then </s>
<s>  the day after tomorrow if you please </s>
<s>  you are to pay
all charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your going </s>
<s> 

and must obey said i </s>
<s> 

this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others
like it </s>
<s>  miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen
her handwriting </s>
<s>  we went down on the next day but one and we found her
in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that
there was no change in satis house </s>
<s> 

she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when
i last saw them together </s>
<s>  i repeat the word advisedly for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces </s>
<s> 
she hung upon estellas beauty hung upon her words hung upon her
gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at
her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared </s>
<s> 

from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds </s>
<s>  how does she use you pip </s>
<s>  how
does she use you </s>
<s>  she asked me again with her witchlike eagerness
even in estellas hearing </s>
<s>  but when we sat by her flickering fire
at night she was most weird </s>
<s>  for then keeping estellas hand drawn
through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her
by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular
letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated </s>
<s> 
and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch
stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a
very spectre </s>
<s> 

i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakenedi saw in this that
estella was set to wreak miss havishams revenge on men and that she
was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term </s>
<s>  i saw
in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me </s>
<s>  sending her
out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with
the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose </s>
<s>  i saw in
this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while
the prize was reserved for me </s>
<s>  i saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardians declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme </s>
<s>  in a word i
saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes
and always had had her before my eyes </s>
<s>  and i saw in this the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden
from the sun </s>
<s> 

the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall </s>
<s>  they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed </s>
<s>  as i looked
round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped
clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and
thrown back to me </s>
<s>  my thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor </s>
<s> 

it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between estella and miss havisham </s>
<s>  it was the first time i had ever seen
them opposed </s>
<s> 

we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham
still had estellas arm drawn through her own and still clutched
estellas hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself </s>
<s> 
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired
of me </s>
<s> 

only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm
and moving to the great chimneypiece where she stood looking down at
the fire </s>
<s> 

speak the truth you ingrate </s>
<s>  cried miss havisham passionately
striking her stick upon the floor </s>
<s>  you are tired of me </s>
<s> 

estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down
at the fire </s>
<s>  her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a
selfpossessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was
almost cruel </s>
<s> 

you stock and stone </s>
<s>  exclaimed miss havisham </s>
<s>  you cold cold heart </s>
<s> 

what </s>
<s>  said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she
leaned against the great chimneypiece and only moving her eyes </s>
<s>  do you
reproach me for being cold </s>
<s>  you </s>
<s> 

are you not </s>
<s>  was the fierce retort </s>
<s> 

you should know said estella </s>
<s>  i am what you have made me </s>
<s>  take
all the praise take all the blame </s>
<s>  take all the success take all the
failure </s>
<s>  in short take me </s>
<s> 

o look at her look at her </s>
<s>  cried miss havisham bitterly </s>
<s>  look at
her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared </s>
<s>  where i
took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its
stabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon her </s>
<s> 

at least i was no party to the compact said estella for if i could
walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do </s>
<s>  but what
would you have </s>
<s>  you have been very good to me and i owe everything to
you </s>

estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was
not otherwise disturbed </s>

the fire again </s>

daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and
angry </s>

miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and
swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer </s>
<s> 

or said estellawhich is a nearer caseif you had taught her
from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might

blighted you and would else blight her </s>

the ruined garden </s>
<s>  when i at last took courage to return to the room i
found estella sitting at miss havishams knee taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and
of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals </s>
<s>  afterwards estella
and i played at cards as of yoreonly we were skilful now and played
french gamesand so the evening wore away and i went to bed </s>
<s> 

i lay in that separate building across the courtyard </s>
<s>  it was the first
time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to
come near me </s>
<s>  a thousand miss havishams haunted me </s>
<s>  she was on this side
of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the
halfopened door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the room
overhead in the room beneatheverywhere </s>
<s>  at last when the night was
slow to creep on towards two oclock i felt that i absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up </s>
<s> 
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind </s>
<s>  but i was no sooner in the passage
than i extinguished my candle </s>
<s>  for i saw miss havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner making a low cry </s>
<s>  i followed her at a distance
and saw her go up the staircase </s>
<s>  she carried a bare candle in her hand
which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room
and was a most unearthly object by its light </s>
<s>  standing at the bottom
of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feastchamber without
seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across
into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low
cry </s>
<s>  after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back
but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands </s>
<s>  during the whole interval whenever i went to
the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass
above and heard her ceaseless low cry </s>
<s> 

before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between
her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion </s>
<s>  and
there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance </s>
<s>  nor
did miss havishams manner towards estella in anywise change except
that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley
drummles name upon it </s>
<s>  or i would very gladly </s>
<s> 

on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodys agreeing
with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order
forasmuch as <abvr> drummle had not yet toasted a lady </s>
<s>  which according
to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brutes turn to
do that day </s>
<s>  i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us
that might easily be </s>
<s>  what was my indignant surprise when he called upon
the company to pledge him to estella </s>
<s> 

estella who </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

never you mind retorted drummle </s>
<s> 

estella of where </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  you are bound to say of where </s>
<s>  which he
was as a finch </s>
<s> 

of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question
and a peerless beauty </s>
<s> 

much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot </s>
<s>  i
whispered herbert </s>
<s> 

i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had
been honored </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

and so do i i added with a scarlet face </s>
<s> 

do you </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s>  o lord </s>
<s> 

this was the only retortexcept glass or crockerythat the heavy
creature was capable of making </s>
<s>  but i became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place
and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honorable
finchs impudence to come down to that grovewe always talked
about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of
expressiondown to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew
nothing </s>
<s>  <abvr> drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by
that </s>
<s>  whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew
where i was to be found </s>
<s> 

whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood
after this was a question on which the finches were divided </s>
<s>  the debate
upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honorable members
told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where
they were to be found </s>
<s>  however it was decided at last the grove being
a court of honor that if <abvr> drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honor of her
acquaintance <abvr> pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a
finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which </s>
<s>  next day was
appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from
delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
estellas hand that she had had the honor of dancing with him several
times </s>
<s>  this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed
into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the
idea that i was to be found anywhere </s>
<s>  drummle and i then sat snorting
at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate </s>
<s> 

i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me </s>
<s>  for i cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should
show any favor to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below
the average </s>
<s>  to the present moment i believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound </s>
<s> 
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored </s>
<s>  but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress </s>
<s> 

it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle
had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it </s>
<s>  a
little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed
one another every day </s>
<s>  he held on in a dull persistent way and estella
held him on </s>
<s>  now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost
flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now
scarcely remembering who he was </s>
<s> 

the spider as <abvr> jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait
however and had the patience of his tribe </s>
<s>  added to that he had a
blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness
which sometimes did him good servicealmost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose </s>
<s>  so the spider doggedly watching
estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time </s>
<s> 

at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls
at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties
this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration
on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him </s>
<s>  i took the
next opportunity </s>
<s>  which was when she was waiting for <abvr> blandley to
take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go </s>
<s> 
i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such
places </s>
<s> 

are you tired estella </s>
<s> 

rather pip </s>
<s> 

you should be </s>
<s> 

say rather i should not be </s>
<s>  for i have my letter to satis house to

<s>  surely a very poor one
estella </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  i didnt know there had been any </s>
<s> 

estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is
looking over here at us </s>
<s> 

why should i look at him </s>
<s>  returned estella with her eyes on me
instead </s>
<s>  what is there in that fellow in the corner yonderto use
your wordsthat i need look at </s>
<s> 

indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i </s>
<s>  for he
has been hovering about you all night </s>
<s> 

moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied estella with a glance
towards him hover about a lighted candle </s>
<s>  can the candle help it </s>
<s> 

no i returned </s>
<s>  but cannot the estella help it </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she laughing after a moment perhaps </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  anything you
like </s>
<s> 

but estella do hear me speak </s>
<s>  it makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as drummle </s>
<s>  you know he is
despised </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

you know he is as ungainly within as without </s>
<s>  a deficient
illtempered lowering stupid fellow </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she </s>
<s> 

you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
roll of addleheaded predecessors </s>
<s>  now dont you </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said she again </s>
<s>  and each time she said it she opened her lovely
eyes the wider </s>
<s> 

to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it
from her and said repeating it with emphasis well </s>
<s>  then that is why
it makes me wretched </s>
<s> 

now if i could have believed that she favored drummle with any idea of
making memewretched i should have been in better heart about it </s>
<s> 
but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the
question that i could believe nothing of the kind </s>
<s> 

pip said estella casting her glance over the room dont be foolish
about its effect on you </s>
<s>  it may have its effect on others and may be
meant to have </s>
<s>  its not worth discussing </s>
<s> 

yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say ˜she
throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the
crowd </s>
<s> 

i can bear it said estella </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  dont be so proud estella and so inflexible </s>
<s> 

calls me proud and inflexible in this breath </s>
<s>  said estella opening
her hands </s>
<s>  and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor </s>
<s> 

there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have
seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never
give tome </s>
<s> 

do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and
serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you </s>
<s> 

do you deceive and entrap him estella </s>
<s> 

yes and many othersall of them but you </s>
<s>  here is <abvr> brandley </s>
<s>  ill
say no more </s>
<s> 

 

and now that i have given the one </s>
<s> to the theme that so filled my
heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered
to the event that had impended over me longer yet </s>
<s>  the event that had
begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella
and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first
distortions from miss havishams wasting hands </s>
<s> 

in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the
tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through
the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof
the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to
the great iron ring </s>
<s>  all being made ready with much labor and the hour
come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened
axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his
hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and
the ceiling fell </s>
<s>  so in my case </s>
<s>  all the work near and afar that
tended to the end had been accomplished </s>

struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me </s>

inability to settle to anythingwhich i hope arose out of the restless

reading and read regularly so many hours a day </s>
<s>  that matter of
herberts was still progressing and everything with me was as i have
brought it down to the close of the last preceding </s>
<s> </s>
<s> 

business had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles </s>
<s>  i was alone and
had a dull sense of being alone </s>
<s>  dispirited and anxious long hoping
that tomorrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i
sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend </s>
<s> 

it was wretched weather </s>
<s>  stormy and wet stormy and wet </s>
<s>  and mud mud
mud deep in all the streets </s>
<s>  day after day a vast heavy veil had been
driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east
there were an eternity of cloud and wind </s>
<s>  so furious had been the gusts
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs </s>
<s> 
and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills
carried away </s>
<s>  and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of
shipwreck and death </s>
<s>  violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages
of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the
worst of all </s>
<s> 

alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time
and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so
exposed to the river </s>
<s>  we lived at the top of the last house and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges
of cannon or breakings of a sea </s>
<s>  when the rain came with it and dashed
against the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they
rocked that i might have fancied myself in a stormbeaten lighthouse </s>
<s> 
occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could
not bear to go out into such a night </s>
<s>  and when i set the doors open and
looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out </s>
<s>  and when
i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows
opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of
such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out
and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and
that the coalfires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain </s>
<s> 

i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book
at eleven oclock </s>
<s>  as i shut it saint pauls and all the many
churchclocks in the citysome leading some accompanying some

when i heard a footstep on the stair </s>
<s> 

what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister matters not </s>
<s>  it was past in a moment and i
listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on </s>
<s> 
remembering then that the staircaselights were blown out i took up
my readinglamp and went out to the stairhead </s>

stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet </s>

there is some one down there is there not </s>

down </s>

yes said a voice from the darkness beneath </s>

what floor do you want </s>

the top </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

that is my name </s>

<s> 

nothing the matter returned the voice </s>
<s>  and the man came on </s>
<s> 

i stood with my lamp held out over the stairrail and he came slowly
within its light </s>
<s>  it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its
circle of light was very contracted </s>
<s>  so that he was in it for a mere
instant and then out of it </s>
<s>  in the instant i had seen a face that was
strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched
and pleased by the sight of me </s>
<s> 

moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially
dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea </s>
<s>  that he had long irongray
hair </s>
<s>  that his age was about sixty </s>
<s>  that he was a muscular man strong
on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to
weather </s>
<s>  as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp
included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was
holding out both his hands to me </s>
<s> 

pray what is your business </s>
<s>  i asked him </s>
<s> 

my business </s>
<s>  he repeated pausing </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  i will explain my
business by your leave </s>

do you wish to come in </s>

yes he replied </s>
<s>  i wish to come in master </s>
<s> 

i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the
sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face </s>
<s> 
i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond
to it </s>
<s>  but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the
lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself </s>
<s> 

he looked about him with the strangest airan air of wondering
pleasure as if he had some part in the things he admiredand he
pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat </s>
<s>  then i saw that his head
was furrowed and bald and that the long irongray hair grew only on
its sides </s>
<s>  but i saw nothing that in the least explained him </s>
<s>  on the
contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands to
me </s>
<s> 

what do you mean </s>
<s>  said i half suspecting him to be mad </s>

he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over
his head </s>

youre not to blame for thatneither on us is to blame for that </s>

he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his

fire </s>

he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands </s>

he laid his hand on my shoulder </s>

anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood </s>

it warnt easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warnt
safe </s>
<s>  but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for
i was determined and my mind firm made up </s>
<s>  at last i done it </s>
<s>  dear boy
i done it </s>
<s> 

i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned </s>
<s>  throughout i had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him </s>
<s> 
even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those
were loud and his was silent </s>
<s> 

where will you put me </s>
<s>  he asked presently </s>
<s>  i must be put somewheres
dear boy </s>

to sleep </s>
<s>  said i </s>

yes </s>

<s>  for ive been
seatossed and seawashed months and months </s>

my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent </s>

must have his room </s>
<s> 

he wont come back tomorrow </s>

<s> 

no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost
efforts </s>

<s> 

because lookee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is
necessary </s>
<s> 

how do you mean </s>
<s>  caution </s>
<s> 

by g its death </s>
<s> 

whats death </s>
<s> 

i was sent for life </s>
<s>  its death to come back </s>
<s>  theres been overmuch
coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if
took </s>
<s> 

nothing was needed but this </s>
<s>  the wretched man after loading wretched me
with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come
to me and i held it there in my keeping </s>
<s>  if i had loved him instead
of abhorring him </s>
<s>  if i had been attracted to him by the strongest
admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the
strongest repugnance </s>
<s>  it could have been no worse </s>
<s>  on the contrary it
would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart </s>
<s> 

my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen
from without and then to close and make fast the doors </s>
<s>  while i did so
he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit </s>
<s>  and when i saw
him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again </s>
<s>  it
almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his
leg </s>
<s> 

when i had gone into herberts room and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed </s>
<s> 
he said yes but asked me for some of my gentlemans linen to put
on in the morning </s>
<s>  i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my
blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good
night </s>
<s> 

i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go
to bed </s>
<s>  for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think </s>
<s>  and it
was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i
was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces </s>
<s> 

miss havishams intentions towards me all a mere dream </s>
<s>  estella not
designed for me </s>
<s>  i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a
sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand </s>
<s>  those were the first
smarts i had </s>
<s>  but sharpest and deepest pain of allit was for the
convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door
that i had deserted joe </s>
<s> 

i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to
biddy now for any consideration </s>
<s>  simply i suppose because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration </s>
<s> 
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity </s>
<s>  but i could never never
undo what i had done </s>
<s> 

in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers </s>
<s>  twice i could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door </s>
<s>  with
these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had
mysterious warnings of this mans approach </s>
<s>  that for weeks gone by i
had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his </s>
<s>  that these
likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had
drawn nearer </s>
<s>  that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word
and with me </s>
<s> 

crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen
him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man </s>
<s>  that i had
heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him </s>
<s>  that
i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast </s>
<s>  out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a
halfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him in the dead of the wild solitary night </s>
<s>  this dilated until it filled
the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden </s>
<s> 

he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and
lowering in his sleep </s>
<s>  but he was asleep and quietly too though he had
a pistol lying on the pillow </s>
<s>  assured of this i softly removed the key
to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down
by the fire </s>
<s>  gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor </s>
<s> 
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five
the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness </s>
<s> 

this is the end of the second stage of pips expectations </s>
<s> 




chapter xl

it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far
as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor </s>
<s>  for this thought pressing
on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance </s>
<s> 

the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
selfevident </s>
<s>  it could not be done and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion </s>
<s>  true i had no avenger in my service now
but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an
animated ragbag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration </s>
<s>  they both had
weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted </s>
<s>  indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny </s>
<s>  not to get up a mystery
with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country </s>
<s> 

this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light </s>
<s>  not stumbling on the means after all
i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his lantern </s>
<s>  now in groping my way down the black staircase i
fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner </s>
<s> 

as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded
my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly </s>
<s>  telling him of the incident on the way back </s>
<s>  the wind being as
fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there </s>
<s>  it then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms </s>
<s>  so lighting my candle at the watchmans and leaving him
standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep </s>
<s>  all was quiet and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers </s>
<s> 

it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on
that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram
at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out </s>
<s>  yes he said </s>
<s>  at different times of the
night three </s>
<s>  one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in
the lane and he had seen them all go home </s>
<s>  again the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the
night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
upstairs </s>
<s> 

the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back
my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate </s>
<s>  besides them three
gentlemen that i have named i dont call to mind another since about
eleven oclock when a stranger asked for you </s>
<s> 

my uncle i muttered </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s> 

you saw him sir </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  oh yes </s>
<s> 

likewise the person with him </s>
<s> 

person with him </s>
<s>  i repeated </s>
<s> 

i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman </s>
<s>  the person
stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this
way when he took this way </s>
<s> 

what sort of person </s>
<s> 

the watchman had not particularly noticed </s>
<s>  he should say a working
person </s>
<s>  to the best of his belief he had a dustcolored kind of clothes
on under a dark coat </s>
<s>  the watchman made more light of the matter than i
did and naturally </s>
<s>  not having my reason for attaching weight to it </s>
<s> 

when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together </s>
<s>  whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apartas for instance some diner out or diner at home
who had not gone near this watchmans gate might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep thereand my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him to show him the waystill joined they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me </s>
<s> 

i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning and fell into a doze before it </s>
<s>  i seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six </s>
<s>  as there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight i dozed again </s>
<s>  now waking up uneasily
with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears </s>
<s>  now making thunder
of the wind in the chimney </s>
<s>  at length falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start </s>
<s> 

all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor
could i do so yet </s>
<s>  i had not the power to attend to it </s>
<s>  i was greatly
dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way </s>
<s> 
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an
elephant </s>
<s>  when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning all of a leaden hue </s>
<s>  when i walked from room to room </s>
<s>  when i
sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to
appear </s>
<s>  i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long
i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even
who i was that made it </s>
<s> 

at last the old woman and the niece came inthe latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her dusty broomand testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire </s>
<s>  to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly </s>
<s>  then i washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust </s>
<s>  and so in a sort of dream
or sleepwaking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting
forhimto come to breakfast </s>
<s> 

by and by his door opened and he came out </s>
<s>  i could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight </s>
<s> 

i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the
table by what name to call you </s>
<s>  i have given out that you are my
uncle </s>
<s> 

thats it dear boy </s>
<s>  call me uncle </s>
<s> 

you assumed some name i suppose on board ship </s>
<s> 

yes dear boy </s>
<s>  i took the name of provis </s>
<s> 

do you mean to keep that name </s>
<s> 

why yes dear boy its as good as anotherunless youd like

<s> 

magwitch he answered in the same tone </s>
<s>  chrisend abel </s>
<s> 

what were you brought up to be </s>
<s> 

a warmint dear boy </s>
<s> 

he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some
profession </s>
<s> 

when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long
ago </s>
<s> 

yes dear boy </s>
<s> 

when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had
you any one with you </s>
<s> 

with me </s>
<s>  no dear boy </s>
<s> 

but there was some one there </s>
<s> 

i didnt take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the
ways of the place </s>
<s>  but i think there was a person too come in alonger
me </s>
<s> 

are you known in london </s>
<s> 

i hope not </s>
<s>  said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick </s>

were you known in london once </s>

not over and above dear boy </s>
<s>  i was in the provinces mostly </s>
<s>

the last time </s>
<s> 

he nodded </s>
<s>  first knowed <abvr> jaggers that way </s>
<s>  jaggers was for me </s>
<s> 

it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up
a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is
worked out and paid for </s>
<s>  fell to at his breakfast </s>
<s> 

he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions
were uncouth noisy and greedy </s>
<s>  some of his teeth had failed him since
i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth
and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon
it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog </s>
<s>  if i had begun with any
appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as
i didrepelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily
looking at the cloth </s>
<s> 

im a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology
when he made an end of his meal but i always was </s>
<s>  if it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter
trouble </s>
<s>  similarly i must have my smoke </s>
<s>  when i was first hired out as
shepherd tother side the world its my belief i should ha turned into
a molloncollymad sheep myself if i hadnt a had my smoke </s>
<s> 

as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the
breast of the peacoat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negrohead </s>
<s>  having
filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket
were a drawer </s>
<s>  then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs
and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearthrug with
his back to the fire and went through his favorite action of holding
out both his hands for mine </s>
<s> 

and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed
at his pipeand this is the gentleman what i made </s>
<s>  the real genuine
one </s>
<s>  it does me good fur to look at you pip </s>
<s>  all i stiplate is to
stand by and look at you dear boy </s>
<s> 

i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition </s>
<s>  what i was
chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his
hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides </s>
<s> 

i mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets </s>
<s> 
there mustnt be no mud on his boots </s>
<s>  my gentleman must have horses
pip </s>

˜uns if you please good lord </s>
<s>  and not my london gentleman </s>
<s>  no no </s>
<s> 
well show ˜em another pair of shoes than that pip </s>

he took out of his pocket a great thick pocketbook bursting with
papers and tossed it on the table </s>

 he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with
a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the
colonist a stirring up the dust ill show a better gentleman than the
whole kit on you put together </s>
<s>

be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you

altered and subdued manner </s>

his jaw as he stared at me </s>

where are you to live </s>

<s> 

you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last
night when you swore it was death </s>
<s> 

and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his
mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and
its serious that you should fully understand it to be so </s>

<s>  if theres death hid inside of it there is
and let him come out and ill face him and then ill believe in him
and not afore </s>
<s>  and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen </s>
<s> 

once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship </s>
<s>  smoking with great complacency all the while </s>
<s> 

it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert
returned </s>
<s>  whom i expected in two or three days </s>
<s>  that the secret must
be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i
could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with
him out of the question was plain to me </s>
<s>  but it was by no means so
plain to <abvr> provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved
his consent to herberts participation until he should have seen him
and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy </s>
<s>  and even then dear
boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of
his pocket well have him on his oath </s>
<s> 

to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to
state what i never quite established </s>
<s>  but this i can say that i never
knew him put it to any other use </s>
<s>  the book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge
of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave
him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm </s>
<s>  on this
first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself
last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude </s>
<s> 

as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next
discussed with him what dress he should wear </s>
<s>  he cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist </s>
<s>  it was with considerable
difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmers </s>
<s>  and we arranged that he should cut his hair close
and wear a little powder </s>
<s>  lastly as he had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until
his change of dress was made </s>
<s> 

it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions </s>
<s>  but in my
dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon </s>
<s>  he was to
remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account
to open the door </s>
<s> 

there being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in essex street
the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of
my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle <abvr> provis </s>
<s>  i then went from
shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his appearance </s>
<s>  this business transacted i turned my face on my own
account to little britain </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers was at his desk but seeing me
enter got up immediately and stood before his fire </s>
<s> 

now pip said he be careful </s>
<s> 

i will sir i returned </s>
<s>  for coming along i had thought well of what
i was going to say </s>
<s> 

dont commit yourself said <abvr> jaggers and dont commit any one </s>

you understandany one </s>
<s>  dont tell me anything </s>
<s>  i dont want to know
anything </s>
<s>  i am not curious </s>
<s> 

of course i saw that he knew the man was come </s>

i merely want <abvr> jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have
been told is true </s>
<s>  i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i
may verify it </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers nodded </s>
<s>  but did you say ˜told or ˜informed </s>
<s>  he asked
me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in
a listening way at the floor </s>

communication </s>
<s>  you cant have verbal communication with a man in new

<s> 

i will say informed <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>

i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the

that is the man said <abvr> jaggers in new south wales </s>

<s> 

and only he said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions </s>
<s>  but i always supposed it was miss
havisham </s>
<s> 

as you say pip returned <abvr> jaggers turning his eyes upon
me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all
responsible for that </s>
<s> 

and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart </s>
<s> 

not a particle of evidence pip said <abvr> jaggers shaking his head
and gathering up his skirts </s>
<s>  take nothing on its looks </s>
<s>  take everything
on evidence </s>
<s>  theres no better rule </s>
<s> 

i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for
a little while </s>
<s>  i have verified my information and theres an end </s>
<s> 

and magwitchin new south waleshaving at last disclosed himself
 said <abvr> jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout
my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of
fact </s>
<s>  there has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact </s>
<s>  you are quite aware of that </s>
<s> 

quite sir </s>
<s> 

i communicated to magwitchin new south waleswhen he first wrote to
mefrom new south walesthe caution that he must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact </s>
<s>  i also communicated to him another
caution </s>
<s>  he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at
some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here </s>
<s>  i cautioned
him that i must hear no more of that </s>
<s>  that he was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon </s>
<s>  that he was expatriated for the term of his natural
life </s>
<s>  and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law </s>
<s>  i gave
magwitch that caution said <abvr> jaggers looking hard at me </s>
<s>  i wrote
it to new south wales </s>
<s>  he guided himself by it no doubt </s>
<s> 

no doubt said i </s>
<s> 

i have been informed by wemmick pursued <abvr> jaggers still looking
hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from
a colonist of the name of purvis or

or provis i suggested </s>
<s> 

or provisthank you pip </s>
<s>  perhaps it is provis </s>
<s>  perhaps you know its
provis </s>
<s> 

yes said i </s>
<s> 

you know its provis </s>
<s>  a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist
of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on
behalf of magwitch </s>
<s>  wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by
return of post </s>
<s>  probably it is through provis that you have received the
explanation of magwitchin new south wales </s>
<s> 

it came through provis i replied </s>
<s> 

good day pip said <abvr> jaggers offering his hand </s>
<s>  glad to have
seen you </s>
<s>  in writing by post to magwitchin new south walesor in
communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you
together with the balance </s>
<s>  for there is still a balance remaining </s>
<s>  good
day pip </s>
<s> 

we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me </s>
<s>  i
turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open
and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is </s>
<s> 

wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done
nothing for me </s>
<s>  i went straight back to the temple where i found
the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead in
safety </s>
<s> 

next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on </s>
<s> 
whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what
he had worn before </s>
<s>  to my thinking there was something in him that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him </s>
<s>  the more i dressed him and the
better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes </s>
<s>  this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no
doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me </s>
<s>  but i
believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in
the very grain of the man </s>
<s> 

the influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame </s>
<s>  added to these were the
influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all
his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now </s>
<s>  in all his ways of
sitting and standing and eating and drinkingof brooding about in a
highshouldered reluctant styleof taking out his great hornhandled
jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his foodof
lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy
pannikinsof chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the
most of an allowance and then drying his fingerends on it and then
swallowing itin these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon
bondsman plain as plain could be </s>
<s> 

it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts </s>
<s>  but i can compare the
effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead </s>
<s>  so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was
most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head </s>
<s>  it was
abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short </s>
<s> 

words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful
mystery that he was to me </s>
<s>  when he fell asleep of an evening with his
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair and his bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit
and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all
the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him </s>
<s>  every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and
the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back </s>
<s> 
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with
everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier </s>
<s> 

i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the
rain always rushing by </s>
<s>  a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that
he would be were no small addition to my horrors </s>
<s>  when he was not
asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his owna game that i never saw before or since and in which
he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the tablewhen
he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to
read to himforeign language dear boy </s>
<s>  while i complied he not
comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers
of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency </s>
<s>  the imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more
wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling
from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the
fonder he was of me </s>
<s> 

this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year </s>
<s>  it lasted
about five days </s>
<s>  expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out
except when i took provis for an airing after dark </s>
<s>  at length one
evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite
worn outfor my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreamsi was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase </s>
<s>  provis
who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an
instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand </s>
<s> 

quiet </s>
<s>  its herbert </s>
<s>  i said </s>
<s>  and herbert came bursting in with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him </s>
<s> 

handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again
how are you </s>
<s>  i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth </s>
<s>  why so i must have
been for you have grown quite thin and pale </s>

<s>  i beg
your pardon </s>
<s> 

he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by
seeing provis </s>
<s>  provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly
putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something
else </s>
<s> 

herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while
herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has
happened </s>
<s>  this isa visitor of mine </s>
<s> 

its all right dear boy </s>
<s>  said provis coming forward with his little
clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert </s>
<s>  take it in
your right hand </s>
<s>  lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in
any way sumever </s>
<s>  kiss it </s>
<s> 

do so as he wishes it i said to herbert </s>
<s>  so herbert looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis
immediately shaking hands with him said now youre on your oath you

chapter xli

in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i
recounted the whole of the secret </s>
<s>  enough that i saw my own feelings
reflected in herberts face and not least among them my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me </s>
<s> 

what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there
had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story </s>
<s> 
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since
his returnon which point he began to hold forth to herbert the
moment my revelation was finishedhe had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune </s>
<s>  his boast that
he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the
character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for
himself </s>
<s>  and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us
and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite
established in his own mind </s>
<s> 

though lookee here pips comrade he said to herbert after having
discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come
backfor half a minuteive been low </s>
<s>  i said to pip i knowed as i had
been low </s>
<s>  but dont you fret yourself on that score </s>
<s>  i aint made pip a
gentleman and pip aint a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not
to know whats due to ye both </s>
<s>  dear boy and pips comrade you two may
count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on </s>
<s>  muzzled i have been
since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am
at the present time muzzled i ever will be </s>
<s> 

herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed </s>
<s>  we were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat
late </s>
<s>  it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and
saw him safely in at his own dark door </s>
<s>  when it closed upon him i
experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of
his arrival </s>
<s> 

never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs
i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in
bringing him back </s>
<s>  and i looked about me now </s>
<s>  difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements </s>
<s>  the few who were
passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i
turned back into the temple </s>
<s>  nobody had come out at the gate with us
nobody went in at the gate with me </s>
<s>  as i crossed by the fountain i saw
his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going
up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when i ascended it </s>
<s> 

herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend </s>
<s>  when he had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the
question what was to be done </s>
<s> 

the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stoodfor he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in
one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with
his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards
and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slatei say his
chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but
next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another </s>
<s>  he had
no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
patron neither had i occasion to confess my own </s>
<s>  we interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable </s>
<s> 

what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chairwhat is
to be done </s>
<s> 

my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned
to think </s>
<s> 

so was i herbert when the blow first fell </s>
<s>  still something must be
done </s>
<s>  he is intent upon various new expenseshorses and carriages
and lavish appearances of all kinds </s>
<s>  he must be stopped somehow </s>
<s> 

you mean that you cant accept

how can i </s>
<s>  i interposed as herbert paused </s>
<s>  think of him </s>
<s>  look at
him </s>
<s> 

an involuntary shudder passed over both of us </s>
<s> 

yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to
me strongly attached to me </s>
<s>  was there ever such a fate </s>
<s> 

my poor dear handel herbert repeated </s>
<s> 

then said i after all stopping short here never taking another
penny from him think what i owe him already </s>
<s>  then again </s>
<s>  i am heavily
in debtvery heavily for me who have now no expectationsand i have
been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing </s>
<s> 

well well well </s>
<s>  herbert remonstrated </s>
<s>  dont say fit for nothing </s>
<s> 

what am i fit for </s>
<s>  i know only one thing that i am fit for and that
is to go for a soldier </s>
<s>  and i might have gone my dear herbert but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection </s>
<s> 

of course i broke down there </s>
<s>  and of course herbert beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it </s>
<s> 

anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering wont do </s>
<s>  if
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors i suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had </s>
<s>  not very strong that hope if you went soldiering </s>
<s> 
besides its absurd </s>
<s>  you would be infinitely better in clarrikers
house small as it is </s>
<s>  i am working up towards a partnership you know </s>
<s> 

poor fellow </s>
<s>  he little suspected with whose money </s>
<s> 

but there is another question said herbert </s>
<s>  this is an ignorant
determined man who has long had one fixed idea </s>
<s>  more than that he
seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character </s>
<s> 

i know he is i returned </s>
<s>  let me tell you what evidence i have seen
of it </s>
<s>  and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that
encounter with the other convict </s>
<s> 

see then said herbert </s>
<s>  think of this </s>
<s>  he comes here at the peril
of his life for the realization of his fixed idea </s>
<s>  in the moment of
realization after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from
under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him </s>
<s> 
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment </s>
<s> 

i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night
of his arrival </s>
<s>  nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
putting himself in the way of being taken </s>
<s> 

then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great
danger of his doing it </s>
<s>  that is his power over you as long as he remains
in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him </s>
<s> 

i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon
me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard
myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my
chair but began pacing to and fro </s>
<s>  i said to herbert meanwhile that
even if provis were recognized and taken in spite of himself i should
be wretched as the cause however innocently </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  even though i was so
wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would
ever have come to this </s>
<s> 

but there was no staving off the question what was to be done </s>
<s> 

the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him
out of england </s>
<s>  you will have to go with him and then he may be induced
to go </s>
<s> 

but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back </s>
<s> 

my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and
making him reckless here than elsewhere </s>
<s>  if a pretext to get him away
could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his
life now </s>
<s> 

there again </s>
<s>  said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held
out as if they contained the desperation of the case </s>
<s>  i know nothing
of his life </s>
<s>  it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so
unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood </s>
<s> 

herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and
fro together studying the carpet </s>
<s> 

handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

fully </s>
<s>  surely you would too if you were in my place </s>
<s> 

and you feel convinced that you must break with him </s>
<s> 

herbert can you ask me </s>
<s> 

and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he
has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from
throwing it away </s>
<s>  then you must get him out of england before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself </s>
<s>  that done extricate yourself in heavens
name and well see it out together dear old boy </s>
<s> 

it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again
with only that done </s>
<s> 

now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of
his history </s>
<s>  there is but one way that i know of </s>
<s>  i must ask him point
blank </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morning </s>
<s> 
 for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would come to
breakfast with us </s>
<s> 

with this project formed we went to bed </s>
<s>  i had the wildest dreams
concerning him and woke unrefreshed </s>
<s>  i woke too to recover the fear
which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned
transport </s>
<s>  waking i never lost that fear </s>
<s> 

he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat
down to his meal </s>
<s>  he was full of plans for his gentlemans coming out
strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon
the pocketbook which he had left in my possession </s>
<s>  he considered the
chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to
look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he
could have a shakedown </s>
<s>  when he had made an end of his breakfast
and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of
preface

after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that
the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up </s>
<s>  you
remember </s>
<s> 

remember </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  i think so </s>
<s> 

we want to know something about that manand about you </s>
<s>  it is strange
to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to
tell last night </s>
<s>  is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  he said after consideration </s>
<s>  youre on your oath you know
pips comrade </s>
<s> 

assuredly replied herbert </s>
<s> 

as to anything i say you know he insisted </s>
<s>  the oath applies to
all </s>
<s> 

i understand it to do so </s>
<s> 

and lookee here </s>
<s>  wotever i done is worked out and paid for he
insisted again </s>
<s> 

so be it </s>
<s> 

he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead
when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think
it might perplex the thread of his narrative </s>
<s>  he put it back again
stuck his pipe in a buttonhole of his coat spread a hand on each knee
and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments
looked round at us and said what follows </s>

not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i donewhich ˜ud

that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave </s>

there aint no need to go into it he said looking round once more </s>

the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i
noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him </s>

evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had
come forard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money
had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing

plainer </s>

suchlike </s>

he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked

he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his
face and head and neck and hands before he could go on </s>

i had said to compeyson that id smash that face of his and i swore

chapter xliii

why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be
traced to estella </s>
<s>  why should i loiter on my road to compare the state
of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her at the coachoffice with the state of mind in which
i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty
and the returned transport whom i harbored </s>
<s>  the road would be none the
smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not
be helped nor i extenuated </s>
<s> 

a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative </s>
<s>  or rather
his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there </s>
<s>  if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could
hardly doubt the consequence </s>
<s>  that compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him neither of the two could know much better than i </s>
<s>  and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined </s>
<s> 

never had i breathed and never would i breatheor so i resolveda
word of estella to provis </s>
<s>  but i said to herbert that before i could
go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham </s>
<s>  this was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story </s>
<s>  i
resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went </s>
<s> 

on my presenting myself at <abvr> brandleys estellas maid was called to
tell that estella had gone into the country </s>
<s>  where </s>
<s>  to satis house as
usual </s>
<s>  not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without
me </s>
<s>  when was she coming back </s>
<s>  there was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid
believed she was only coming back at all for a little while </s>
<s>  i could
make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make
nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture </s>
<s> 

another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i
always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came
back from miss havishams </s>
<s>  in the mean time herbert and i were to
consider separately what it would be best to say </s>
<s>  whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
observation </s>
<s>  or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose
an expedition </s>
<s>  we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he
would consent </s>
<s>  we agreed that his remaining many days in his present
hazard was not to be thought of </s>
<s> 

next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise
to go down to joe </s>
<s>  but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe
or his name </s>
<s>  provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and
herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken </s>
<s>  i was to be
absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun </s>
<s>  it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to
herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that
pretenceas to make purchases or the like </s>
<s> 

having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havishams i set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and
whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist like a beggar </s>
<s>  when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly
ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand
to look at the coach but bentley drummle </s>
<s> 

as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him </s>
<s>  it was a very
lame pretence on both sides </s>
<s>  the lamer because we both went into the
coffeeroom where he had just finished his breakfast and where i
ordered mine </s>
<s>  it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very
well knew why he had come there </s>
<s> 

pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had
nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of
coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire </s>
<s>  by
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
fire </s>
<s>  and i got up determined to have my share of it </s>
<s>  i had to put my
hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire but still pretended not to know him </s>
<s> 

is this a cut </s>
<s>  said <abvr> drummle </s>
<s> 

oh </s>
<s>  said i poker in hand </s>
<s>  its you is it </s>
<s>  how do you do </s>
<s>  i was
wondering who it was who kept the fire off </s>
<s> 

with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side
by side with <abvr> drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire </s>
<s> 

you have just come down </s>
<s>  said <abvr> drummle edging me a little away
with his shoulder </s>
<s> 

yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder </s>
<s> 

beastly place said drummle </s>
<s>  your part of the country i think </s>
<s> 

yes i assented </s>
<s>  i am told its very like your shropshire </s>
<s> 

not in the least like it said drummle </s>
<s> 

here <abvr> drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then <abvr>
drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his </s>
<s> 

have you been here long </s>
<s>  i asked determined not to yield an inch of
the fire </s>
<s> 

long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn
but equally determined </s>
<s> 

do you stay here long </s>
<s> 

cant say answered <abvr> drummle </s>
<s>  do you </s>
<s> 

cant say said i </s>
<s> 

i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if <abvr> drummles
shoulder had claimed another hairs breadth of room i should have
jerked him into the window </s>
<s>  equally that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim <abvr> drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box </s>
<s>  he
whistled a little </s>
<s>  so did i </s>
<s> 

large tract of marshes about here i believe </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  what of that </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh </s>
<s>  and
laughed </s>
<s> 

are you amused <abvr> drummle </s>
<s> 

no said he not particularly </s>
<s>  i am going out for a ride in the
saddle </s>
<s>  i mean to explore those marshes for amusement </s>

very good sir </s>

and i dont dine because im going to dine at the ladys </s>
<s> 

very good sir </s>
<s> 

then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his
greatjowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so
exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the
robber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat
him on the fire </s>
<s> 

one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief
came neither of us could relinquish the fire </s>
<s>  there we stood well
squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our
hands behind us not budging an inch </s>
<s>  the horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummles
was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both
stood our ground </s>
<s> 

have you been to the grove since </s>
<s>  said drummle </s>
<s> 

no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was
there </s>
<s> 

was that when we had a difference of opinion </s>
<s> 

yes i replied very shortly </s>
<s> 

come come </s>
<s>  they let you off easily enough sneered drummle </s>
<s>  you
shouldnt have lost your temper </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that
subject </s>
<s>  when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that
occasion i dont throw glasses </s>
<s> 

i do said drummle </s>
<s> 

after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity i said

mr </s>
<s>  drummle i did not seek this conversation and i dont think it an
agreeable one </s>
<s> 

i am sure its not said he superciliously over his shoulder </s>
<s>  i
dont think anything about it </s>
<s> 

and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future </s>
<s> 

quite my opinion said drummle and what i should have suggested
myself or donemore likelywithout suggesting </s>
<s>  but dont lose your
temper </s>
<s>  havent you lost enough without that </s>
<s> 

what do you mean sir </s>
<s> 

waiter </s>
<s>  said drummle by way of answering me </s>
<s> 

the waiter reappeared </s>
<s> 

look here you sir </s>
<s>  you quite understand that the young lady dont ride
today and that i dine at the young ladys </s>
<s> 

quite so sir </s>
<s> 

when the waiter had felt my fastcooling teapot with the palm of his
hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle
careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket
and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring </s>
<s>  choking and
boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without
introducing estellas name which i could not endure to hear him utter </s>
<s> 
and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were
no one present and forced myself to silence </s>
<s>  how long we might have
remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but
for the incursion of three thriving farmerslaid on by the waiter i
thinkwho came into the coffeeroom unbuttoning their greatcoats and
rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we
were obliged to give way </s>
<s> 

i saw him through the window seizing his horses mane and mounting in
his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away </s>
<s>  i thought
he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his
mouth which he had forgotten </s>
<s>  a man in a dustcolored dress appeared
with what was wantedi could not have said from where </s>
<s>  whether from
the inn yard or the street or where notand as drummle leaned down
from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his
head towards the coffeeroom windows the slouching shoulders and ragged
hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of orlick </s>
<s> 

too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or
no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the
journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house
that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered
never to have seen </s>

chapter xliv

in the room where the dressingtable stood and where the waxcandles
burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella </s>
<s>  miss havisham
seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet </s>

estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on </s>

their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me </s>
<s>  i derived
that from the look they interchanged </s>
<s> 

and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip </s>
<s> 

though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused </s>
<s> 
estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and
then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as
plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i
had discovered my real benefactor </s>
<s> 

miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to
estella </s>
<s>  and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed </s>
<s> 

miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down
i took the chair by the dressingtable which i had often seen her
occupy </s>

<s> 

miss havisham continued to look steadily at me </s>

action of estellas fingers as they worked that she attended to what i
said </s>

<s> 

i have found out who my patron is </s>

and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune
anything </s>

as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to
go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but anothers </s>

when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i
belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left

for it </s>

i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham
and have been constantly among them since i went to london </s>

to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself </s>

false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or
no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you
deeply wrong both <abvr> matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of
anything designing or mean </s>
<s> 

they are your friends said miss havisham </s>

they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me
to have superseded them </s>

mistress camilla were not my friends i think </s>

this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do
them good with her </s>

said quietly

what do you want for them </s>

only said i that you would not confound them with the others </s>
<s>  they
may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same
nature </s>
<s> 

still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated

what do you want for them </s>
<s> 

i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i
reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired
that i do want something </s>
<s>  miss havisham if you would spare the money
to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you
how </s>
<s> 

why must it be done without his knowledge </s>
<s>  she asked settling her
hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively </s>
<s> 

because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago
without his knowledge and i dont want to be betrayed </s>

ability to finish it i cannot explain </s>

she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire </s>
<s> 
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me againat
first vacantlythen with a gradually concentrating attention </s>

this time estella knitted on </s>
<s>  when miss havisham had fixed her
attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue

what else </s>
<s> 

estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my
trembling voice you know i love you </s>
<s>  you know that i have loved you
long and dearly </s>
<s> 

she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers
plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance </s>
<s>  i
saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me </s>
<s> 

i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake </s>
<s>  it induced me
to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another </s>
<s>  while i thought you
could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it </s>
<s>  but i
must say it now </s>
<s> 

preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going
estella shook her head </s>
<s> 

i know said i in answer to that actioni know </s>

that i shall ever call you mine estella </s>
<s>  i am ignorant what may become
of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go </s>
<s>  still i love
you </s>
<s>  i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house </s>
<s> 

looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her
head again </s>
<s> 

it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the
gravity of what she did </s>
<s>  but i think she did not </s>
<s>  i think that in the
endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella </s>
<s> 

i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she
sat looking by turns at estella and at me </s>
<s> 

it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments
fanciesi dont know how to call themwhich i am not able to
comprehend </s>

of words </s>

nothing there </s>

yes </s>

i thought and hoped you could not mean it </s>

beautiful estella </s>
<s>  surely it is not in nature </s>

it is in my nature she returned </s>

upon the words it is in the nature formed within me </s>
<s>  i make a great
difference between you and all other people when i say so much </s>

no more </s>
<s> 

is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and
pursuing you </s>
<s> 

it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference
of utter contempt </s>
<s> 

that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with
you this very day </s>
<s> 

she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied
quite true </s>
<s> 

you cannot love him estella </s>
<s> 

her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily
what have i told you </s>
<s>  do you still think in spite of it that i do not
mean what i say </s>
<s> 

you would never marry him estella </s>
<s> 

she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands </s>
<s>  then she said why not tell you the truth </s>
<s>  i am
going to be married to him </s>
<s> 

i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better
than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear
her say those words </s>
<s>  when i raised my face again there was such a
ghastly look upon miss havishams that it impressed me even in my
passionate hurry and grief </s>
<s> 

estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this
fatal step </s>
<s>  put me aside for everyou have done so i well knowbut
bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle </s>

gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done

love you </s>
<s>  among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly

better for your sake </s>
<s> 

my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her own mind </s>
<s> 

i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to
him </s>
<s>  the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be
married soon </s>

adoption </s>

your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute </s>

done </s>

in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i
dont know </s>
<s>  the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an
inward wound and gushed out </s>
<s>  i held her hand to my lips some lingering
moments and so i left her </s>
<s>  but ever afterwards i rememberedand soon
afterwards with stronger reasonthat while estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand
still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse </s>
<s> 

all done all gone </s>
<s>  so much was done and gone that when i went out at
the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when i went
in </s>
<s>  for a while i hid myself among some lanes and bypaths and then
struck off to walk all the way to london </s>
<s>  for i had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and
see drummle there </s>
<s>  that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to </s>
<s>  that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out </s>
<s> 

it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge </s>
<s>  pursuing the narrow
intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was
close by the riverside through whitefriars </s>

tomorrow </s>

get to bed myself without disturbing him </s>
<s> 

as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the
temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it
ill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in </s>
<s>  to help his memory i mentioned
my name </s>

i was not quite sure sir but i thought so </s>

messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my
lantern </s>
<s> 

much surprised by the request i took the note </s>

words please read this here </s>

his light and read inside in wemmicks writing

chapter xlv

turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made
the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the hummums in covent garden </s>
<s>  in those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain
letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on
his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his
list </s>
<s>  it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a
despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it straddling over the
whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little
washingstand in quite a divinely righteous manner </s>
<s> 

as i had asked for a nightlight the chamberlain had brought me in
before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous daysan object like the ghost of a walkingcane which
instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be
lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wideawake pattern on the walls </s>
<s>  when i had got into bed and lay there
footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own
eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus </s>
<s>  and thus in the
gloom and death of the night we stared at one another </s>
<s> 

what a doleful night </s>
<s>  how anxious how dismal how long </s>
<s>  there was an
inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust </s>
<s>  and as i
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what
a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the
market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying
by for next summer </s>
<s>  this led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my facea
disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back </s>
<s>  when i had lain awake a little while those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible </s>
<s>  the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little
washingstand ticked and one guitarstring played occasionally in the
chest of drawers </s>
<s>  at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw
written dont go home </s>
<s> 

whatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me they never warded
off this dont go home </s>
<s>  it plaited itself into whatever i thought of
as a bodily pain would have done </s>
<s>  not long before i had read in the
newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the
night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood </s>
<s>  it came into my head that he
must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about </s>
<s>  then opened the door
to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing </s>
<s>  but
all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home
and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were
questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme </s>
<s>  even when i
thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when
i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and
tones and the action of her fingers while she knittedeven then i
was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution dont go home </s>
<s> 
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became
a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate </s>
<s>  imperative mood present
tense </s>
<s>  do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do
not ye or you go home let not them go home </s>
<s>  then potentially </s>
<s>  i may not
and i cannot go home </s>
<s>  and i might not could not would not and should
not go home </s>
<s>  until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over
on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again </s>
<s> 

i had left directions that i was to be called at seven </s>
<s>  for it was plain
that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain
that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be
taken </s>
<s>  it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed </s>
<s> 

the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oclock </s>
<s>  the little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company
and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was
making tea for himself and the aged </s>
<s>  an open door afforded a perspective
view of the aged in bed </s>
<s> 

halloa <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  you did come home then </s>
<s> 

yes i returned </s>
<s>  but i didnt go home </s>
<s> 

thats all right said he rubbing his hands </s>
<s>  i left a note for you
at each of the temple gates on the chance </s>
<s>  which gate did you come to </s>
<s> 

i told him </s>
<s> 

ill go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes said wemmick </s>
<s>  its a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it because you dont know when it may be put
in </s>
<s>  im going to take a liberty with you </s>
<s>  would you mind toasting this
sausage for the aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 

i said i should be delighted to do it </s>
<s> 

then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little
servant </s>
<s>  which leaves us to ourselves dont you see <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  he
added winking as she disappeared </s>
<s> 

i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the ageds sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the ageds roll </s>
<s> 

now <abvr> pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one
another </s>
<s>  we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before today </s>
<s>  official sentiments
are one thing </s>
<s>  we are extra official </s>
<s> 

i cordially assented </s>
<s>  i was so very nervous that i had already lighted
the ageds sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out </s>
<s> 

i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a
certain place where i once took youeven between you and me its as
well not to mention names when avoidable

much better not said i </s>
<s>  i understand you </s>
<s> 

i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not
unpossessed of portable propertyi dont know who it may really
bewe wont name this person

not necessary said i </s>
<s> 

had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations
and not quite irrespective of the government expense

in watching his face i made quite a firework of the ageds sausage
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmicks </s>
<s>  for which i
apologized </s>
<s> 

by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of
thereabouts </s>
<s>  from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and
theories formed </s>
<s>  i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court
temple had been watched and might be watched again </s>
<s> 

by whom </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

i wouldnt go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with
official responsibilities </s>
<s>  i heard it as i have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place </s>
<s>  i dont tell it you on information
received </s>
<s>  i heard it </s>
<s> 

he took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth
the ageds breakfast neatly on a little tray </s>
<s>  previous to placing it
before him he went into the ageds room with a clean white cloth and
tied the same under the old gentlemans chin and propped him up and
put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air </s>
<s>  then he
placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right
aint you aged p </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  to which the cheerful aged replied all right
john my boy all right </s>
<s>  as there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be
considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings </s>
<s> 

this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to
suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted </s>
<s>  is it </s>
<s> 

wemmick looked very serious </s>
<s>  i couldnt undertake to say that of my
own knowledge </s>
<s>  i mean i couldnt undertake to say it was at first </s>
<s>  but
it either is or it will be or its in great danger of being </s>
<s> 

as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying
as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him </s>
<s>  but i told
him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask
him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he
deemed right and sure that his course would be right </s>
<s>  he paused in his
breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirtsleeves his
notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me
once to put my question </s>
<s> 

you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is
compeyson </s>
<s> 

he answered with one other nod </s>
<s> 

is he living </s>
<s> 

one other nod </s>
<s> 

is he in london </s>
<s> 

he gave me one other nod compressed the postoffice exceedingly gave
me one last nod and went on with his breakfast </s>
<s> 

now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasized and
repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i
heard </s>
<s>  i went to garden court to find you </s>
<s>  not finding you i went to
clarrikers to find <abvr> herbert </s>
<s> 

and him you found </s>
<s>  said i with great anxiety </s>
<s> 

and him i found </s>
<s>  without mentioning any names or going into any
details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodytom
jack or richardbeing about the chambers or about the immediate
neighborhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way
while you were out of the way </s>
<s> 

he would be greatly puzzled what to do </s>
<s> 

he was puzzled what to do </s>
<s>  not the less because i gave him my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out
of the way at present </s>
<s>  <abvr> pip ill tell you something </s>
<s>  under existing
circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it </s>
<s>  dont break cover too soon </s>
<s>  lie close </s>
<s>  wait till things slacken
before you try the open even for foreign air </s>
<s> 

i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had
done </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an
hour struck out a plan </s>
<s>  he mentioned to me as a secret that he is
courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden
pa </s>
<s>  which pa having been in the purser line of life lies abed in a
bowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river </s>
<s>  you
are acquainted with the young lady most probably </s>
<s> 

not personally said i </s>
<s> 

the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to
present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made
her acquaintance </s>
<s>  when i had begun to advance herberts prospects by
stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy </s>
<s>  he and
his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews </s>
<s>  and thus although i was
assured that i had risen in claras esteem and although the young
lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
herbert i had never seen her </s>
<s>  however i did not trouble wemmick with
these particulars </s>
<s> 

the house with the bowwindow said wemmick being by the riverside
down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it
seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let <abvr> herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary
tenement for tom jack or richard </s>
<s>  now i thought very well of it for
three reasons ill give you </s>
<s>  that is to say </s>
<s>  firstly </s>
<s>  its altogether
out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small </s>
<s>  secondly </s>
<s>  without going near it yourself you could
always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through <abvr> herbert </s>
<s> 
thirdly </s>
<s>  after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want
to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packetboat there he
isready </s>
<s> 

much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and
again and begged him to proceed </s>
<s> 

well sir </s>
<s>  <abvr> herbert threw himself into the business with a will and
by nine oclock last night he housed tom jack or richardwhichever
it may beyou and i dont want to knowquite successfully </s>
<s>  at the
old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in
fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it </s>
<s>  now
another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you
and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged </s>
<s> 
this diverts suspicion and confuses it </s>
<s>  and for the same reason i
recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go
home </s>
<s>  it brings in more confusion and you want confusion </s>
<s> 

wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and
began to get his coat on </s>
<s> 

and now <abvr> pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i
have probably done the most i can do </s>
<s>  but if i can ever do morefrom
a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal
capacityi shall be glad to do it </s>
<s>  heres the address </s>
<s>  there can be
no harm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is
well with tom jack or richard before you go homewhich is another
reason for your not going home last night </s>
<s>  but after you have gone
home dont go back here </s>
<s>  you are very welcome i am sure <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  his
hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them </s>
<s>  and let me
finally impress one important point upon you </s>
<s>  he laid his hands upon
my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper </s>
<s>  avail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his portable property </s>
<s>  you dont know what may
happen to him </s>
<s>  dont let anything happen to the portable property </s>
<s> 

quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i
forbore to try </s>
<s> 

times up said wemmick and i must be off </s>
<s>  if you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark thats what i should advise </s>
<s> 
you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the agedhell be up presentlyand a little bit
ofyou remember the pig </s>
<s> 

of course said i </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  and a little bit of him </s>
<s>  that sausage you toasted was his and
he was in all respects a firstrater </s>
<s>  do try him if it is only for old
acquaintance sake </s>
<s>  goodbye aged parent </s>
<s>  in a cheery shout </s>
<s> 

all right john </s>
<s>  all right my boy </s>
<s>  piped the old man from within </s>
<s> 

i soon fell asleep before wemmicks fire and the aged and i enjoyed one
anothers society by falling asleep before it more or less all day </s>
<s> 
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate </s>
<s>  and
i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it
drowsily </s>
<s>  when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for

chapter xlvi

eight oclock had struck before i got into the air that was scented
not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the longshore
boatbuilders and mast oar and block makers </s>
<s>  all that waterside
region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to
me </s>
<s>  and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted
was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to
find </s>
<s>  it was called mill pond bank chinkss basin </s>
<s>  and i had no other
guide to chinkss basin than the old green copper ropewalk </s>
<s> 

it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself
among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of shipbuilders
and shipbreakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground
though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber how many ropewalks that were not the old green copper </s>
<s>  after
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank </s>
<s>  it was a
fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round </s>
<s>  and there were two or three
trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there
was the old green copper ropewalkwhose long and narrow vista i could
trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground that looked like superannuated haymakingrakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth </s>
<s> 

selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow which is
another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there
mrs </s>
<s>  whimple </s>
<s>  that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded </s>
<s>  she was
immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door </s>
<s>  it was an odd sensation to see his very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region </s>
<s>  and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at
the cornercupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the
chimneypiece and the colored engravings on the wall representing the
death of captain cook a shiplaunch and his majesty king george the
third in a state coachmans wig leatherbreeches and topboots on the
terrace at windsor </s>
<s> 

all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though
eager to see you </s>
<s>  my dear girl is with her father </s>
<s>  and if youll wait
till she comes down ill make you known to her and then well go upstairs </s>
<s> 
thats her father </s>
<s> 

i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance </s>
<s> 

i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have
never seen him </s>
<s>  dont you smell rum </s>
<s>  he is always at it </s>
<s> 

at rum </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his
gout </s>
<s>  he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his
room and serving them out </s>
<s>  he keeps them on shelves over his head and
will weigh them all </s>
<s>  his room must be like a chandlers shop </s>
<s> 

while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and
then died away </s>
<s> 

what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if
he will cut the cheese </s>
<s>  a man with the gout in his right handand
everywhere elsecant expect to get through a double gloucester without
hurting himself </s>
<s> 

he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious
roar </s>
<s> 

to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to <abvr> whimple
 said herbert for of course people in general wont stand that noise </s>
<s>  a
curious place handel </s>
<s>  isnt it </s>
<s> 

it was a curious place indeed </s>
<s>  but remarkably well kept and clean </s>
<s> 

mrs </s>
<s>  whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of
housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without
her motherly help </s>
<s>  for clara has no mother of her own handel and no
relation in the world but old gruffandgrim </s>
<s> 

surely thats not his name herbert </s>
<s> 

no no said herbert thats my name for him </s>
<s>  his name is <abvr> barley </s>
<s> 
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her family </s>
<s> 

herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he
first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at
an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home
to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the
motherly <abvr> whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion ever since </s>
<s>  it was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by
reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than gout rum and pursers stores </s>
<s> 

as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barleys sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door
opened and a very pretty slight darkeyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her hand </s>
<s>  whom herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket and presented blushing as clara </s>
<s>  she really was a most
charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that
truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service </s>
<s> 

look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate
and tender smile after we had talked a little </s>
<s>  heres poor claras
supper served out every night </s>
<s>  heres her allowance of bread and
heres her slice of cheese and heres her rumwhich i drink </s>
<s>  this
is <abvr> barleys breakfast for tomorrow served out to be cooked </s>
<s>  two
muttonchops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two
ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper </s>
<s>  its
stewed up together and taken hot and its a nice thing for the gout i
should think </s>
<s> 

there was something so natural and winning in claras resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out </s>
<s>  and
something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of
yielding herself to herberts embracing arm </s>
<s>  and something so gentle in
her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinkss basin
and the old green copper ropewalk with old barley growling in the
beamthat i would not have undone the engagement between her and
herbert for all the money in the pocketbook i had never opened </s>
<s> 

i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us </s>
<s>  upon this clara said to herbert papa wants
me darling </s>
<s>  and ran away </s>
<s> 

there is an unconscionable old shark for you </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  what do
you suppose he wants now handel </s>
<s> 

i dont know said i </s>
<s>  something to drink </s>
<s> 

thats it </s>
<s>  cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary
merit </s>
<s>  he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table </s>
<s> 
wait a moment and youll hear clara lift him up to take some </s>
<s>  there
he goes </s>
<s>  another roar with a prolonged shake at the end </s>
<s>  now said
herbert as it was succeeded by silence hes drinking </s>
<s>  now said
herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more hes down again
on his back </s>
<s> 

clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to
see our charge </s>
<s>  as we passed <abvr> barleys door he was heard hoarsely
muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the
following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse </s>
<s> 

ahoy </s>
<s>  bless your eyes heres old bill barley </s>
<s>  heres old bill barley
bless your eyes </s>
<s>  heres old bill barley on the flat of his back by the
lord </s>
<s>  lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder
heres your old bill barley bless your eyes </s>
<s>  ahoy </s>
<s>  bless you </s>
<s> 

in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together </s>
<s>  often while
it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river </s>
<s> 

in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and
airy and in which <abvr> barley was less audible than below i found
provis comfortably settled </s>
<s>  he expressed no alarm and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning </s>
<s>  but it struck me that he was
softenedindefinably for i could not have said how and could never
afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly </s>
<s> 

the opportunity that the days rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting
compeyson </s>
<s>  for anything i knew his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction </s>
<s>  therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his
fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmicks judgment
and sources of information </s>
<s> 

ay ay dear boy </s>
<s>  he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows </s>
<s> 

then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you
what caution he gave me and what advice </s>
<s> 

this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned </s>
<s>  and i told
him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or
prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that
my chambers had been watched </s>
<s>  how wemmick had recommended his keeping
close for a time and my keeping away from him </s>
<s>  and what wemmick had
said about getting him abroad </s>
<s>  i added that of course when the time
came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might
be safest in wemmicks judgment </s>
<s>  what was to follow that i did not touch
upon </s>
<s>  neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared
peril for my sake </s>
<s>  as to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse </s>
<s> 

he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout </s>
<s>  his
coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a
venture </s>
<s>  he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had
very little fear of his safety with such good help </s>
<s> 

herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmicks
suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue </s>
<s>  we are both good
watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the
right time comes </s>
<s>  no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no
boatmen </s>
<s>  that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance
is worth saving </s>
<s>  never mind the season </s>
<s>  dont you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river </s>
<s>  you fall into that
habit and then who notices or minds </s>
<s>  do it twenty or fifty times
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twentyfirst or
fiftyfirst </s>
<s> 

i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it </s>
<s>  we agreed
that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never
recognize us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank </s>
<s>  but
we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his
window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right </s>
<s> 

our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go </s>
<s> 
remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and
that i would take half an hours start of him </s>
<s>  i dont like to leave
you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me </s>
<s>  goodbye </s>
<s> 

dear boy he answered clasping my hands i dont know when we may
meet again and i dont like goodbye </s>
<s>  say good night </s>
<s> 

good night </s>
<s>  herbert will go regularly between us and when the time
comes you may be certain i shall be ready </s>
<s>  good night good night </s>
<s> 

we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms </s>
<s>  and we left him
on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stairrail to
light us downstairs </s>
<s>  looking back at him i thought of the first night
of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him
as it was now </s>
<s> 

old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease </s>
<s>  when we got to the
foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of
provis </s>
<s>  he replied certainly not and that the lodger was <abvr> campbell </s>
<s> 
he also explained that the utmost known of <abvr> campbell there was
that he herbert had <abvr> campbell consigned to him and felt a strong
personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded
life </s>
<s>  so when we went into the parlor where <abvr> whimple and clara were
seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in <abvr> campbell but
kept it to myself </s>
<s> 

when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle darkeyed girl and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk had
grown quite a different place </s>
<s>  old barley might be as old as the hills
and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in chinkss basin to fill it to
overflowing </s>
<s>  and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went
home very sadly </s>
<s> 

all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them </s>
<s>  the
windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark
and still and there was no lounger in garden court </s>
<s>  i walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms but i was quite alone </s>
<s>  herbert coming to my
bedside when he came infor i went straight to bed dispirited and
fatiguedmade the same report </s>
<s>  opening one of the windows after that
he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour </s>
<s> 

next day i set myself to get the boat </s>
<s>  it was soon done and the boat
was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach
her within a minute or two </s>
<s>  then i began to go out as for training and
practice </s>
<s>  sometimes alone sometimes with herbert </s>
<s>  i was often out in
cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been
out a few times </s>
<s>  at first i kept above blackfriars bridge </s>
<s>  but as the
hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge </s>
<s>  it was old
london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation </s>
<s>  but i
knew well enough how to ˜shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so
began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith </s>
<s> 
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a
pair of oars </s>
<s>  and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards
the east come down </s>
<s>  herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming </s>
<s>  still i knew that there was cause for alarm
and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched </s>
<s>  once received
it is a haunting idea </s>
<s>  how many undesigning persons i suspected of
watching me it would be hard to calculate </s>
<s> 

in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding </s>
<s> 
herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to
think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara </s>
<s>  but
i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly
silently and surely to take him </s>
<s> 




chapter xlvii

some weeks passed without bringing any change </s>
<s>  we waited for wemmick
and he made no sign </s>
<s>  if i had never known him out of little britain and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
castle i might have doubted him </s>
<s>  not so for a moment knowing him as i
did </s>
<s> 

my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed
for money by more than one creditor </s>
<s>  even i myself began to know the
want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash </s>
<s>  but
i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans </s>
<s>  therefore i had sent him the unopened pocketbook by herbert to
hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it
was a false kind or a true i hardly knowin not having profited by his
generosity since his revelation of himself </s>
<s> 

as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella
was married </s>
<s>  fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a
conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had
confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her
to me </s>
<s>  why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know </s>
<s>  why did you
who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year last month last week </s>
<s> 

it was an unhappy life that i lived </s>
<s>  and its one dominant anxiety
towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a
range of mountains never disappeared from my view </s>
<s>  still no new cause
for fear arose </s>
<s>  let me start from my bed as i would with the terror
fresh upon me that he was discovered </s>
<s>  let me sit listening as i would
with dread for herberts returning step at night lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil newsfor all that and
much more to like purpose the round of things went on </s>
<s>  condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed
about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could </s>
<s> 

there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could
not get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old london
bridge </s>
<s>  then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be
brought up afterwards to the temple stairs </s>
<s>  i was not averse to doing
this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
waterside people there </s>
<s>  from this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that i have now to tell of </s>
<s> 

one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf
at dusk </s>
<s>  i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and
had turned with the tide </s>
<s>  it had been a fine bright day but had become
foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the
shipping pretty carefully </s>
<s>  both in going and returning i had seen the
signal in his window all well </s>
<s> 

as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort
myself with dinner at once </s>
<s>  and as i had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go
to the play </s>
<s>  the theatre where <abvr> wopsle had achieved his questionable
triumph was in that waterside neighborhood it is nowhere now and
to that theatre i resolved to go </s>
<s>  i was aware that <abvr> wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather
partaken of its decline </s>
<s>  he had been ominously heard of through the
playbills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of
noble birth and a monkey </s>
<s>  and herbert had seen him as a predatory
tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an
outrageous hat all over bells </s>
<s> 

i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chophouse
where there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every halfyard
of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knivesto
this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the lord mayors
dominions which is not geographicaland wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners </s>
<s>  by
and by i roused myself and went to the play </s>
<s> 

there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majestys servicea most
excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so
tight in some places and not quite so loose in otherswho knocked all
the little mens hats over their eyes though he was very generous and
brave and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes though he was
very patriotic </s>
<s>  he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in
the cloth and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture
with great rejoicings </s>

number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody elses and sing fill fill </s>
<s>  a certain
darkcomplexioned swab however who wouldnt fill or do anything else
that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the
boatswain to be as black as his figurehead proposed to two other
swabs to get all mankind into difficulties </s>
<s>  which was so effectually
done the swab family having considerable political influence that it
took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters
and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and
coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard </s>
<s>  this led to <abvr>
wopsles who had never been heard of before coming in with a star
and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot
and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight
acknowledgment of his public services </s>
<s>  the boatswain unmanned for the
first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering
up and addressing <abvr> wopsle as your honor solicited permission to
take him by the fin </s>
<s>  <abvr> wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious
dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody
danced a hornpipe </s>
<s>  and from that corner surveying the public with a
discontented eye became aware of me </s>

countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great
cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner </s>

surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were
lost in amazement </s>
<s> 

there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of <abvr>
wopsles eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out </s>
<s>  i sat
thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
watchcase and still i could not make it out </s>
<s>  i was still thinking
of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him
waiting for me near the door </s>

having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected

therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing </s>

i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you <abvr> pip till i saw
that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a
ghost </s>
<s> 

my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak
yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with provis </s>
<s>  of course i was
perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there </s>

<s>  better than he thoughtexcept the last

there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other </s>

and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre

outer ring of dark night all about us </s>

him </s>

known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time </s>

he dressed </s>
<s>  prosperously but not noticeably otherwise </s>
<s>  he thought in
black </s>

<s>  no he believed not </s>
<s>  i believed
not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention </s>

when <abvr> wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i
extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment
after the fatigues of the evening we parted </s>

one oclock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut </s>

was near me when i went in and went home </s>

herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire </s>
<s>  but
there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i
had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint </s>
<s> 
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the
castle i made this communication by letter </s>

bed and went out and posted it </s>

<s>  herbert
and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious </s>

we were very cautious indeedmore cautious than before if that were
possibleand i for my part never went near chinkss basin except

chapter xlviii

the second of the two meetings referred to in the last </s>
<s> occurred
about a week after the first </s>
<s>  i had again left my boat at the wharf
below bridge </s>
<s>  the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon </s>
<s>  and
undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was
strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me </s>
<s>  it was <abvr> jaggerss hand and he passed it through my
arm </s>
<s> 

as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together </s>
<s>  where
are you bound for </s>
<s> 

for the temple i think said i </s>
<s> 

dont you know </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in
crossexamination i do not know for i have not made up my mind </s>
<s> 

you are going to dine </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  you dont mind admitting
that i suppose </s>
<s> 

no i returned i dont mind admitting that </s>
<s> 

and are not engaged </s>
<s> 

i dont mind admitting also that i am not engaged </s>
<s> 

then said <abvr> jaggers come and dine with me </s>
<s> 

i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmicks coming </s>
<s>  so
i changed my excuse into an acceptancethe few words i had uttered
serving for the beginning of eitherand we went along cheapside
and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamplighters scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoons bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall </s>
<s> 

at the office in little britain there was the usual letterwriting
handwashing candlesnuffing and safelocking that closed the
business of the day </s>
<s>  as i stood idle by <abvr> jaggerss fire its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bopeep with me </s>
<s>  while the pair of coarse
fat office candles that dimly lighted <abvr> jaggers as he wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty windingsheets as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients </s>
<s> 

we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackneycoach </s>
<s>  and
as soon as we got there dinner was served </s>
<s>  although i should not have
thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much
as a look to wemmicks walworth sentiments yet i should have had no
objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way </s>
<s>  but it
was not to be done </s>
<s>  he turned his eyes on <abvr> jaggers whenever he raised
them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one </s>
<s> 

did you send that note of miss havishams to <abvr> pip wemmick </s>
<s>  <abvr>
jaggers asked soon after we began dinner </s>
<s> 

no sir returned wemmick </s>
<s>  it was going by post when you brought <abvr>
pip into the office </s>
<s>  here it is </s>
<s>  he handed it to his principal instead
of to me </s>
<s> 

its a note of two lines pip said <abvr> jaggers handing it on sent
up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address </s>
<s>  she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her </s>
<s>  youll go down </s>
<s> 

yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those
terms </s>
<s> 

when do you think of going down </s>
<s> 

i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was
putting fish into the postoffice that renders me rather uncertain of
my time </s>
<s>  at once i think </s>
<s> 

if <abvr> pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to <abvr>
jaggers he neednt write an answer you know </s>
<s> 

receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled
that i would go tomorrow and said so </s>
<s>  wemmick drank a glass of wine
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at <abvr> jaggers but not at me </s>
<s> 

so pip </s>
<s>  our friend the spider said <abvr> jaggers has played his
cards </s>
<s>  he has won the pool </s>
<s> 

it was as much as i could do to assent </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  he is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all
his own way </s>
<s>  the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to
be found out first </s>
<s>  if he should turn to and beat her

surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i didnt say so pip </s>
<s>  i am putting a case </s>
<s>  if he should turn to and
beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side </s>
<s>  if it should be
a question of intellect he certainly will not </s>
<s>  it would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances because its a tossup between two results </s>
<s> 

may i ask what they are </s>
<s> 

a fellow like our friend the spider answered <abvr> jaggers either
beats or cringes </s>
<s>  he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl </s>
<s>  but
he either beats or cringes </s>
<s>  ask wemmick his opinion </s>
<s> 

either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself
to me </s>
<s> 

so heres to <abvr> bentley drummle said <abvr> jaggers taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter and filling for each of us and
for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the ladys
satisfaction </s>
<s>  to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman
it never will be </s>
<s>  now molly molly molly molly how slow you are
today </s>
<s> 

she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the
table </s>
<s>  as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two
nervously muttering some excuse </s>
<s>  and a certain action of her fingers as
she spoke arrested my attention </s>
<s> 

whats the matter </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather
painful to me </s>
<s> 

the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting </s>
<s>  she stood
looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or
whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go </s>
<s> 
her look was very intent </s>
<s>  surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately </s>
<s> 

he dismissed her and she glided out of the room </s>
<s>  but she remained
before me as plainly as if she were still there </s>
<s>  i looked at those
hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair </s>
<s>  and i
compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life </s>
<s>  i looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when i last walkednot alonein the ruined garden and through the
deserted brewery </s>
<s>  i thought how the same feeling had come back when i
saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach
window </s>
<s>  and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning when i had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden
glare of light in a dark street </s>
<s>  i thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link
wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a
chance swift from estellas name to the fingers with their knitting
action and the attentive eyes </s>
<s>  and i felt absolutely certain that this
woman was estellas mother </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal </s>
<s>  he nodded when i said
the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the
wine again and went on with his dinner </s>
<s> 

only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the
room was very short and <abvr> jaggers was sharp with her </s>
<s>  but her hands
were estellas hands and her eyes were estellas eyes and if she had
reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth </s>
<s> 

it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round
quite as a matter of businessjust as he might have drawn his salary
when that came roundand with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for crossexamination </s>
<s>  as to the quantity of wine
his postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice
for its quantity of letters </s>
<s>  from my point of view he was the wrong
twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth </s>
<s> 

we took our leave early and left together </s>
<s>  even when we were groping
among <abvr> jaggerss stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right
twin was on his way back </s>
<s>  and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was
walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  said wemmick thats over </s>
<s>  hes a wonderful man without his
living likeness </s>
<s>  but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine
with himand i dine more comfortably unscrewed </s>
<s> 

i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so </s>
<s> 

wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself he answered </s>
<s>  i know that
what is said between you and me goes no further </s>
<s> 

i asked him if he had ever seen miss havishams adopted daughter <abvr>
bentley drummle </s>
<s>  he said no </s>
<s>  to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke
of the aged and of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  he looked rather sly when i mentioned
miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll
of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness </s>
<s> 

wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to
mr </s>
<s>  jaggerss private house to notice that housekeeper </s>
<s> 

did i </s>
<s>  he replied </s>
<s>  ah i dare say i did </s>
<s>  deuce take me he added
suddenly i know i did </s>
<s>  i find i am not quite unscrewed yet </s>
<s> 

a wild beast tamed you called her </s>
<s> 

and what do you call her </s>
<s> 

the same </s>
<s>  how did <abvr> jaggers tame her wemmick </s>
<s> 

thats his secret </s>
<s>  she has been with him many a long year </s>
<s> 

i wish you would tell me her story </s>
<s>  i feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it </s>
<s>  you know that what is said between you and me
goes no further </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  wemmick replied i dont know her storythat is i dont know
all of it </s>
<s>  but what i do know ill tell you </s>
<s>  we are in our private and
personal capacities of course </s>
<s> 

of course </s>
<s> 

a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for
murder and was acquitted </s>
<s>  she was a very handsome young woman and i
believe had some gypsy blood in her </s>
<s>  anyhow it was hot enough when it
was up as you may suppose </s>
<s> 

but she was acquitted </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning
and worked the case in a way quite astonishing </s>
<s>  it was a desperate
case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked
it to general admiration </s>
<s>  in fact it may almost be said to have made
him </s>
<s>  he worked it himself at the policeoffice day after day for many
days contending against even a committal </s>
<s>  and at the trial where he
couldnt work it himself sat under counsel andevery one knewput
in all the salt and pepper </s>
<s>  the murdered person was a womana woman a
good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger </s>
<s>  it was
a case of jealousy </s>
<s>  they both led tramping lives and this woman in
gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as
we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy </s>
<s> 
the murdered womanmore a match for the man certainly in point of
yearswas found dead in a barn near hounslow heath </s>
<s>  there had been a
violent struggle perhaps a fight </s>
<s>  she was bruised and scratched and
torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked </s>
<s>  now there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and
on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it <abvr> jaggers
principally rested his case </s>
<s>  you may be sure said wemmick touching me
on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then
though he sometimes does now </s>
<s> 

i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner
party </s>
<s> 

well sir </s>
<s>  wemmick went on </s>
<s>  it happenedhappened dont you
see </s>
<s> that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was </s>
<s>  in
particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look </s>
<s>  she had only a bruise
or two about hernothing for a trampbut the backs of her hands
were lacerated and the question was was it with fingernails </s>
<s>  now <abvr>
jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her face </s>
<s>  but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of </s>
<s>  and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there </s>
<s>  but the boldest point he made was this </s>
<s> 
it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was
under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder
frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto
revenge herself upon him </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers worked that in this way </s>
<s>  we say
these are not marks of fingernails but marks of brambles and we show
you the brambles </s>
<s>  you say they are marks of fingernails and you set
up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child </s>
<s>  you must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis </s>
<s>  for anything we know she may have
destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched
her hands </s>
<s>  what then </s>
<s>  you are not trying her for the murder of her
child </s>
<s>  why dont you </s>
<s>  as to this case if you will have scratches
we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them </s>
<s>  to
sum up sir said wemmick <abvr> jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury and they gave in </s>
<s> 

has she been in his service ever since </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  but not only that said wemmick she went into his service
immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now </s>
<s>  she has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed
from the beginning </s>
<s> 

do you remember the sex of the child </s>
<s> 

said to have been a girl </s>
<s> 

you have nothing more to say to me tonight </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  i got your letter and destroyed it </s>
<s>  nothing </s>
<s> 

we exchanged a cordial goodnight and i went home with new matter for
my thoughts though with no relief from the old </s>

chapter xlix

putting miss havishams note in my pocket that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went
down again by the coach next day </s>
<s>  but i alighted at the halfway house
and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance </s>
<s>  for i sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it
in the same manner </s>
<s> 

the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the high street </s>
<s>  the nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves </s>
<s>  the cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding
observation than they had ever had before </s>
<s>  so the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music </s>
<s>  and the rooks as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that
estella was gone out of it for ever </s>
<s> 

an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the
gate </s>
<s>  the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old
and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone </s>
<s>  miss havisham was not
in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing </s>
<s>  looking
in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the
ashy fire </s>
<s> 

doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old
chimneypiece where she could see me when she raised her eyes </s>
<s>  there
was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to
pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge
her with </s>
<s>  as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the
progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house her eyes rested on me </s>
<s>  she stared and said in a low voice
is it real </s>
<s> 

it is i pip </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost
no time </s>
<s> 

thank you </s>
<s>  thank you </s>
<s> 

as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i
remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me </s>
<s> 

i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here and to show you that i am not all stone </s>
<s>  but perhaps you
can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart </s>
<s> 

when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right
hand as though she was going to touch me </s>
<s>  but she recalled it again
before i understood the action or knew how to receive it </s>
<s> 

you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good </s>
<s>  something that you would like done is it
not </s>
<s> 

something that i would like done very much </s>
<s> 

what is it </s>
<s> 

i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership </s>
<s>  i had
not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking
in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said </s>
<s>  it seemed to be
so </s>
<s>  for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed
that she was conscious of the fact </s>
<s> 

do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid
of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me </s>
<s> 

no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham </s>
<s>  i stopped
because i thought you were not following what i said </s>
<s> 

perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head </s>
<s>  begin
again and let me look at something else </s>
<s>  stay </s>
<s>  now tell me </s>
<s> 

she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend </s>
<s>  i went on with my explanation and told her
how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how
in this i was disappointed </s>
<s>  that part of the subject i reminded her
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they
were the weighty secrets of another </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  said she assenting with her head but not looking at me </s>
<s>  and how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase </s>
<s> 

i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum </s>
<s>  nine
hundred pounds </s>
<s> 

if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own </s>
<s> 

quite as faithfully </s>
<s> 

and your mind will be more at rest </s>
<s> 

much more at rest </s>
<s> 

are you very unhappy now </s>
<s> 

she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy </s>
<s>  i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed
me </s>
<s>  she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid
her forehead on it </s>
<s> 

i am far from happy miss havisham </s>
<s>  but i have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of </s>
<s>  they are the secrets i have mentioned </s>
<s> 

after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again </s>
<s> 

it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness </s>
<s>  is it true </s>
<s> 

too true </s>
<s> 

can i only serve you pip by serving your friend </s>
<s>  regarding that as
done is there nothing i can do for you yourself </s>
<s> 

nothing </s>
<s>  i thank you for the question </s>
<s>  i thank you even more for the
tone of the question </s>
<s>  but there is nothing </s>
<s> 

she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing </s>
<s>  there were none there and she took from her
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her neck </s>
<s> 

you are still on friendly terms with <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

quite </s>
<s>  i dined with him yesterday </s>
<s> 

this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend </s>
<s>  i keep no money here </s>
<s>  but if
you would rather <abvr> jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it
to you </s>
<s> 

thank you miss havisham </s>
<s>  i have not the least objection to receiving
it from him </s>
<s> 

she read me what she had written </s>
<s>  and it was direct and clear and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money </s>
<s>  i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled
again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached and put it in mine </s>
<s>  all this she did without
looking at me </s>
<s> 

my name is on the first leaf </s>
<s>  if you can ever write under my name i
forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it </s>
<s> 

o miss havisham said i i can do it now </s>
<s>  there have been sore
mistakes </s>
<s>  and my life has been a blind and thankless one </s>
<s>  and i want
forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you </s>
<s> 

she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it
and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees
at my feet </s>
<s>  with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which
when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have
been raised to heaven from her mothers side </s>
<s> 

to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame </s>
<s>  i entreated her to rise and got
my arms about her to help her up </s>
<s>  but she only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept </s>
<s>  i
had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the
relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking </s>
<s>  she was not
kneeling now but was down upon the ground </s>
<s> 

o </s>
<s>  she cried despairingly </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s> 

if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me
answer </s>
<s>  very little </s>
<s>  i should have loved her under any circumstances </s>
<s>  is
she married </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so </s>
<s> 

what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  she wrung her hands and crushed
her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again </s>
<s>  what have
i done </s>
<s> 

i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her </s>
<s>  that she had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found
vengeance in i knew full well </s>
<s>  but that in shutting out the light
of day she had shut out infinitely more </s>
<s>  that in seclusion she had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences </s>
<s>  that
her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew
equally well </s>
<s>  and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her
punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth
on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the
vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world </s>
<s> 

until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a
lookingglass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know
what i had done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  what have i done </s>
<s>  and so again
twenty fifty times over what had she done </s>
<s> 

miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience </s>
<s>  but estella is a different case and if
you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years </s>
<s> 

yes yes i know it </s>
<s>  but pipmy dear </s>
<s>  there was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her new affection </s>
<s>  my dear </s>
<s>  believe this </s>
<s>  when she
first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own </s>
<s>  at first
i meant no more </s>
<s> 

well well </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  i hope so </s>
<s> 

but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did
worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings
and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and
point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place </s>

with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then
burst out again what had she done </s>
<s> 

if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me </s>
<s> 

miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may
say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left
this neighborhood </s>
<s>  it has inspired me with great commiseration and i
hope i understand it and its influences </s>
<s>  does what has passed between us
give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella </s>
<s>  not as
she is but as she was when she first came here </s>
<s> 

she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and
her head leaning on them </s>
<s>  she looked full at me when i said this and
replied go on </s>
<s> 

whose child was estella </s>
<s> 

she shook her head </s>
<s> 

you dont know </s>
<s> 

she shook her head again </s>
<s> 

but <abvr> jaggers brought her here or sent her here </s>
<s> 

brought her here </s>
<s> 

will you tell me how that came about </s>
<s> 

she answered in a low whisper and with caution </s>
<s>  i had been shut up in
these rooms a long time i dont know how long </s>
<s>  you know what time the
clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear
and love and save from my fate </s>
<s>  i had first seen him when i sent
for him to lay this place waste for me </s>
<s>  having read of him in the
newspapers before i and the world parted </s>
<s>  he told me that he would
look about him for such an orphan child </s>
<s>  one night he brought her here
asleep and i called her estella </s>
<s> 

might i ask her age then </s>
<s> 

two or three </s>
<s>  she herself knows nothing but that she was left an
orphan and i adopted her </s>
<s> 

so convinced i was of that womans being her mother that i wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind </s>
<s>  but to any mind i
thought the connection here was clear and straight </s>
<s> 

what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview </s>
<s>  i had
succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew
of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind </s>
<s>  no matter
with what other words we parted </s>
<s>  we parted </s>
<s> 

twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air </s>
<s>  i
called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would
not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving </s>
<s> 
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it </s>
<s> 

by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which
the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end i made my way to the ruined garden </s>
<s>  i went all round it </s>
<s>  round by
the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle </s>
<s>  round by the paths
where estella and i had walked </s>
<s>  so cold so lonely so dreary all </s>
<s> 

taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it and walked through </s>
<s>  i was going out at the
opposite doornot easy to open now for the damp wood had started and
swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of funguswhen i turned my head to look back </s>
<s>  a childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam </s>
<s>  so
strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before i knew it was a fancythough to be sure i was
there in an instant </s>
<s> 

the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of
this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i
had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart </s>
<s>  passing on into
the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs
and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left
her </s>
<s>  i took the latter course and went up </s>
<s> 

i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards
me </s>
<s>  in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away
i saw a great flaming light spring up </s>
<s>  in the same moment i saw her
running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her
and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high </s>
<s> 

i had a doublecaped greatcoat on and over my arm another thick coat </s>
<s> 
that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over
her </s>
<s>  that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and
all the ugly things that sheltered there </s>
<s>  that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her
the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herselfthat this
occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or
thought or knew i did </s>
<s>  i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the
floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded
bridal dress </s>
<s> 

then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door </s>
<s>  i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like
a prisoner who might escape </s>
<s>  and i doubt if i even knew who she was or
why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames
were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us </s>
<s> 

she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even
touched </s>
<s>  assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if
i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire
would break out again and consume her </s>
<s>  when i got up on the surgeons
coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt </s>
<s>  for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling </s>
<s> 

on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless </s>
<s>  the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock </s>
<s>  by the surgeons directions her bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her injuries </s>
<s>  when i saw her again an
hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick
and had heard her say that she would lie one day </s>
<s> 

though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance </s>
<s>  for they had
covered her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her </s>
<s> 

i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i
got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post </s>
<s>  miss havishams family i took upon myself </s>
<s>  intending to
communicate with <abvr> matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he
liked about informing the rest </s>
<s>  this i did next day through herbert as
soon as i returned to town </s>
<s> 

there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had
happened though with a certain terrible vivacity </s>
<s>  towards midnight she
began to wander in her speech </s>
<s>  and after that it gradually set in that
she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done </s>
<s> 
 and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like
mine </s>
<s>  and then take the pencil and write under my name ˜i forgive
her </s>
<s>  she never changed the order of these three sentences but she
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them </s>
<s>  never putting in
another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word </s>
<s> 

as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive
out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would
return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being
taken up clear of the town </s>
<s>  at about six oclock of the morning
therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as
they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write
under my name ˜i forgive her </s>
<s> 




chapter l

my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in
the morning </s>
<s>  my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less
severely as high as the shoulder </s>
<s>  it was very painful but the flames
had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse </s>
<s>  my right
hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers </s>
<s>  it was
bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm </s>
<s>  those i carried in a sling </s>
<s>  and i could only wear my coat like a
cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck </s>
<s>  my hair had
been caught by the fire but not my head or face </s>
<s> 

when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came
back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me </s>
<s>  he
was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them
on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for </s>
<s> 

at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i
might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell </s>
<s>  if i
dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havishams cries and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head </s>
<s>  this pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i
suffered </s>
<s>  and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention
engaged </s>
<s> 

neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it </s>
<s>  that
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our
agreeingwithout agreementto make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours not of so many weeks </s>
<s> 

my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all
was well down the river </s>
<s>  as he replied in the affirmative with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away </s>
<s>  but then as herbert changed the bandages more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it
spontaneously </s>
<s> 

i sat with provis last night handel two good hours </s>
<s> 

where was clara </s>
<s> 

dear little thing </s>
<s>  said herbert </s>
<s>  she was up and down with
gruffandgrim all the evening </s>
<s>  he was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she left his sight </s>
<s>  i doubt if he can hold out long though </s>
<s> 
what with rum and pepperand pepper and rumi should think his
pegging must be nearly over </s>
<s> 

and then you will be married herbert </s>
<s> 

how can i take care of the dear child otherwise </s>
<s> lay your arm out upon
the back of the sofa my dear boy and ill sit down here and get the
bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes </s>
<s>  i was
speaking of provis </s>
<s>  do you know handel he improves </s>
<s> 

i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him </s>
<s> 

so you did </s>
<s>  and so he is </s>
<s>  he was very communicative last night and
told me more of his life </s>
<s>  you remember his breaking off here about some
woman that he had had great trouble with </s>
<s> did i hurt you </s>
<s> 

i had started but not under his touch </s>
<s>  his words had given me a start </s>
<s> 

i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is </s>
<s> 
shall i tell you </s>
<s>  or would it worry you just now </s>
<s> 

tell me by all means </s>
<s>  every word </s>
<s> 

herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for </s>
<s>  your
head is cool </s>
<s>  he said touching it </s>
<s> 

quite said i </s>
<s>  tell me what provis said my dear herbert </s>
<s> 

it seems said herbert theres a bandage off most charmingly and
now comes the cool onemakes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow
dont it </s>
<s>  but it will be comfortable presentlyit seems that the
woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman </s>
<s> 
revengeful handel to the last degree </s>
<s> 

to what last degree </s>
<s> 

murder </s>
<s> does it strike too cold on that sensitive place </s>
<s> 

i dont feel it </s>
<s>  how did she murder </s>
<s>  whom did she murder </s>
<s> 

why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name
 said herbert but she was tried for it and <abvr> jaggers defended
her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known
to provis </s>
<s>  it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim
and there had been a strugglein a barn </s>
<s>  who began it or how fair
it was or how unfair may be doubtful </s>
<s>  but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled </s>
<s> 

was the woman brought in guilty </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  she was acquitted </s>
<s> my poor handel i hurt you </s>
<s> 

it is impossible to be gentler herbert </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  what else </s>
<s> 

this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child </s>
<s>  a little
child of whom provis was exceedingly fond </s>
<s>  on the evening of the very
night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the
young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore
that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he
should never see it again </s>
<s>  then she vanished </s>
<s> theres the worst arm
comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right
hand which is a far easier job </s>
<s>  i can do it better by this light
than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i dont see the poor
blistered patches too distinctly </s>
<s> you dont think your breathing is
affected my dear boy </s>
<s>  you seem to breathe quickly </s>
<s> 

perhaps i do herbert </s>
<s>  did the woman keep her oath </s>
<s> 

there comes the darkest part of proviss life </s>
<s>  she did </s>
<s> 

that is he says she did </s>
<s> 

why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise
and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me </s>
<s>  he says it all </s>
<s>  i
have no other information </s>
<s> 

no to be sure </s>
<s> 

now whether pursued herbert he had used the childs mother ill or
whether he had used the childs mother well provis doesnt say </s>
<s>  but she
had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described
to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and
forbearance towards her </s>
<s>  therefore fearing he should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he
hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he
says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose </s>
<s>  after
the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the
childs mother </s>
<s> 

i want to ask

a moment my dear boy and i have done </s>
<s>  that evil genius compeyson
the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping
out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course
afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him
poorer and working him harder </s>
<s>  it was clear last night that this barbed
the point of proviss animosity </s>
<s> 

i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told
you when this happened </s>
<s> 

particularly </s>
<s>  let me remember then what he said as to that </s>
<s>  his
expression was ˜a round score o year ago and amost directly after i
took up wi compeyson </s>
<s>  how old were you when you came upon him in the
little churchyard </s>
<s> 

i think in my seventh year </s>
<s> 

ay </s>
<s>  it had happened some three or four years then he said and you
brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have
been about your age </s>
<s> 

herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see
me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire </s>
<s> 

by the firelight answered herbert coming close again </s>
<s> 

look at me </s>
<s> 

i do look at you my dear boy </s>
<s> 

touch me </s>
<s> 

i do touch you my dear boy </s>
<s> 

you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night </s>
<s> 

nno my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me </s>
<s>  you
are rather excited but you are quite yourself </s>
<s> 

i know i am quite myself </s>
<s>  and the man we have in hiding down the river
is estellas father </s>
<s> 




chapter li

what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving
estellas parentage i cannot say </s>
<s>  it will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own </s>
<s> 

but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized
with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter downthat i
ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see <abvr> jaggers and come
at the bare truth </s>
<s>  i really do not know whether i felt that i did this
for estellas sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me </s>
<s>  perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth </s>
<s> 

any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street
that night </s>
<s>  herberts representations that if i did i should probably
be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitives safety would depend
upon me alone restrained my impatience </s>
<s>  on the understanding again
and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to <abvr> jaggers
tomorrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts
looked after and to stay at home </s>
<s>  early next morning we went out
together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left
herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain </s>
<s> 

there were periodical occasions when <abvr> jaggers and wemmick went over
the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things
straight </s>
<s>  on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into <abvr>
jaggerss room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer
office </s>
<s>  finding such clerk on wemmicks post that morning i knew
what was going on </s>
<s>  but i was not sorry to have <abvr> jaggers and wemmick
together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to
compromise him </s>
<s> 

my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders
favored my object </s>
<s>  although i had sent <abvr> jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all
the details now </s>
<s>  and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence than it had been before </s>
<s>  while i described the disaster <abvr>
jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire </s>
<s>  wemmick leaned
back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his
trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post </s>
<s>  the two brutal
casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at
the present moment </s>
<s> 

my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced
miss havishams authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
herbert </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick
with instructions to draw the check for his signature </s>
<s>  while that was
in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and <abvr>
jaggers poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots looked
on at me </s>
<s>  i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket
when he had signed it that we do nothing for you </s>
<s> 

miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she
could do nothing for me and i told her no </s>
<s> 

everybody should know his own business said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  and i saw
wemmicks lips form the words portable property </s>
<s> 

i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers </s>
<s> 
but every man ought to know his own business best </s>
<s> 

every mans business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me
is portable property </s>
<s> 

as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at
heart i said turning on <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

i did ask something of miss havisham however sir </s>
<s>  i asked her to give
me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me
all she possessed </s>
<s> 

did she </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself </s>
<s>  hah </s>
<s>  i dont think i should have done so
if i had been miss havisham </s>
<s>  but she ought to know her own business
best </s>
<s> 

i know more of the history of miss havishams adopted child than miss
havisham herself does sir </s>
<s>  i know her mother </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother </s>
<s> 

i have seen her mother within these three days </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

and so have you sir </s>
<s>  and you have seen her still more recently </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

perhaps i know more of estellas history than even you do said i </s>
<s>  i
know her father too </s>
<s> 

a certain stop that <abvr> jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too
selfpossessed to change his manner but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not
know who her father was </s>
<s>  this i had strongly suspected from proviss
account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark </s>
<s> 
which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not <abvr> jaggerss
client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for
claiming his identity </s>
<s>  but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on <abvr> jaggerss part before though i was quite sure of it now </s>
<s> 

so </s>
<s>  you know the young ladys father pip </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

yes i replied and his name is provisfrom new south wales </s>
<s> 

even <abvr> jaggers started when i said those words </s>
<s>  it was the slightest
start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the
action of taking out his pockethandkerchief </s>
<s>  how wemmick received the
announcement i am unable to say </s>
<s>  for i was afraid to look at him just
then lest <abvr> jaggerss sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him between us </s>
<s> 

and on what evidence pip asked <abvr> jaggers very coolly as he
paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make
this claim </s>
<s> 

he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence </s>
<s> 

for once the powerful pockethandkerchief failed </s>
<s>  my reply was so
unexpected that <abvr> jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked
with stern attention at me though with an immovable face </s>
<s> 

then i told him all i knew and how i knew it </s>
<s>  with the one reservation
that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact
knew from wemmick </s>
<s>  i was very careful indeed as to that </s>
<s>  nor did i look
towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for
some time silently meeting <abvr> jaggerss look </s>
<s>  when i did at last turn
my eyes in wemmicks direction i found that he had unposted his pen
and was intent upon the table before him </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the
table </s>
<s>  what item was it you were at wemmick when <abvr> pip came in </s>
<s> 

but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a
passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and
manly with me </s>
<s>  i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had
lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had
made </s>
<s>  and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits </s>
<s>  i
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted </s>
<s>  i said that
i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted
assurance of the truth from him </s>
<s>  and if he asked me why i wanted it
and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he
cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long
and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world </s>
<s>  and seeing that <abvr> jaggers stood quite still and
silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to
wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle
heart </s>
<s>  i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the
innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life </s>
<s>  and i entreat you to say a word for me to <abvr> jaggers and to
represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more
open with me </s>
<s> 

i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than <abvr>
jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe </s>
<s>  at first a misgiving
crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment </s>
<s>  but it melted as i saw <abvr> jaggers relax into something like
a smile and wemmick become bolder </s>
<s> 

whats all this </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s>  you with an old father and you
with pleasant and playful ways </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  returned wemmick </s>
<s>  if i dont bring ˜em here what does it
matter </s>
<s> 

pip said <abvr> jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling
openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london </s>
<s> 

not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder </s>
<s>  i think
youre another </s>
<s> 

again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in </s>
<s> 

you with a pleasant home </s>
<s>  said <abvr> jaggers </s>
<s> 

since it dont interfere with business returned wemmick let it be
so </s>
<s>  now i look at you sir i shouldnt wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days
when youre tired of all this work </s>
<s> 

mr </s>
<s>  jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and
actually drew a sigh </s>
<s>  pip said he we wont talk about ˜poor
dreams </s>
<s>  you know more about such things than i having much fresher
experience of that kind </s>
<s>  but now about this other matter </s>
<s>  ill put a
case to you </s>
<s>  mind </s>
<s>  i admit nothing </s>
<s> 

he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing </s>
<s> 

now pip said <abvr> jaggers put this case </s>
<s>  put the case that a
woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child
concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser
on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the
latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child </s>
<s>  put the
case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up </s>
<s> 

i follow you sir </s>

off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and

i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave </s>

lips with his forefinger </s>

now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what
item was it you were at when <abvr> pip came in </s>

standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times </s>

this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say

the other </s>

another </s>

justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment </s>

got on very well indeed together </s>

but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his

<s>  this individual who either in his own person or in that
of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in
that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter

circumstance to wemmick <abvr> jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings mikes eye happened to
twinkle with a tear </s>

what are you about </s>

what do you come snivelling here for </s>

i didnt go to do it <abvr> wemmick </s>

you did said wemmick </s>

chapter lii


from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss
skiffinss brother the accountant </s>
<s>  and miss skiffinss brother the
accountant going straight to clarrikers and bringing clarriker to me
i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement </s>
<s>  it was the
only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done
since i was first apprised of my great expectations </s>
<s> 

clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house
were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a
small branchhouse in the east which was much wanted for the extension
of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for
a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more
settled </s>
<s>  and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves </s>
<s> 

but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told
me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara
barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join
them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the
nile and seeing wonders </s>
<s>  without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans i felt that herberts way was clearing fast and
that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his
daughter would soon be happily provided for </s>
<s> 

we had now got into the month of march </s>
<s>  my left arm though it presented
no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i
was still unable to get a coat on </s>
<s>  my right arm was tolerably restored </s>
<s> 
disfigured but fairly serviceable </s>
<s> 

on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received
the following letter from wemmick by the post </s>
<s> 

walworth </s>
<s>  burn this as soon as read </s>
<s>  early in the week or say
wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try
it </s>
<s>  now burn </s>
<s> 

when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the firebut not
before we had both got it by heartwe considered what to do </s>
<s>  for of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view </s>
<s> 

i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i
know a better course than taking a thames waterman </s>
<s>  take startop </s>
<s>  a good
fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honorable </s>
<s> 

i had thought of him more than once </s>
<s> 

but how much would you tell him herbert </s>
<s> 

it is necessary to tell him very little </s>
<s>  let him suppose it a mere
freak but a secret one until the morning comes </s>
<s>  then let him know that
there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away </s>
<s>  you go
with him </s>
<s> 

no doubt </s>
<s> 

where </s>
<s> 

it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the
point almost indifferent what port we made forhamburg rotterdam
antwerpthe place signified little so that he was out of england </s>
<s>  any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do </s>
<s> 
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the
boat </s>
<s>  certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot </s>
<s>  as foreign steamers would
leave london at about the time of highwater our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebbtide and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one </s>
<s>  the time when one would be due where we
lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we
made inquiries beforehand </s>
<s> 

herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations </s>
<s>  we found that a steamer for
hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel </s>
<s>  but we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each </s>
<s>  we then separated
for a few hours </s>
<s>  i to get at once such passports as were necessary </s>
<s> 
herbert to see startop at his lodgings </s>
<s>  we both did what we had to do
without any hindrance and when we met again at one oclock reported
it done </s>
<s>  i for my part was prepared with passports </s>
<s>  herbert had seen
startop and he was more than ready to join </s>
<s> 

those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer </s>
<s>  our
charge would be sitter and keep quiet </s>
<s>  as speed was not our object we
should make way enough </s>
<s>  we arranged that herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening </s>
<s>  that he should
not go there at all tomorrow evening tuesday </s>
<s>  that he should prepare
provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when
he saw us approach and not sooner </s>
<s>  that all the arrangements with
him should be concluded that monday night </s>
<s>  and that he should be
communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board </s>
<s> 

these precautions well understood by both of us i went home </s>
<s> 

on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter
in the box directed to me </s>
<s>  a very dirty letter though not illwritten </s>
<s> 
it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its
contents were these </s>
<s> 

if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow
night at nine and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln
you had better come </s>
<s>  if you want information regarding your uncle
provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time </s>
<s>  you
must come alone </s>
<s>  bring this with you </s>
<s> 

i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter </s>
<s>  what to do now i could not tell </s>
<s>  and the worst was that i must
decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take
me down in time for tonight </s>
<s>  tomorrow night i could not think of
going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight </s>
<s>  and again
for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself </s>
<s> 

if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have
gone </s>
<s>  having hardly any time for considerationmy watch showing me
that the coach started within half an houri resolved to go </s>
<s>  i should
certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis </s>
<s>  that
coming on wemmicks letter and the mornings busy preparation turned
the scale </s>
<s> 

it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind </s>
<s>  yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should
be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry
down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring </s>
<s> 
i had then barely time to get my greatcoat lock up the chambers
and make for the coachoffice by the short byways </s>
<s>  if i had taken a
hackneychariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim </s>
<s> 
going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard </s>
<s>  i
was the only inside passenger jolting away kneedeep in straw when i
came to myself </s>
<s> 

for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter </s>
<s>  it had
so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning </s>
<s>  the morning hurry
and flutter had been great </s>
<s>  for long and anxiously as i had waited for
wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last </s>
<s>  and now i began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had
sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should
get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried
people are strangers </s>
<s>  still the reference to provis by name mastered
everything </s>
<s>  i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing itif
that be reasoningin case any harm should befall him through my not
going how could i ever forgive myself </s>
<s> 

it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside
in my disabled state </s>
<s>  avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner </s>
<s>  while it was
preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham </s>
<s>  she was
still very ill though considered something better </s>
<s> 

my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i
dined in a little octagonal commonroom like a font </s>
<s>  as i was not able
to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me </s>
<s>  this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain
me with my own storyof course with the popular feature that
pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes </s>
<s> 

do you know the young man </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

know him </s>
<s>  repeated the landlord </s>
<s>  ever since he wasno height at
all </s>
<s> 

does he ever come back to this neighborhood </s>
<s> 

ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and
again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him </s>
<s> 

what man is that </s>
<s> 

him that i speak of said the landlord </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook </s>
<s> 

is he ungrateful to no one else </s>
<s> 

no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he
cant </s>
<s>  and why </s>
<s>  because pumblechook done everything for him </s>
<s> 

does pumblechook say so </s>
<s> 

say so </s>
<s>  replied the landlord </s>
<s>  he hant no call to say so </s>
<s> 

but does he say so </s>
<s> 

it would turn a mans blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of
it sir said the landlord </s>
<s> 

i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it </s>
<s>  longsuffering and
loving joe you never complain </s>
<s>  nor you sweettempered biddy </s>
<s> 

your appetites been touched like by your accident said the landlord
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat </s>
<s>  try a tenderer bit </s>
<s> 

no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the
fire </s>
<s>  i can eat no more </s>
<s>  please take it away </s>
<s> 

i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as
through the brazen impostor pumblechook </s>
<s>  the falser he the truer joe </s>
<s> 
the meaner he the nobler joe </s>
<s> 

my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire
for an hour or more </s>
<s>  the striking of the clock aroused me but not from
my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck and went out </s>
<s>  i had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter that i might refer to it again </s>
<s>  but i could not find it and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach </s>
<s>  i knew very well however that the appointed place was the
little sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine </s>
<s> 
towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare </s>
<s> 




chapter liii

it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed
lands and passed out upon the marshes </s>
<s>  beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon </s>
<s> 
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the
piled mountains of cloud </s>
<s> 

there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal </s>
<s>  a
stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were
so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back </s>
<s>  but i knew
them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had
no excuse for returning being there </s>
<s>  so having come there against my
inclination i went on against it </s>
<s> 

the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts </s>
<s>  my back was turned towards
the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder </s>
<s>  i knew the
limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart </s>
<s> 
so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks </s>
<s> 

at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds </s>
<s>  but after a little while i
seemed to have the whole flats to myself </s>
<s> 

it was another halfhour before i drew near to the kiln </s>
<s>  the lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and
left and no workmen were visible </s>
<s>  hard by was a small stonequarry </s>
<s>  it
lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about </s>
<s> 

coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavationfor the rude
path lay through iti saw a light in the old sluicehouse </s>
<s>  i quickened
my pace and knocked at the door with my hand </s>
<s>  waiting for some reply
i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and
how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the
weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me </s>
<s>  still there was no answer and i knocked again </s>
<s> 
no answer still and i tried the latch </s>
<s> 

it rose under my hand and the door yielded </s>
<s>  looking in i saw a lighted
candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead </s>
<s>  as
there was a loft above i called is there any one here </s>
<s>  but no voice
answered </s>
<s>  then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine
called again is there any one here </s>
<s>  there being still no answer i
went out at the door irresolute what to do </s>
<s> 

it was beginning to rain fast </s>
<s>  seeing nothing save what i had seen
already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway looking out into the night </s>
<s>  while i was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or
the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the
wick were long </s>
<s>  i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in
my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock </s>
<s>  and the next
thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running
noose thrown over my head from behind </s>
<s> 

now said a suppressed voice with an oath ive got you </s>
<s> 

what is this </s>
<s>  i cried struggling </s>
<s>  who is it </s>
<s>  help help help </s>
<s> 

not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain </s>
<s>  sometimes a strong mans hand
sometimes a strong mans breast was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled
ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall </s>
<s>  and
now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and
ill make short work of you </s>
<s> 

faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the
surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little </s>
<s> 
but it was bound too tight for that </s>
<s>  i felt as if having been burnt
before it were now being boiled </s>
<s> 

the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black
darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter </s>
<s> 
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he
wanted and began to strike a light </s>
<s>  i strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed
match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of
the match </s>
<s>  even those but fitfully </s>
<s>  the tinder was dampno wonder
thereand one after another the sparks died out </s>
<s> 

the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel </s>
<s>  as
the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and
touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending
over the table </s>
<s>  but nothing more </s>
<s>  presently i saw his blue lips again
breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and
showed me orlick </s>
<s> 

whom i had looked for i dont know </s>
<s>  i had not looked for him </s>
<s>  seeing
him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes
upon him </s>
<s> 

he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation
and dropped the match and trod it out </s>
<s>  then he put the candle away from
him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded
on the table and looked at me </s>
<s>  i made out that i was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the walla fixture therethe
means of ascent to the loft above </s>
<s> 

now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time ive
got you </s>
<s> 

unbind me </s>
<s>  let me go </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  he returned ill let you go </s>
<s>  ill let you go to the moon ill
let you go to the stars </s>
<s>  all in good time </s>
<s> 

why have you lured me here </s>
<s> 

dont you know </s>
<s>  said he with a deadly look </s>
<s> 

why have you set upon me in the dark </s>
<s> 

because i mean to do it all myself </s>
<s>  one keeps a secret better than two </s>
<s> 
o you enemy you enemy </s>
<s> 

his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms
folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a
malignity in it that made me tremble </s>
<s>  as i watched him in silence
he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a
brassbound stock </s>
<s> 

do you know this </s>
<s>  said he making as if he would take aim at me </s>
<s>  do
you know where you saw it afore </s>
<s>  speak wolf </s>
<s> 

yes i answered </s>
<s> 

you cost me that place </s>
<s>  you did </s>
<s>  speak </s>
<s> 

what else could i do </s>
<s> 

you did that and that would be enough without more </s>
<s>  how dared you to
come betwixt me and a young woman i liked </s>
<s> 

when did i </s>
<s> 

when didnt you </s>
<s>  it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to
her </s>
<s> 

you gave it to yourself </s>
<s>  you gained it for yourself </s>
<s>  i could have done
you no harm if you had done yourself none </s>
<s> 

youre a liar </s>
<s>  and youll take any pains and spend any money to drive
me out of this country will you </s>
<s>  said he repeating my words to biddy
in the last interview i had with her </s>
<s>  now ill tell you a piece of
information </s>
<s>  it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is tonight </s>
<s>  ah </s>
<s>  if it was all your money twenty times
told to the last brass farden </s>
<s>  as he shook his heavy hand at me with
his mouth snarling like a tigers i felt that it was true </s>
<s> 

what are you going to do to me </s>
<s> 

im a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater forceim
a going to have your life </s>
<s> 

he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again </s>
<s> 

you was always in old orlicks way since ever you was a child </s>
<s>  you goes
out of his way this present night </s>
<s>  hell have no more on you </s>
<s>  youre
dead </s>
<s> 

i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave </s>
<s>  for a moment i looked
wildly round my trap for any chance of escape </s>
<s>  but there was none </s>
<s> 

more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i wont
have a rag of you i wont have a bone of you left on earth </s>
<s>  ill put
your body in the kilnid carry two such to it on my shouldersand
let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing </s>
<s> 

my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death </s>
<s>  estellas father would believe i had deserted him
would be taken would die accusing me </s>
<s>  even herbert would doubt me
when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had
called at miss havishams gate for only a moment </s>
<s>  joe and biddy would
never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what
i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed
through </s>
<s>  the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death </s>
<s>  and
so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn
generationsestellas children and their childrenwhile the
wretchs words were yet on his lips </s>
<s> 

now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beastwhich is
wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up forill have a good look
at you and a good goad at you </s>
<s>  o you enemy </s>
<s> 

it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again </s>
<s>  though
few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the
hopelessness of aid </s>
<s>  but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by
a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips </s>
<s>  above all things i
resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some
last poor resistance to him </s>
<s>  softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity </s>
<s>  humbly beseeching pardon as i did of
heaven </s>
<s>  melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no
farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errorsstill if i could have killed him even in dying i
would have done it </s>
<s> 

he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot </s>

he drank again and became more ferocious </s>

the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it </s>

understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me </s>

that when i was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do
as he had done in my sisters casemake all haste to the town and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses </s>
<s>  my rapid mind
pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it

vapor creeping over it into which i should have dissolved </s>
<s> 

it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years

to me and not mere words </s>

images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himselfwho

when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which
he sat and pushed the table aside </s>

shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood
before me looking at me and enjoying the sight </s>

he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an
instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
light on the table </s>

biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again </s>

there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall </s>

great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he
did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with
his eyes scowling at me </s>

<s>  wild as my inward
hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had
resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told </s>
<s> 

of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed
it away </s>

slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at
me no more </s>

hand and licked up </s>
<s>  then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped </s>

hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle </s>
<s> 

the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and
struggled with all my might </s>
<s>  it was only my head and my legs that i
could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until

voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if

<s> 

after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the

ladder against the wall when i came to myselfhad opened on it before

me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it
a face </s>

<s> 

i think hes all right </s>
<s>  said trabbs boy in a sober voice </s>
<s>  but aint
he just pale though </s>

at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine
and i saw my supporter to be

yes yes said i i can walk </s>
<s>  i have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm </s>
<s> 

they laid it bare and did what they could </s>
<s>  it was violently swollen and
inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched </s>
<s>  but they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced
it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it </s>
<s>  in a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluicehouse and were passing through the quarry on our
way back </s>
<s>  trabbs boytrabbs overgrown young man nowwent before us
with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door </s>
<s>  but
the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky
and the night though rainy was much lighter </s>
<s>  the white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer
before i thought a thanksgiving now </s>
<s> 

entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescuewhich at
first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining
quieti learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our
chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i
was gone </s>
<s>  its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him </s>
<s>  his
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an
hours consideration he set off for the coachoffice with startop who
volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went
down </s>
<s>  finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he
resolved to follow in a postchaise </s>
<s>  so he and startop arrived at the
blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me </s>
<s>  but
finding neither went on to miss havishams where they lost me </s>
<s> 
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when
i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes </s>
<s>  among
the loungers under the boars archway happened to be trabbs boytrue
to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no
businessand trabbs boy had seen me passing from miss havishams in
the direction of my diningplace </s>
<s>  thus trabbs boy became their guide
and with him they went out to the sluicehouse though by the town way
to the marshes which i had avoided </s>
<s>  now as they went along herbert
reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to proviss safety and
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous
left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by
himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within </s>
<s>  as he could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so
busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly
i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely
followed by the other two </s>
<s> 

when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it
was and getting out a warrant </s>
<s>  but i had already considered that such
a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might
be fatal to provis </s>
<s>  there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time </s>
<s>  for the
present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to trabbs boy </s>
<s>  who i am convinced would have been
much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention
saved me from the limekiln </s>
<s>  not that trabbs boy was of a malignant
nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodys expense </s>
<s>  when
we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his
views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him which made no impression on him at all </s>
<s> 

wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london
that night three in the postchaise </s>
<s>  the rather as we should then be
clear away before the nights adventure began to be talked of </s>
<s>  herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm </s>
<s>  and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain
on the journey </s>
<s>  it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went
at once to bed and lay in bed all day </s>
<s> 

my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for
tomorrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of
itself </s>
<s>  it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon
me that tomorrow was </s>
<s>  so anxiously looked forward to charged with such
consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near </s>
<s> 

no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day </s>
<s>  yet this again increased my
restlessness </s>
<s>  i started at every footstep and every sound believing
that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell
me so </s>
<s>  i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken </s>
<s>  that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment </s>
<s>  that the fact
had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it </s>
<s>  as the days wore
on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow
morning altogether mastered me </s>
<s>  my burning arm throbbed and my burning
head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander </s>
<s>  i counted up to
high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew
in prose and verse </s>
<s>  it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot </s>
<s>  then i would say to
myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious </s>
<s> 

they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and
gave me cooling drinks </s>
<s>  whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion
i had had in the sluicehouse that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him was gone </s>
<s>  about midnight i got out of bed
and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for
fourandtwenty hours and that wednesday was past </s>
<s>  it was the last
selfexhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept
soundly </s>
<s> 

wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window </s>
<s>  the winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon </s>
<s>  the river still dark and mysterious was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky </s>
<s>  as i looked along
the clustered roofs with churchtowers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters </s>
<s>  from me
too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well </s>
<s> 

herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on
the sofa </s>
<s>  i could not dress myself without help </s>
<s>  but i made up the fire
which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them </s>
<s>  in good
time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us </s>
<s> 

when it turns at nine oclock said herbert cheerfully look out for
us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank </s>

chapter liv

it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold </s>
<s>  when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade </s>
<s> 
we had our peacoats with us and i took a bag </s>
<s>  of all my worldly
possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag </s>
<s>  where i might go what i might do or when i might return were
questions utterly unknown to me </s>
<s>  nor did i vex my mind with them for
it was wholly set on proviss safety </s>
<s>  i only wondered for the passing
moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered
circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever </s>
<s> 

we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all </s>
<s>  of course i had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order </s>
<s>  after
a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went
on board and cast off </s>
<s>  herbert in the bow i steering </s>
<s>  it was then about
highwaterhalfpast eight </s>
<s> 

our plan was this </s>
<s>  the tide beginning to run down at nine and being
with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned
and row against it until dark </s>
<s>  we should then be well in those long
reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is
broad and solitary where the waterside inhabitants are very few and
where lone publichouses are scattered here and there of which we could
choose one for a restingplace </s>
<s>  there we meant to lie by all night </s>
<s> 
the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from
london at about nine on thursday morning </s>
<s>  we should know at what time
to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first </s>
<s> 
so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have
another chance </s>
<s>  we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel </s>
<s> 

the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which i had been a few hours before </s>
<s>  the crisp air the sunlight the
movement on the river and the moving river itselfthe road that ran
with us seeming to sympathize with us animate us and encourage us
onfreshened me with new hope </s>
<s>  i felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat </s>
<s>  but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day </s>
<s> 

at that time the steamtraffic on the thames was far below its present
extent and watermens boats were far more numerous </s>
<s>  of barges sailing
colliers and coastingtraders there were perhaps as many as now </s>
<s> 
but of steamships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many </s>
<s>  early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide </s>
<s> 
the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these </s>
<s>  and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly </s>
<s> 

old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its
oysterboats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitors gate and
we were in among the tiers of shipping </s>
<s>  here were the leith aberdeen
and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside </s>
<s>  here were colliers by the
score and score with the coalwhippers plunging off stages on deck as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled
over the side into barges </s>
<s>  here at her moorings was tomorrows steamer
for rotterdam of which we took good notice </s>
<s>  and here tomorrows for
hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed </s>
<s>  and now i sitting in the
stern could see with a faster beating heart mill pond bank and mill
pond stairs </s>

bag </s>

again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty
chaincables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the
moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood
and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the
figurehead of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as

clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky ships
capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible seacreatures
roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and
outout at last upon the clearer river where the ships boys might
take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled waters with them
over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind </s>
<s> 

at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had
looked warily for any token of our being suspected </s>
<s>  i had seen none </s>
<s>  we
certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either
attended or followed by any boat </s>
<s>  if we had been waited on by any boat
i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to
make her purpose evident </s>
<s>  but we held our own without any appearance of
molestation </s>
<s> 

he had his boatcloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part
of the scene </s>
<s>  it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had
led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us </s>
<s>  he
was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country </s>
<s>  he was not
disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it </s>
<s>  but he had no
notion of meeting danger half way </s>
<s>  when it came upon him he confronted
it but it must come before he troubled himself </s>
<s> 

if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day

mebut i aint a going to be low </s>
<s> 

it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he
should have endangered his freedom and even his life </s>
<s>  but i reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man </s>

was not far out since he said after smoking a little </s>

<s> 

if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again

well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so </s>
<s> 

and think so </s>
<s> 

he dipped his hand in the water over the boats gunwale and said
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me </s>

ay i spose i think so dear boy </s>
<s>  wed be puzzled to be more quiet
and easygoing than we are at present </s>
<s>  butits a flowing so soft

 holding up his dripping hand </s>

not a bit on it dear boy </s>
<s>  it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that
there rippling at the boats head making a sort of a sunday tune </s>
<s>  maybe
im a growing a trifle old besides </s>
<s> 

he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
england </s>
<s>  yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been
in constant terror </s>
<s>  for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would
be safest where he was and he said </s>
<s>  do you dear boy </s>
<s>  and quietly sat
down again </s>
<s> 

the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the
sunshine was very cheering </s>
<s>  the tide ran strong i took care to lose
none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well </s>
<s>  by
imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the
nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy
banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend </s>

charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or
twos length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the
stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us </s>
<s>  and soon
the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing
and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks </s>
<s> 

our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive
with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hours rest
proved full as much as they wanted </s>
<s>  we got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about </s>
<s> 
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a
dim horizon </s>
<s>  while the winding river turned and turned and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed
stranded and still </s>
<s>  for now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed </s>
<s>  and the last green barge strawladen
with a brown sail had followed </s>
<s>  and some ballastlighters shaped like
a childs first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud </s>

little squat shoallighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud

<s>  and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud and an old landingstage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud </s>
<s> 

we pushed off again and made what way we could </s>
<s>  it was much harder work
now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down </s>
<s>  by that time the river had lifted us a little
so that we could see above the bank </s>
<s>  there was the red sun on the low
level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black </s>
<s>  and
there was the solitary flat marsh </s>
<s>  and far away there were the rising
grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull </s>
<s> 

as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full
would not rise early we held a little council </s>
<s>  a short one for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find </s>
<s>  so
they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a
house </s>
<s>  thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles </s>
<s>  it
was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galleyfire smoking
and flaring looked like a comfortable home </s>
<s>  the night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning </s>
<s>  and what light we had seemed
to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars </s>
<s> 

at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed </s>
<s>  as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore </s>
<s>  and whenever such a sound came one or
other of us was sure to start and look in that direction </s>
<s>  here and
there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them
nervously </s>
<s>  sometimes what was that ripple </s>
<s>  one of us would say in a
low voice </s>
<s>  or another is that a boat yonder </s>
<s>  and afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels </s>
<s> 

at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by </s>
<s>  leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light
to be in a window of a publichouse </s>
<s>  it was a dirty place enough and i
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers </s>
<s>  but there was a good
fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various
liquors to drink </s>
<s>  also there were two doublebedded roomssuch as
they were the landlord said </s>
<s>  no other company was in the house than
the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the
little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been lowwater
mark too </s>
<s> 

with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came
ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boathook and all
else and hauled her up for the night </s>
<s>  we made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms </s>
<s>  herbert and startop
were to occupy one </s>
<s>  i and our charge the other </s>
<s>  we found the air as
carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life </s>
<s>  and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have
thought the family possessed </s>
<s>  but we considered ourselves well off
notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found </s>
<s> 

while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the
jackwho was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as
interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared
galley going up with the tide </s>
<s>  when i told him no he said she must have
gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there </s>
<s> 

they must ha thought better ont for some reason or another said the
jack and gone down </s>
<s> 

a fouroared galley did you say </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

a four said the jack and two sitters </s>
<s> 

did they come ashore here </s>
<s> 

they put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer </s>
<s>  id ha been
glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling
physic in it </s>
<s> 

why </s>
<s> 

i know why said the jack </s>
<s>  he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud
had washed into his throat </s>
<s> 

he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye
who seemed to rely greatly on his jackhe thinks they was what they
wasnt </s>
<s> 

i knows what i thinks observed the jack </s>
<s> 

you thinks custum ˜us jack </s>
<s>  said the landlord </s>
<s> 

i do said the jack </s>
<s> 

then youre wrong jack </s>
<s> 

am i </s>
<s> 

in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into
it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on
again </s>
<s>  he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could
afford to do anything </s>
<s> 

why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then
jack </s>
<s>  asked the landlord vacillating weakly </s>
<s> 

done with their buttons </s>
<s>  returned the jack </s>
<s>  chucked ˜em overboard </s>
<s> 
swallered ˜em </s>
<s>  sowed ˜em to come up small salad </s>
<s>  done with their
buttons </s>
<s> 

dont be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and
pathetic way </s>
<s> 

a custum ˜us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they
comes betwixt him and his own light </s>
<s>  a four and two sitters dont go
hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both
with and against another without there being custum ˜us at the bottom
of it </s>
<s>  saying which he went out in disdain </s>
<s>  and the landlord having no
one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject </s>
<s> 

this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy </s>
<s>  the dismal wind
was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and
i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened </s>
<s>  a fouroared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that i could not get rid of </s>
<s>  when i had induced provis to
go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this
time knew the state of the case and held another council </s>
<s>  whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamers time which would
be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the
morning was the question we discussed </s>
<s>  on the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the
steamers time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with
the tide </s>
<s>  having settled to do this we returned into the house and went
to bed </s>
<s> 

i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a
few hours </s>
<s>  when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house
the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled
me </s>
<s>  rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the
window </s>
<s>  it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw
two men looking into her </s>
<s>  they passed by under the window looking at
nothing else and they did not go down to the landingplace which i
could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the nore </s>
<s> 

my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going
away </s>
<s>  but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day
than i and were fatigued i forbore </s>
<s>  going back to my window i could
see the two men moving over the marsh </s>
<s>  in that light however i soon
lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and
fell asleep again </s>
<s> 

we were up early </s>
<s>  as we walked to and fro all four together before
breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen </s>
<s>  again our
charge was the least anxious of the party </s>
<s>  it was very likely that the
men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no
thought of us </s>
<s>  i tried to persuade myself that it was soas indeed
it might easily be </s>
<s>  however i proposed that he and i should walk away
together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take
us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about
noon </s>
<s>  this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he
and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern </s>
<s> 

he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder </s>
<s>  one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger
not he and that he was reassuring me </s>
<s>  we spoke very little </s>
<s>  as we
approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while
i went on to reconnoitre </s>
<s>  for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night </s>
<s>  he complied and i went on alone </s>
<s>  there was no boat off
the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there </s>
<s>  but to be sure the tide was
high and there might have been some footpints under water </s>
<s> 

when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i
waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited </s>
<s> 
sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round </s>
<s>  we got
aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer </s>
<s>  by that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one oclock and we began to look out for
her smoke </s>
<s> 

but it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer </s>
<s>  as they were coming on
at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity
of saying goodbye to herbert and startop </s>
<s>  we had all shaken hands
cordially and neither herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry when i
saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us and row out into the same track </s>
<s> 

a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamers smoke
by reason of the bend and wind of the river </s>
<s>  but now she was visible
coming head on </s>
<s>  i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide
that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit
quite still wrapped in his cloak </s>
<s>  he answered cheerily trust to me
dear boy and sat like a statue </s>
<s>  meantime the galley which was very
skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen
alongside </s>
<s>  leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept
alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled </s>
<s>  of the two sitters one held the rudderlines and looked at us
attentivelyas did all the rowers </s>
<s>  the other sitter was wrapped up
much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he looked at us </s>
<s>  not a word was spoken in either boat </s>
<s> 

startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first
and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face </s>
<s> 
she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder
and louder </s>
<s>  i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the
galley hailed us </s>
<s>  i answered </s>
<s> 

you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines </s>
<s> 
thats the man wrapped in the cloak </s>
<s>  his name is abel magwitch
otherwise provis </s>
<s>  i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender
and you to assist </s>
<s> 

at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew
he ran the galley abroad of us </s>
<s>  they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead
had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to
our gunwale before we knew what they were doing </s>
<s>  this caused great
confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and
heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt
her driving down upon us irresistibly </s>
<s>  in the same moment i saw the
steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoners shoulder and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically </s>
<s>  still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start
up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley </s>
<s>  still in the same moment i saw that the
face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago </s>
<s>  still in
the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer
and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me </s>
<s> 

it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand
millweirs and a thousand flashes of light </s>
<s>  that instant past i was
taken on board the galley </s>
<s>  herbert was there and startop was there </s>
<s>  but
our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone </s>
<s> 

what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of
her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore </s>
<s>  but the crew of the
galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern </s>
<s>  presently a dark object was seen in it
bearing towards us on the tide </s>
<s>  no man spoke but the steersman held up
his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and
true before it </s>
<s>  as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming
but not swimming freely </s>
<s>  he was taken on board and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles </s>
<s> 

the galley was kept steady and the silent eager lookout at the water
was resumed </s>
<s>  but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not
understanding what had happened came on at speed </s>
<s>  by the time she had
been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water </s>
<s>  the lookout was
kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone </s>
<s>  but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now </s>
<s> 

at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise </s>
<s>  here
i was able to get some comforts for magwitchprovis no longerwho
had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the
head </s>
<s> 

he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising </s>
<s>  the injury to
his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought
he had received against the side of the galley </s>
<s>  he added that he did not
pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but
that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him
that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone
overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of
our boat and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it had capsized
us </s>
<s>  he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each others arms and that there had been a struggle under water and
that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away </s>
<s> 

i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me </s>
<s> 
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard </s>
<s> 

when i asked this officers permission to change the prisoners
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the
publichouse he gave it readily </s>
<s>  merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him </s>
<s>  so the pocketbook
which had once been in my hands passed into the officers </s>
<s>  he further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london </s>
<s>  but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends </s>
<s> 

the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore </s>
<s>  his interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on </s>
<s>  probably it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely </s>
<s>  and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
various stages of decay </s>
<s> 

we remained at the publichouse until the tide turned and then magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board </s>
<s>  herbert and startop
were to get to london by land as soon as they could </s>
<s>  we had a doleful
parting and when i took my place by magwitchs side i felt that that
was my place henceforth while he lived </s>
<s> 

for now my repugnance to him had all melted away </s>
<s>  and in the hunted
wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately
gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a
series of years </s>
<s>  i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to
joe </s>
<s> 

his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on
and often he could not repress a groan </s>
<s>  i tried to rest him on the arm
i could use in any easy position </s>
<s>  but it was dreadful to think that
i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was
unquestionably best that he should die </s>
<s>  that there were still living
people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not
doubt </s>
<s>  that he would be leniently treated i could not hope </s>
<s>  he who had
been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken
prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his arrest </s>
<s> 

as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how
grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake </s>
<s> 

dear boy he answered im quite content to take my chance </s>
<s>  ive seen
my boy and he can be a gentleman without me </s>
<s> 

no </s>
<s>  i had thought about that while we had been there side by side </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s> 
apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmicks hint now </s>
<s> 
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to
the crown </s>
<s> 

lookee here dear boy said he its best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now </s>
<s>  only come to see me as if you come by chance
alonger wemmick </s>
<s>  sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the
last o many times and i dont ask no more </s>
<s> 

i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be
near you </s>
<s>  please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me </s>
<s> 

i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his
throatsoftened now like all the rest of him </s>
<s>  it was a good thing
that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not
otherwise have thought of until too latethat he need never know how
his hopes of enriching me had perished </s>

chapter lv

he was taken to the police court next day and would have been
immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped to
speak to his identity </s>
<s>  nobody doubted it </s>
<s>  but compeyson who had meant
to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give
the required evidence </s>
<s>  i had gone direct to <abvr> jaggers at his private
house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and <abvr>
jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing </s>
<s>  it was the sole
resource </s>
<s>  for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us </s>
<s> 

i imparted to <abvr> jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
fate of his wealth </s>
<s>  <abvr> jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialize
by and by and try at all events for some of it </s>
<s>  but he did not conceal
from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them </s>
<s>  i understood that very well </s>
<s>  i was not related to the
outlaw or connected with him by any recognizable tie </s>
<s>  he had put his
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension
and to do so now would be idle </s>
<s>  i had no claim and i finally resolved
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one </s>
<s> 

there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of magwitchs affairs </s>
<s>  when his body was found many
miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he
was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets notes were still
legible folded in a case he carried </s>
<s>  among these were the name of a
bankinghouse in new south wales where a sum of money was and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value </s>
<s>  both these heads of
information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to <abvr>
jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit </s>
<s>  his ignorance
poor fellow at last served him </s>
<s>  he never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe with <abvr> jaggerss aid </s>
<s> 

after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prisonship the witness
came and completed the easy case </s>
<s>  he was committed to take his trial at
the next sessions which would come on in a month </s>
<s> 

it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one
evening a good deal cast down and said

my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you </s>
<s> 

his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he
thought </s>
<s> 

we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am
very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me </s>
<s> 

herbert i shall always need you because i shall always love you </s>
<s>  but
my need is no greater now than at another time </s>
<s> 

you will be so lonely </s>
<s> 

i have not leisure to think of that said i </s>
<s>  you know that i am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i
should be with him all day long if i could </s>
<s>  and when i come away from
him you know that my thoughts are with him </s>
<s> 

the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both
of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words </s>
<s> 

my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our
separationfor it is very nearbe my justification for troubling you
about yourself </s>
<s>  have you thought of your future </s>
<s> 

no for i have been afraid to think of any future </s>
<s> 

but yours cannot be dismissed </s>
<s>  indeed my dear dear handel it must not
be dismissed </s>
<s>  i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly
words go with me </s>
<s> 

i will said i </s>
<s> 

in this branch house of ours handel we must have a

i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a
clerk </s>
<s> 

a clerk </s>
<s>  and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner </s>
<s>  now
handelin short my dear boy will you come to me </s>
<s> 

there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone
stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy </s>
<s> 

clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued
and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in
her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come
together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her
husbands friend that he is her friend too </s>
<s>  we should get on so well
handel </s>
<s> 

i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not
yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered </s>
<s>  firstly my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly </s>
<s> 
secondlyyes </s>
<s>  secondly there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative </s>
<s> 

but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury
to your business leave the question open for a little while

for any while cried herbert </s>
<s>  six months a year </s>
<s> 

not so long as that said i </s>
<s>  two or three months at most </s>
<s> 

herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week </s>
<s> 

and clara </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts </s>
<s>  but he wont last long </s>
<s>  <abvr> whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going </s>
<s> 

not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go </s>
<s> 

i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert </s>
<s>  and then i shall
come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i
will walk quietly into the nearest church </s>
<s>  remember </s>
<s>  the blessed darling
comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book
and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa </s>
<s>  what a fortune for the son of
my mother </s>
<s> 

on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbertfull
of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave meas he sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches </s>
<s>  i went into a coffeehouse to write a little note
to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and
over again and then went to my lonely homeif it deserved the name </s>
<s> 
for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere </s>
<s> 

on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an
unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door </s>
<s>  i had not seen him
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight </s>
<s>  and he had
come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure </s>
<s> 

the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted </s>
<s>  and it was from
the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being
always in trouble that i heard what i did </s>
<s>  i kept my ears open seeming
to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt </s>
<s>  i can only suppose now
that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to
deceive his own instruments </s>
<s>  you dont blame me i hope <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  i am
sure i tried to serve you with all my heart </s>
<s> 

i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship </s>
<s> 

thank you thank you very much </s>
<s>  its a bad job said wemmick
scratching his head and i assure you i havent been so cut up for a
long time </s>
<s>  what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property </s>
<s> 
dear me </s>
<s> 

what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property </s>
<s> 

yes to be sure said wemmick </s>
<s>  of course there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him and id put down a fivepound note myself
to get him out of it </s>
<s>  but what i look at is this </s>
<s>  the late compeyson
having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being
so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been
saved </s>
<s>  whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved </s>
<s> 
thats the difference between the property and the owner dont you
see </s>
<s> 

i invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to walworth </s>
<s>  he accepted the invitation </s>
<s>  while he
was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to
it and after having appeared rather fidgety

what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday <abvr> pip </s>
<s> 

why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months </s>
<s> 

these twelve years more likely said wemmick </s>
<s>  yes </s>
<s>  im going to take
a holiday </s>
<s>  more than that </s>
<s>  im going to take a walk </s>
<s>  more than that </s>
<s>  im
going to ask you to take a walk with me </s>
<s> 

i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then
when wemmick anticipated me </s>
<s> 

i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts
mr </s>
<s>  pip </s>
<s>  but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness </s>
<s> 
it aint a long walk and its an early one </s>
<s>  say it might occupy you
including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve </s>
<s>  couldnt you
stretch a point and manage it </s>
<s> 

he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little
to do for him </s>
<s>  i said i could manage itwould manage itand he was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too </s>
<s>  at his
particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half
past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time </s>
<s> 

punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday
morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking
tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on </s>
<s>  within there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits </s>
<s>  the aged must have
been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his
bedroom i observed that his bed was empty </s>
<s> 

when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was
considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishingrod and put
it over his shoulder </s>
<s>  why we are not going fishing </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s>  no
 returned wemmick but i like to walk with one </s>
<s> 

i thought this odd </s>
<s>  however i said nothing and we set off </s>
<s>  we went
towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said
suddenly

halloa </s>
<s>  heres a church </s>
<s> 

there was nothing very surprising in that </s>
<s>  but again i was rather
surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea

lets go in </s>
<s> 

we went in wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch and looked all
round </s>
<s>  in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coatpockets and
getting something out of paper there </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said he </s>
<s>  heres a couple of pair of gloves </s>
<s>  lets put ˜em
on </s>
<s> 

as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the postoffice was widened
to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions </s>
<s>  they
were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side
door escorting a lady </s>
<s> 

halloa </s>
<s>  said wemmick </s>
<s>  heres miss skiffins </s>
<s>  lets have a wedding </s>
<s> 

that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white </s>
<s>  the
aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of hymen </s>
<s>  the old gentleman however experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe
resistance </s>
<s>  by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to
perfection </s>
<s> 

the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails </s>
<s>  true to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of
his waistcoatpocket before the service began halloa </s>
<s>  heres a ring </s>
<s> 

i acted in the capacity of backer or bestman to the bridegroom </s>
<s>  while
a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babys made a feint
of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins </s>
<s>  the responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergymans being
unintentionally scandalized and it happened thus </s>
<s>  when he said who
giveth this woman to be married to this man </s>
<s>  the old gentleman not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments </s>
<s>  upon which the clergyman
said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man </s>
<s>  the old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the
bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p </s>
<s>  you know </s>
<s>  who
giveth </s>
<s>  to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying
that he gave all right john all right my boy </s>
<s>  and the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day </s>
<s> 

it was completely done however and when we were going out of church
wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and
put the cover on again </s>
<s>  <abvr> wemmick more heedful of the future put
her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green </s>
<s>  now <abvr> pip
 said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came
out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
weddingparty </s>
<s> 

breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green </s>
<s>  and there was a bagatelle
board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity </s>
<s>  it was pleasant to observe that <abvr> wemmick no longer
unwound wemmicks arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a
highbacked chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done </s>
<s> 

we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on
table wemmick said provided by contract you know </s>
<s>  dont be afraid of
it </s>
<s>  i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle
saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could </s>
<s> 

wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him
and wished him joy </s>
<s> 

thankee </s>
<s>  said wemmick rubbing his hands </s>
<s>  shes such a manager
of fowls you have no idea </s>
<s>  you shall have some eggs and judge for
yourself </s>
<s>  i say <abvr> pip </s>
<s>  calling me back and speaking low </s>
<s>  this is
altogether a walworth sentiment please </s>
<s> 

i understand </s>
<s>  not to be mentioned in little britain said i </s>
<s> 

wemmick nodded </s>
<s>  after what you let out the other day <abvr> jaggers
may as well not know of it </s>
<s>  he might think my brain was softening or
something of the kind </s>
<s> 




chapter lvi

he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions </s>
<s>  he had broken
two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty which increased daily </s>
<s>  it was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible </s>
<s>  therefore he spoke
very little </s>
<s>  but he was ever ready to listen to me </s>
<s>  and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he
ought to hear </s>
<s> 

being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after
the first day or so into the infirmary </s>
<s>  this gave me opportunities
of being with him that i could not otherwise have had </s>
<s>  and but for
his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a
determined prisonbreaker and i know not what else </s>
<s> 

although i saw him every day it was for only a short time </s>
<s>  hence the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state </s>
<s>  i
do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better </s>
<s>  he
wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day
when the prison door closed upon him </s>
<s> 

the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
who was tired out </s>
<s>  i sometimes derived an impression from his manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered
over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
circumstances </s>
<s>  but he never justified himself by a hint tending that
way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape </s>
<s> 

it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him </s>
<s>  a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with
a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small
redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child </s>
<s> 
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him
complain </s>
<s> 

when the sessions came round <abvr> jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions </s>
<s>  it
was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long
and was refused </s>
<s>  the trial came on at once and when he was put to the
bar he was seated in a chair </s>
<s>  no objection was made to my getting
close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he
stretched forth to me </s>
<s> 

the trial was very short and very clear </s>
<s>  such things as could be said
for him were saidhow he had taken to industrious habits and had
thriven lawfully and reputably </s>
<s>  but nothing could unsay the fact that
he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury </s>
<s>  it was
impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty </s>
<s> 

at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience
of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of
sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death </s>
<s> 
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me
i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw
twoandthirty men and women put before the judge to receive that
sentence together </s>
<s>  foremost among the twoandthirty was he </s>
<s>  seated
that he might get breath enough to keep life in him </s>
<s> 

the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment down
to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in
the rays of april sun </s>
<s>  penned in the dock as i again stood outside it
at the corner with his hand in mine were the twoandthirty men
and women </s>
<s>  some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and
weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about </s>
<s>  there
had been shrieks from among the women convicts </s>
<s>  but they had been
stilled and a hush had succeeded </s>
<s>  the sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great
gallery full of peoplea large theatrical audiencelooked on as the
twoandthirty and the judge were solemnly confronted </s>
<s>  then the judge
addressed them </s>
<s>  among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
been an offender against the laws </s>
<s>  who after repeated imprisonments and
punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years </s>
<s> 
and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his
escape and been resentenced to exile for life </s>
<s>  that miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed
from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life </s>
<s>  but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and
passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to
society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had
come back to the country where he was proscribed </s>
<s>  being here presently
denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had
resisted them and hadhe best knew whether by express design or in
the blindness of his hardihoodcaused the death of his denouncer to
whom his whole career was known </s>
<s>  the appointed punishment for his return
to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this
aggravated case he must prepare himself to die </s>
<s> 

the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of
light between the twoandthirty and the judge linking both together
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on
with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things
and cannot err </s>
<s>  rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this
way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence
of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again </s>
<s> 
there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say
to the rest </s>
<s>  then they were all formally doomed and some of them were
supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about </s>
<s>  he went last of all because of having to
be helped from his chair and to go very slowly </s>
<s>  and he held my hand
while all the others were removed and while the audience got up
putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and
pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me </s>
<s> 

i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorders
report was made </s>
<s>  but in the dread of his lingering on i began that
night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting
forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my
sake </s>
<s>  i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could </s>
<s>  and when i
had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the
crown itself </s>
<s>  for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took
no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals </s>
<s>  and after i had sent them in i could not keep away
from the places where they were but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when i was near them </s>
<s>  in this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening
wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions </s>
<s>  to
the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty
spring night with their ranges of stern shutup mansions and their
long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association </s>
<s> 

the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more
strictly kept </s>
<s>  seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down
at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was
willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my
designs </s>
<s>  nobody was hard with him or with me </s>
<s>  there was duty to be
done and it was done but not harshly </s>
<s>  the officer always gave me the
assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the
room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses
malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked </s>
<s>  always
joined in the same report </s>
<s> 

as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would
subside again </s>
<s>  sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then
he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to
understand his meaning very well </s>
<s> 

the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change
in him than i had seen yet </s>
<s>  his eyes were turned towards the door and
lighted up as i entered </s>
<s> 

dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed </s>
<s>  i thought you was late </s>
<s> 
but i knowed you couldnt be that </s>
<s> 

it is just the time said i </s>
<s>  i waited for it at the gate </s>
<s> 

you always waits at the gate </s>
<s>  dont you dear boy </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s>  not to lose a moment of the time </s>
<s> 

thankee dear boy thankee </s>
<s>  god bless you </s>
<s>  youve never deserted me
dear boy </s>
<s> 

i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once
meant to desert him </s>
<s> 

and whats the best of all he said youve been more comfortable
alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone </s>
<s> 
thats best of all </s>
<s> 

he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty </s>
<s>  do what he would
and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling </s>
<s> 

are you in much pain today </s>
<s> 

i dont complain of none dear boy </s>
<s> 

you never do complain </s>
<s> 

he had spoken his last words </s>
<s>  he smiled and i understood his touch to
mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast </s>
<s>  i laid it
there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it </s>
<s> 

the allotted time ran out while we were thus </s>
<s>  but looking round i
found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered
you neednt go yet </s>
<s>  i thanked him gratefully and asked might i
speak to him if he can hear me </s>
<s> 

the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away </s>
<s>  the change
though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me </s>
<s> 

dear magwitch i must tell you now at last </s>
<s>  you understand what i
say </s>
<s> 

a gentle pressure on my hand </s>
<s> 

you had a child once whom you loved and lost </s>
<s> 

a stronger pressure on my hand </s>
<s> 

she lived and found powerful friends </s>
<s>  she is living now </s>
<s>  she is a lady
and very beautiful </s>
<s>  and i love her </s>
<s> 

with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips </s>
<s>  then
he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on
it </s>
<s>  the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and
his head dropped quietly on his breast </s>
<s> 

mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men
who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better
words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him
a sinner </s>
<s> 




chapter lvii

now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them </s>
<s>  at once i put bills
up in the windows </s>
<s>  for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs </s>
<s>  i ought
rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that i was falling very ill </s>
<s>  the late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away </s>
<s>  i knew that it
was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless
as to that </s>
<s> 

for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the flooranywhere
according as i happened to sink downwith a heavy head and aching
limbs and no purpose and no power </s>
<s>  then there came one night which
appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror </s>
<s> 
and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i
found i could not do so </s>
<s> 

whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night
groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there </s>
<s>  whether i had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror
not knowing how i had got out of bed </s>
<s>  whether i had found myself
lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up
the stairs and that the lights were blown out </s>
<s>  whether i had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning
of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making </s>
<s> 
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss
havisham was consuming within itthese were things that i tried to
settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on
my bed </s>
<s>  but the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them
disordering them all and it was through the vapor at last that i saw
two men looking at me </s>
<s> 

what do you want </s>
<s>  i asked starting </s>
<s>  i dont know you </s>
<s> 

well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the
shoulder this is a matter that youll soon arrange i dare say but
youre arrested </s>
<s> 

what is the debt </s>
<s> 

hundred and twentythree pound fifteen six </s>
<s>  jewellers account i
think </s>
<s> 

what is to be done </s>
<s> 

you had better come to my house said the man </s>
<s>  i keep a very nice
house </s>
<s> 

i made some attempt to get up and dress myself </s>
<s>  when i next attended
to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me </s>
<s>  i
still lay there </s>
<s> 

you see my state said i </s>
<s>  i would come with you if i could </s>
<s>  but
indeed i am quite unable </s>
<s>  if you take me from here i think i shall die
by the way </s>
<s> 

perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to
believe that i was better than i thought </s>
<s>  forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread i dont know what they did
except that they forbore to remove me </s>
<s> 

that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that
i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i
confounded impossible existences with my own identity </s>
<s>  that i was a
brick in the housewall and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me </s>
<s>  that i was a steel beam of a
vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered
off </s>
<s>  that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own
remembrance and did in some sort know at the time </s>
<s>  that i sometimes
struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and
that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and
would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me
down i also knew at the time </s>
<s>  but above all i knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these peoplewho when i was very ill would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face
and would be much dilated in sizeabove all i say i knew that there
was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to
settle down into the likeness of joe </s>
<s> 

after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that
while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did
not change </s>
<s>  whoever came about me still settled down into joe </s>
<s>  i opened
my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe </s>
<s> 
i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the windowseat smoking
his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe </s>
<s>  i asked for cooling
drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joes </s>
<s>  i sank back on
my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of joe </s>
<s> 

at last one day i took courage and said is it joe </s>
<s> 

and the dear old homevoice answered which it air old chap </s>
<s> 

o joe you break my heart </s>
<s>  look angry at me joe </s>
<s>  strike me joe </s>
<s>  tell
me of my ingratitude </s>
<s>  dont be so good to me </s>
<s> 

for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and
put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him </s>
<s> 

which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends </s>
<s> 
and when youre well enough to go out for a ridewhat larks </s>
<s> 

after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards
me wiping his eyes </s>
<s>  and as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god
bless him </s>
<s>  o god bless this gentle christian man </s>
<s> 

joes eyes were red when i next found him beside me </s>
<s>  but i was holding
his hand and we both felt happy </s>
<s> 

how long dear joe </s>
<s> 

which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old
chap </s>
<s> 

yes joe </s>
<s> 

its the end of may pip </s>
<s>  tomorrow is the first of june </s>
<s> 

and have you been here all that time dear joe </s>
<s> 

pretty nigh old chap </s>
<s>  for as i says to biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and
being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoeleather but wealth were not a object on his part and
marriage were the great wish of his hart

it is so delightful to hear you joe </s>
<s>  but i interrupt you in what you
said to biddy </s>
<s> 

which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and
that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble </s>
<s>  and biddy her word were ˜go to him
without loss of time </s>
<s>  that said joe summing up with his judicial
air were the word of biddy </s>
<s>  ˜go to him biddy say ˜without loss of
time </s>
<s>  in short i shouldnt greatly deceive you joe added after a
little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that
young woman were ˜without a minutes loss of time </s>
<s> 

there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked
to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that
i was to submit myself to all his orders </s>
<s>  so i kissed his hand and lay
quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it </s>
<s> 

evidently biddy had taught joe to write </s>
<s>  as i lay in bed looking at him
it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter </s>
<s>  my bedstead divested of its
curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sittingroom as
the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day </s>
<s>  at my own
writingtable pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles
joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the
pentray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his
sleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer </s>
<s>  it was
necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow
and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin </s>
<s>  and
when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen
spluttering extensively </s>
<s>  he had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into
space and seemed quite satisfied with the result </s>
<s>  occasionally he was
tripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock </s>
<s>  but on the whole
he got on very well indeed </s>
<s>  and when he had signed his name and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with
his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the
effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there
with unbounded satisfaction </s>
<s> 

not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to
talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day </s>
<s>  he
shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered </s>
<s> 

is she dead joe </s>
<s> 

why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way
of getting at it by degrees i wouldnt go so far as to say that for
thats a deal to say </s>
<s>  but she aint

living joe </s>
<s> 

thats nigher where it is said joe </s>
<s>  she aint living </s>
<s> 

did she linger long joe </s>
<s> 

arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you
was put to it a week said joe </s>
<s>  still determined on my account to
come at everything by degrees </s>
<s> 

dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property </s>
<s> 

well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most
of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella </s>
<s>  but she had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the
accident leaving a cool four thousand to <abvr> matthew pocket </s>
<s>  and why
do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand
unto him </s>
<s>  ˜because of pips account of him the said matthew </s>
<s>  i am told
by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as
if it did him infinite good ˜account of him the said matthew </s>
<s>  and a
cool four thousand pip </s>
<s> 

i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds </s>
<s>  but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool </s>
<s> 

this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i
had done </s>
<s>  i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies </s>
<s> 

miss sarah said joe she have twentyfive pound perannium fur to
buy pills on account of being bilious </s>
<s>  miss georgiana she have twenty
pound down </s>

chap </s>

<s> 

joe nodded </s>
<s>  <abvr> camels by which i presently understood he meant
camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in
spirits when she wake up in the night </s>
<s> 

the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give
me great confidence in joes information </s>
<s>  and now said joe you
aint that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful today </s>
<s>  old orlick hes been a bustin open a
dwellingouse </s>

whose </s>
<s>  said i </s>
<s> 

not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said
joe apologetically </s>

castles must not be busted ˜cept when done in war time </s>
<s>  and wotsumeer
the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart </s>
<s> 

is it pumblechooks house that has been broken into then </s>
<s> 

thats it pip said joe </s>
<s>  and they took his till and they took his
cashbox and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles

up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out </s>
<s>  but he knowed
orlick and orlicks in the county jail </s>
<s> 

by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation </s>
<s>  i was slow
to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe
stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again </s>
<s> 

for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need
that i was like a child in his hands </s>
<s>  he would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive
protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone </s>
<s>  he did everything for me except the household work for which
he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on
his first arrival </s>
<s>  which i do assure you pip he would often say in
explanation of that liberty </s>
<s>  i found her a tapping the spare bed like
a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale </s>
<s> 
which she would have tapped yourn next and drawd it off with you a
laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the souptureen and wegetabledishes and the wine and spirits in your
wellington boots </s>
<s> 

we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship </s>
<s>  and when the day
came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up
took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were
still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his great nature </s>
<s> 

and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass
and sweet summer scents filled all the air </s>
<s>  the day happened to be
sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought
how it had grown and changed and how the little wildflowers had been
forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and
by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning
and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace </s>
<s>  but when i heard the sunday
bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt
that i was not nearly thankful enoughthat i was too weak yet to be
even thatand i laid my head on joes shoulder as i had laid it long
ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much
for my young senses </s>
<s> 

more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used
to talk lying on the grass at the old battery </s>
<s>  there was no change
whatever in joe </s>
<s>  exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my
eyes still </s>
<s>  just as simply faithful and as simply right </s>
<s> 

when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried meso
easily </s>
<s> across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful
christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes </s>
<s>  we had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of
my late history he was acquainted with </s>
<s>  i was so doubtful of myself now
and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i
ought to refer to it when he did not </s>
<s> 

have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further
consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was </s>
<s> 

i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap </s>
<s> 

did you hear who it was joe </s>
<s> 

well </s>
<s>  i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you
the banknotes at the jolly bargemen pip </s>
<s> 

so it was </s>
<s> 

astonishing </s>
<s>  said joe in the placidest way </s>
<s> 

did you hear that he was dead joe </s>
<s>  i presently asked with increasing
diffidence </s>
<s> 

which </s>
<s>  him as sent the banknotes pip </s>
<s> 

yes </s>
<s> 

i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather
evasively at the windowseat as i did hear tell that how he were
something or another in a general way in that direction </s>
<s> 

did you hear anything of his circumstances joe </s>
<s> 

not partickler pip </s>
<s> 

if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and
came to my sofa </s>
<s> 

lookee here old chap said joe bending over me </s>
<s>  ever the best of
friends </s>
<s>  aint us pip </s>
<s> 

i was ashamed to answer him </s>
<s> 

wery good then said joe as if i had answered </s>
<s>  thats all right </s>
<s> 
thats agreed upon </s>
<s>  then why go into subjects old chap which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary </s>
<s>  theres subjects enough
as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones </s>
<s>  lord </s>
<s>  to think of your
poor sister and her rampages </s>
<s>  and dont you remember tickler </s>
<s> 

i do indeed joe </s>
<s> 

lookee here old chap said joe </s>
<s>  i done what i could to keep you
and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations </s>
<s>  for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it
were not so much said joe in his favorite argumentative way that
she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that
she dropped into you always heavier for it </s>
<s>  i noticed that </s>
<s>  it aint a
grab at a mans whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your
sister was quite welcome that ˜ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment </s>
<s>  but when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up
and says to himself ˜where is the good as you are a doing </s>
<s>  i grant you
i see the ˜arm says the man ˜but i dont see the good </s>
<s>  i call upon
you sir therefore to pint out the good </s>
<s> 

the man says </s>
<s>  i observed as joe waited for me to speak </s>
<s> 

the man says joe assented </s>
<s>  is he right that man </s>
<s> 

dear joe he is always right </s>
<s> 

well old chap said joe then abide by your words </s>
<s>  if hes always
right which in general hes more likely wrong hes right when he says
this </s>
<s>  supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you
was a little child you kep it mostly because you knowd as j </s>
<s>  gargerys
power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations </s>
<s>  theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects </s>
<s>  biddy giv herself a
deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i
should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should
so put it </s>
<s>  both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical
arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say </s>
<s>  namely </s>
<s> 
you mustnt go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your
wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets </s>
<s> 

the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and
kindness with which biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so
soonhad prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind </s>
<s>  but
whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had
all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not
understand </s>
<s> 

another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to
develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of was this </s>
<s>  as i became stronger and better joe became a little less
easy with me </s>
<s>  in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names
the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears </s>
<s>  i too had
fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me </s>
<s>  but
imperceptibly though i held by them fast joes hold upon them began
to slacken </s>
<s>  and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was
all mine </s>
<s> 

ah </s>
<s>  had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that
in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off </s>
<s>  had i given
joes innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got
stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away </s>
<s> 

it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
temple gardens leaning on joes arm that i saw this change in him very
plainly </s>
<s>  we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the
river and i chanced to say as we got up

see joe </s>
<s>  i can walk quite strongly </s>
<s>  now you shall see me walk back by
myself </s>
<s> 

which do not overdo it pip said joe </s>
<s>  but i shall be happy fur to
see you able sir </s>
<s> 

the last word grated on me </s>
<s>  but how could i remonstrate </s>
<s>  i walked no
further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be
weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm </s>
<s>  joe gave it me but was
thoughtful </s>
<s> 

i for my part was thoughtful too </s>
<s>  for how best to check this growing
change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts </s>
<s>  that i
was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come
down to i do not seek to conceal </s>
<s>  but i hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one </s>
<s>  he would want to help me out of his little
savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i
must not suffer him to do it </s>
<s> 

it was a thoughtful evening with both of us </s>
<s>  but before we went to
bed i had resolved that i would wait over tomorrowtomorrow being
sundayand would begin my new course with the new week </s>
<s>  on monday
morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts
that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go
out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever </s>
<s>  as i
cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too </s>
<s> 

we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and
then walked in the fields </s>
<s> 

i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said </s>
<s> 

dear old pip old chap youre amost come round sir </s>
<s> 

it has been a memorable time for me joe </s>
<s> 

likeways for myself sir joe returned </s>
<s> 

we have had a time together joe that i can never forget </s>
<s>  there were
days once i know that i did for a while forget </s>
<s>  but i never shall
forget these </s>
<s> 

pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has
been larks </s>
<s>  and dear sir what have been betwixt ushave been </s>
<s> 

at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done
all through my recovery </s>
<s>  he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well
as in the morning </s>
<s> 

yes dear joe quite </s>
<s> 

and are always a getting stronger old chap </s>
<s> 

yes dear joe steadily </s>
<s> 

joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and
said in what i thought a husky voice good night </s>
<s> 

when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of
my resolution to tell joe all without delay </s>
<s>  i would tell him before
breakfast </s>
<s>  i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him </s>
<s> 
for it was the first day i had been up early </s>
<s>  i went to his room and
he was not there </s>
<s>  not only was he not there but his box was gone </s>
<s> 

i hurried then to the breakfasttable and on it found a letter </s>
<s>  these
were its brief contents </s>
<s> 

not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear
pip and will do better without jo </s>
<s> 

p </s>
<s> s </s>
<s>  ever the best of friends </s>
<s> 

enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i
had been arrested </s>
<s>  down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite
recovered </s>
<s>  i had never dreamed of joes having paid the money </s>
<s>  but joe
had paid it and the receipt was in his name </s>
<s> 

what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and
there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance
with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts
and had formed into a settled purpose </s>
<s> 

the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how
humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost
all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time </s>
<s>  then i would say to her biddy i think you once
liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away
from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since </s>
<s> 
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like
a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier
of you that i wasnot much but a little </s>
<s>  and biddy it shall rest
with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i
shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer </s>
<s>  and now
dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man
for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you </s>
<s> 

such was my purpose </s>
<s>  after three days more of recovery i went down to
the old place to put it in execution </s>
<s>  and how i sped in it is all i have
left to tell </s>

chapter lviii

the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before i got there </s>
<s>  i found the
blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a
great change in the boars demeanour </s>
<s>  whereas the boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property
the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of
property </s>
<s> 

it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so
often made so easily </s>
<s>  the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom
which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
postchaises up the yard </s>
<s>  but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom </s>
<s> 

early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled
round by satis house </s>
<s>  there were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of
the household furniture and effects next week </s>
<s>  the house itself was to
be sold as old building materials and pulled down </s>
<s>  lot  was marked in
whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house </s>
<s>  lot  on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up </s>
<s>  other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already </s>
<s>  stepping in for a moment at the open gate and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there i saw the auctioneers clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler pen in
hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often
pushed along to the tune of old clem </s>
<s> 

when i got back to my breakfast in the boars coffeeroom i found <abvr>
pumblechook conversing with the landlord </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook not improved
in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and
addressed me in the following terms </s>
<s> 

young man i am sorry to see you brought low </s>
<s>  but what else could be
expected </s>
<s>  what else could be expected </s>
<s> 

as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it </s>
<s> 

william said <abvr> pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table </s>
<s> 
and has it come to this </s>
<s>  has it come to this </s>
<s> 

i frowningly sat down to my breakfast </s>
<s>  <abvr> pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my teabefore i could touch the teapotwith the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last </s>
<s> 

william said <abvr> pumblechook mournfully put the salt on </s>
<s>  in
happier times addressing me i think you took sugar </s>
<s>  and did you take
milk </s>
<s>  you did </s>
<s>  sugar and milk </s>
<s>  william bring a watercress </s>
<s> 

thank you said i shortly but i dont eat watercresses </s>
<s> 

you dont eat ˜em returned <abvr> pumblechook sighing and nodding
his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall </s>
<s>  true </s>
<s> 
the simple fruits of the earth </s>
<s>  no </s>
<s>  you neednt bring any william </s>
<s> 

i went on with my breakfast and <abvr> pumblechook continued to stand over
me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did </s>
<s> 

little more than skin and bone </s>
<s>  mused <abvr> pumblechook aloud </s>
<s>  and yet
when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore
him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach </s>
<s> 

this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i </s>
<s> 
 and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers </s>
<s> 

hah </s>
<s>  he went on handing me the bread and butter </s>
<s>  and air you a going
to joseph </s>
<s> 

in heavens name said i firing in spite of myself what does it
matter to you where i am going </s>
<s>  leave that teapot alone </s>
<s> 

it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook
the opportunity he wanted </s>
<s> 

yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in
question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot
alone </s>
<s>  you are right young man </s>
<s>  for once you are right </s>
<s>  i forgit myself
when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated
by the ˜olesome nourishment of your forefathers </s>
<s>  and yet said
pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at
arms length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy
infancy </s>
<s>  tell me not it cannot be </s>
<s>  i tell you this is him </s>
<s> 

a low murmur from the two replied </s>
<s>  the waiter appeared to be
particularly affected </s>
<s> 

this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shaycart </s>
<s>  this
is him as i have seen brought up by hand </s>
<s>  this is him untoe the sister
of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana mria from
her own mother let him deny it if he can </s>
<s> 

the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave
the case a black look </s>
<s> 

young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old
fashion you air a going to joseph </s>
<s>  what does it matter to me you
ask me where you air a going </s>
<s>  i say to you sir you air a going to
joseph </s>
<s> 

the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that </s>
<s> 

now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph </s>
<s>  here is squires of
the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william
which his fathers name was potkins if i do not deceive myself </s>
<s> 

you do not sir said william </s>
<s> 

in their presence pursued pumblechook i will tell you young
man what to say to joseph </s>
<s>  says you joseph i have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortuns </s>
<s>  i will name no
names joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have
seen that man </s>
<s> 

i swear i dont see him here said i </s>
<s> 

say that likewise retorted pumblechook </s>
<s>  say you said that and even
joseph will probably betray surprise </s>
<s> 

there you quite mistake him said i </s>
<s>  i know better </s>
<s> 

says you pumblechook went on ˜joseph i have seen that man and
that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice </s>
<s>  he knows your
character joseph and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and
ignorance </s>
<s>  and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of
gratitoode </s>
<s>  yes joseph says you here pumblechook shook his head and
hand at me ˜he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode </s>
<s> 
he knows it joseph as none can </s>
<s>  you do not know it joseph having no
call to know it but that man do </s>
<s> 

windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face
to talk thus to mine </s>
<s> 

says you ˜joseph he gave me a little message which i will now
repeat </s>
<s>  it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of
providence </s>
<s>  he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it
plain </s>
<s>  it pinted out this writing joseph </s>
<s>  reward of ingratitoode to his
earliest benefactor and founder of fortuns </s>
<s>  but that man said he did
not repent of what he had done joseph </s>
<s>  not at all </s>
<s>  it was right to do
it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it
again </s>
<s> 

its pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast
that the man did not say what he had done and would do again </s>
<s> 

squires of the boar </s>
<s>  pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and
william </s>
<s>  i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down
town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to
do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again </s>
<s> 

with those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air
and left the house </s>
<s>  leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
the virtues of that same indefinite it </s>
<s>  i was not long after him in
leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him
holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select
group who honored me with very unfavorable glances as i passed on the
opposite side of the way </s>
<s> 

but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be
contrasted with this brazen pretender </s>
<s>  i went towards them slowly for
my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew
nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
further and further behind </s>
<s> 

the june weather was delicious </s>
<s>  the sky was blue the larks were soaring
high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful
and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet </s>
<s>  many pleasant
pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the
better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at
my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i had proved beguiled
my way </s>
<s>  they awakened a tender emotion in me </s>
<s>  for my heart was softened
by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one
who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings
had lasted many years </s>
<s> 

the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen </s>
<s>  but the
little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness
sake took me past it </s>
<s>  i was disappointed to find that the day was a
holiday </s>
<s>  no children were there and biddys house was closed </s>
<s>  some
hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before
she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated </s>
<s> 

but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under
the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joes hammer </s>
<s>  long
after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it
and found it but a fancy all was still </s>
<s>  the limes were there and the
white thorns were there and the chestnuttrees were there and their
leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen </s>
<s>  but the clink of
joes hammer was not in the midsummer wind </s>
<s> 

almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw
it at last and saw that it was closed </s>
<s>  no gleam of fire no glittering
shower of sparks no roar of bellows </s>
<s>  all shut up and still </s>
<s> 

but the house was not deserted and the best parlor seemed to be in use
for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window
was open and gay with flowers </s>
<s>  i went softly towards it meaning to peep
over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in arm </s>
<s> 

at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but
in another moment she was in my embrace </s>
<s>  i wept to see her and she wept
to see me </s>
<s>  i because she looked so fresh and pleasant </s>
<s>  she because i
looked so worn and white </s>
<s> 

but dear biddy how smart you are </s>
<s> 

yes dear pip </s>
<s> 

and joe how smart you are </s>

yes dear old pip old chap </s>
<s> 

i looked at both of them from one to the other and then

its my weddingday </s>
<s>  cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am
married to joe </s>
<s> 

they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on
the old deal table </s>
<s>  biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joes
restoring touch was on my shoulder </s>
<s>  which he warnt strong enough my
dear fur to be surprised said joe </s>
<s>  and biddy said i ought to
have thought of it dear joe but i was too happy </s>
<s>  they were both so
overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to
them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day
complete </s>
<s> 

my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed
this last baffled hope to joe </s>
<s>  how often while he was with me in my
illness had it risen to my lips </s>
<s>  how irrevocable would have been his
knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour </s>
<s> 

dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world
and if you could have seen him by my bed you would havebut no you
couldnt love him better than you do </s>
<s> 

no i couldnt indeed said biddy </s>
<s> 

and dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will
make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble joe </s>
<s> 

joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before
his eyes </s>
<s> 

and joe and biddy both as you have been to church today and are in
charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you
have done for me and all i have so ill repaid </s>
<s>  and when i say that i am
going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall
never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me
out of prison and have sent it to you dont think dear joe and biddy
that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i could cancel
a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could </s>
<s> 

they were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no
more </s>
<s> 

but i must say more </s>
<s>  dear joe i hope you will have children to love
and that some little fellow will sit in this chimneycorner of a winter
night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
ever </s>
<s>  dont tell him joe that i was thankless </s>
<s>  dont tell him biddy
that i was ungenerous and unjust </s>
<s>  only tell him that i honored you both
because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said
it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did </s>
<s> 

i aint a going said joe from behind his sleeve to tell him
nothink o that natur pip </s>
<s>  nor biddy aint </s>
<s>  nor yet no one aint </s>
<s> 

and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind
hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me </s>
<s>  pray let me hear you
say the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then
i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of
me in the time to come </s>
<s> 

o dear old pip old chap said joe </s>
<s>  god knows as i forgive you if i
have anythink to forgive </s>
<s> 

amen </s>
<s>  and god knows i do </s>
<s>  echoed biddy </s>
<s> 

now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few
minutes by myself </s>
<s>  and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go
with me as far as the fingerpost dear joe and biddy before we say
goodbye </s>
<s> 



i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition
with my creditorswho gave me ample time to pay them in fulland i
went out and joined herbert </s>
<s>  within a month i had quitted england
and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co </s>

months i assumed my first undivided responsibility </s>

old bill barleys growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to
marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until
he brought her back </s>
<s> 

many a year went round before i was a partner in the house </s>
<s>  but i lived
happily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my
debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe </s>
<s>  it
was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to
herbert </s>
<s>  but he then declared that the secret of herberts partnership
had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it </s>
<s>  so he
told it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow
and i were not the worse friends for the long concealment </s>
<s>  i must not
leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made
mints of money </s>
<s>  we were not in a grand way of business but we had a
good name and worked for our profits and did very well </s>
<s>  we owed so
much to herberts ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often
wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i
was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude
had never been in him at all but had been in me </s>

chapter lix

for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily
eyesthough they had both been often before my fancy in the
eastwhen upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door </s>
<s>  i touched it
so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen </s>
<s>  there smoking his
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as
ever though a little gray sat joe </s>
<s>  and there fenced into the corner
with joes leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire
wasi again </s>
<s> 

we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe
delighted when i took another stool by the childs side but i did not
rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and
we think he do </s>
<s> 

i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we
talked immensely understanding one another to perfection </s>
<s>  and i took
him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife
of the above </s>
<s> 

biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl
lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days </s>
<s>  or
lend him at all events </s>
<s> 

no no said biddy gently </s>
<s>  you must marry </s>
<s> 

so herbert and clara say but i dont think i shall biddy </s>
<s>  i have so
settled down in their home that its not at all likely </s>
<s>  i am already
quite an old bachelor </s>
<s> 

biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and
then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine </s>
<s> 
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddys
weddingring that had a very pretty eloquence in it </s>
<s> 

dear pip said biddy you are sure you dont fret for her </s>
<s> 

o noi think not biddy </s>
<s> 

tell me as an old old friend </s>
<s>  have you quite forgotten her </s>
<s> 

my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there and little that ever had any place there </s>
<s>  but that
poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddyall gone
by </s>
<s> 

nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake </s>
<s> 
yes even so </s>
<s>  for estellas sake </s>
<s> 

i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being
separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality
and meanness </s>
<s>  and i had heard of the death of her husband from an
accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse </s>
<s>  this release had
befallen her some two years before </s>
<s>  for anything i knew she was married
again </s>
<s> 

the early dinner hour at joes left me abundance of time without
hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark </s>
<s> 
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place </s>
<s> 

there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the
wall of the old garden </s>
<s>  the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin </s>
<s>  a gate in
the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in </s>
<s> 

a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it </s>
<s>  but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the
moon was coming and the evening was not dark </s>
<s>  i could trace out where
every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been
and where the gates and where the casks </s>
<s>  i had done so and was looking
along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it </s>
<s> 

the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced </s>
<s>  it had been moving
towards me but it stood still </s>
<s>  as i drew nearer i saw it to be the
figure of a woman </s>
<s>  as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when
it stopped and let me come up with it </s>
<s>  then it faltered as if much
surprised and uttered my name and i cried out

estella </s>
<s> 

i am greatly changed </s>
<s>  i wonder you know me </s>
<s> 

the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained </s>
<s>  those attractions in it
i had seen before </s>
<s>  what i had never seen before was the saddened
softened light of the once proud eyes </s>
<s>  what i had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand </s>
<s> 

we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years
it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our
first meeting was </s>
<s>  do you often come back </s>
<s> 

i have never been here since </s>
<s> 

nor i </s>
<s> 

the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling which had passed away </s>
<s>  the moon began to rise and i thought of
the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on
earth </s>
<s> 

estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us </s>
<s> 

i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been
prevented by many circumstances </s>
<s>  poor poor old place </s>
<s> 

the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes </s>
<s>  not knowing
that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said
quietly

were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this
condition </s>
<s> 

yes estella </s>
<s> 

the ground belongs to me </s>
<s>  it is the only possession i have not
relinquished </s>
<s>  everything else has gone from me little by little but i
have kept this </s>
<s>  it was the subject of the only determined resistance i
made in all the wretched years </s>
<s> 

is it to be built on </s>
<s> 

at last it is </s>
<s>  i came here to take leave of it before its change </s>
<s>  and
you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wandereryou
live abroad still </s>
<s> 

still </s>
<s> 

and do well i am sure </s>
<s> 

i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and thereforeyes i do
well </s>
<s> 

i have often thought of you said estella </s>
<s> 

have you </s>
<s> 

of late very often </s>
<s>  there was a long hard time when i kept far from me
the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant
of its worth </s>
<s>  but since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart </s>
<s> 

you have always held your place in my heart i answered </s>
<s> 

and we were silent again until she spoke </s>
<s> 

i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot </s>
<s>  i am very glad to do so </s>
<s> 

glad to part again estella </s>
<s>  to me parting is a painful thing </s>
<s>  to me
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful </s>
<s> 

but you said to me returned estella very earnestly ˜god bless you
god forgive you </s>
<s>  and if you could say that to me then you will not
hesitate to say that to me nownow when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be </s>
<s>  i have been bent and broken buti hopeinto a better
shape </s>
<s>  be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are
friends </s>
<s> 

we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from
the bench </s>
<s> 

and will continue friends apart said estella </s>
<s> 

i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place </s>
<s>  and as
the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the
evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her </s>
<s>
